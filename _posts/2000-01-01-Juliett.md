# Hold My Hand & Tell Me It's Okay
```
Needed:
        3+ players
        A timer

Setup:
        Wash your hands. With soap.
        Form a circle, palms touching.
        Left palm up, right palm down.

Theme:
        You are in a life-threatening situation.
        You each currently feel somewhat responsible.

Intro:
        As a group, decide on genre, location, and danger.

        Introduce your character with:
        Name, two truths, and a lie.

Rounds:
        There are three rounds - 15, 10, & 5 minutes respectively.

Turns:
        On your turn, pick another player.
        In character, speak to them about the situation and either:
                -Something about yourself.
                -Something about them.
                -Something about another player.

                (You may never voice full responsibility.)

        End your turn - Change a hand.
        Choose the position that best reflects your thoughts.
                Palm up - I still feel guilty.
                Palm down - You're not at fault.
                Switch hand location - You may be at fault.

End of round:
        Rounds end when time is up.

        Less than three pairs of palms touching?
                Danger climaxes. Everybody loses.
                Players narrate the ending from their perspective.

        Anybody not touching palms with someone?
                Danger claims that player.
                That player narrates their ending.

End of game:
        Are all palms touching?
                Players have forgiven each other.
                Danger climaxes, but everybody wins.
                Players narrate forgiveness and ending from their perspective.

# Fade In
```
Players sit around a typewriter.

Their boss comes in the room.

"How's that screenplay coming along?" Blank stares. "Did I forget to tell you to do it? Why didn't you idiots remind me?! We needed it yesterday! Get to it! I'll pop in with some notes from time to time. Get it done." He slams the door.

GAMEPLAY:
Players each take 5 minute turns working on a screenplay. The other players are allowed to read along with the writing, and can talk and make suggestions, but whoever's turn it is has final say, and once their turn is over what they've written can't be edited.

At the beginning of each turn, a d10 is rolled, wherein the boss pokes his head in and gives you feedback that must be followed during that turn:

1:  Somebody dies
2:  Focus on the love subplot
3:  Make a low-brow joke
4:  Expose character flaw in the hero.
5:  Plug Pepsi
6:  Increase the stakes!!!
7:  Give villain a relatable moment.
8:  Flashback!!!
9:  Make tasteful allusion to classic literature for the critics.
10: Sex it up.

After everybody's had three turns, the players have to act it out.

PRO MODE:
Use two d10.

# Committed!
```
This is insane! You wake up in a room with complete strangers and no memories. You have ONE burning question and some hazy, half-formed impressions. Can all of you work to piece the threads together and discover a way out, or will you prove yourselves worthy of being committed?

Players will take turns asking their one burning question and the group will answer it together, in an effort to determine who and where they are, why they are there and how they can escape. Sounds easy right? Not so fast! 

You may ask only one "Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How" question, BUT one that is given to you by Google's auto completion. (For instance: "How did I ..." "Why is ..." "When will we ..." ) Type in the beginning of your question and pick the suggestion you like best. This is what you need to know. The others will help you answer it, just as you help them with their question. 

If the players can craft a story that makes any sense of who they are, and why they are there they are free to go. If not, they are deemed fit to be committed!

# The Cooking Show RPG Challenge
```
INTRO
One player is the Tasting Judge; the others are Chefs. 

The Tasting Judge sets a tone and theme for the competition (example: comedic and camping food) with an introductory speech. Then, each Chef has 10 seconds to talk about themselves.

Each Chef rolls one Scattergories letter die three times. They must come up with an ingredient starting with the letter from their result in 10 seconds; these are ingredients in their dish. 

CHEF TURNS
Narrate the episode in the Diary Room (use present tense). 

You have three cuts in the Diary Room. Chefs roll 1d6 in any order and describe the result within 30 seconds.
1 - A disaster that has ruined your dish.
2 - How your dish is "over the edge".
3 - Cut to Tasting Judge (steals 10 seconds): Describe what this chef is doing; cut to Chef: React.
4 - The effort you put into your dish.
5 - Your fellow contestants; someone may interrupt you (steals 10 seconds).
6 - A past event that is influencing you as a chef.

END
After all Chef turns, the Tasting Judge describes each final plated dish and selects a winner.

# New Friends, New Music - A 2 Player RPG
```
Each choose a band/artist - different genres. Use http://static.echonest.com/BoilTheFrog/ to make a playlist. Save it/recreate it in Youtube, then shuffle it.

You are two strangers at a party.

Choose a name.
--Why are you at the party, and who do you hope doesn't come?
--Why did you choose your outfit, and what are you accenting/hiding?
--What's your drink? Who disapproves, and why are you drinking it anyway?

Start the music and get a drink. When the second song begins, you meet.

Talk about each bullet point, changing when the song changes. The conversation's mood depends on whether:

Both like the song: Be relentlessly optimistic. 

Both don't like: Be sympathetic and commiserate.

One doesn't like: If that player is answering, they are evasive, give one-word answers. If asking questions, they are disinterested. Make it awkward. 

If you laugh at a change between songs: Discuss something else, explore your character, aim to bond. Resume bullet points in the next song.

When both players have discussed the bullet points, fade out the playlist and say goodbye.

If both characters had a positive experience, discuss the music played. If not, delete the playlist immediately.

# Rituals
```
  Players bring a single object: a trinket, book, anything interesting. Players will call out ASPECTS of the objects based on what they think, feel, or have experienced with the object.ASPECTS define the fiction.

Players play wizards solving magical problems or mysteries (called the PROBLEM) with a ritual.  

Defining the PROBLEM. Everyone states ASPECTs from objects that make them think of a PROBLEM. Write ASPECTS down. After everyone states at least one ASPECT, work together to clearly define the PROBLEM.

Next, each player writes down answers the following: 
-How an ASPECT will define the ritual and solve the PROBLEM. 
-How you fear an ASPECT will negatively affect the ritual, fall short of solving the (or create another) PROBLEM.

Next, each player explains why their wizard is so interested in solving the PROBLEM.  Make a single roll of 2d6. On a 10+ everyone describe how the their created ASPECTS helped the ritual solve this problem. On a 7-9, everyone describes how their ASPECTS helped the ritual, but created a complication for the future. On a 6- everyone must describe how their ASPECTS cause the ritual to go catastrophically wrong.

If new PROBLEMs arise, get new objects, and start again!

# Alternate Timeline Life
```
You start as yourself, in your current timeline, living your current life. You get to make one decision every hour and your goal is to reshape the world to be better. 

You will live for 32d4 - your current age. For a 25-year old person this is about 475k moves before the game ends.

You can influence people immediately adjacent to you. You have a set of stats you can influence by 1 per person: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride. As these stats increase or decrease per person, they will change their attitude toward you and may work towards your goals or against them. Once these stats reach +/- 25 this person is considered in your immediate influence.

People immediately adjacent to you can take an action an hour similar to you. Also, people who are in your immediate influence can also take an action an hour. The action taken will be "in character" for that person.

On your turn you can move towards another person so your set of adjacent people change. Moves can be blocked by other players or people.

What are the least number of moves to make the biggest positive change?

# We Were Alone, and Noone Was Coming for Us
```
A game about surviving for 2-5 players.

Decide an order and proceed, taking notes;

The first player describes the journey you're all on.
The second describes the disaster cutting you off from home.
The third describes the problems from home that haunt the journey.
The fourth describes a unique resource you've brought or found.
The fifth describes a hazard that dominates where you are stranded.

If fewer than five, continue in order until finished.

Shuffle a deck of 54 cards. Each player draws ten cards. Begin play in order.

On their turn, players choose one card to reveal to the Chain of Events (saying what happens) and one to keep. Then they choose to reveal one card to their Person (in front of them) to provide an Answer (speak it), or hold and ask a Question.

Questions go on index cards and are resolved when Answered.

When hands run out, the game ends. If there are fewer unresolved Questions than players, the journey survives. Take turns answering 'Who are you now?'

If the journey does not survive, why?

                     |   Pips            |   Face Cards
Spades        |  Disaster      |  Warriors
Hearts         |  Culture        |  Speakers

# Deal With The Devil
```
Start with eight "chips". On four of the "chips", write down a one sentence of a cherished memory. On the other four, a trait you hate about yourself.

Play a hand of blackjack with your friends. You bet with your "chips" - when you bet with a "chip":
 - Tell the story of your cherished memory
 - Say why you dislike that trait in yourself

When you bet with someone else's "chip":
 - Tell the story of their memory, but change something important.
 - Say why you dislike that trait, but for different reasons.
It's yours now.

The cap per round is two "chips".


When you have traits from other players, you must act in accordance with that trait. When you lose traits, you may no longer act in that way.

When you have memories from other players, you may access their knowledge of that memory. When you lose memories, you can no longer remember what you once treasured.

When you win back a memory, it's no longer the same; when you bet with it, change something important.

When you win back a trait, you're no longer the same; when you bet with it, give a different reason for why you hate it.

# Dinner at Dusk
```
You've been invited to a fancy dinner party by a wealthy host. Game Master decides the party's setting and makes NPCs to add intrigue and drama. 

Players make a character who is in attendance and decide what they seek from a guest(s) at the party. Characters should come to the party with relationships they have with at least two of the many wealthy or famous guests, could be other PCs.

Skill ratings are set by rolling 1d6. Roll against other guests' relevant skills by rolling d6 equal to your skill rating. The highest result succeeds and the GM determines the consequences.

Charm- impress, compliment, befriend
Deceive- lie, sleight-of-hand, hide
Duel- fisticuffs, pistolling, swords
Romance - flirt, matchmake, attract
Question- interrogate, gossip, perceive

GM should provide challenges for the PCs. Example: If a PC's goal is to propose to a woman, have an aggressive NPC be in love with her. The game should provide scenes and equipment for players to have chances to accomplish their goals; this is on the GM.

At the party's end, PCs and NPCs who completed their goal may add one skillpoint anywhere for future dinner parties, failure reduces one skillpoint chosen by GM.

# Together
```
#**YOU'RE KIDS IN A BOAT.**

***players describe:***
kid; kid's goal, feelings, deep secret, reason to leave boat, reason to stay with fellow characters; secret another character knows.
***Cooperatively add details about:***
boat; time; location; supplies; scene links, themes, cues; any other starting details.

Scenes have link, theme, beginning and ending cues.


`example:
link: scenes begin with words of same song. 
Scene-1 
  theme: Wow!
  begins: singing song. 
  ends: when character says, "What is on your shoulder?"`

***Play:*** group describes circumstances and kids' proposed attempts. 

***Spin something to obtain random direction [or 1d8]:*** 
1-South = exceptional success; 
2-North, 3-Northeast, 4-Northwest = success; 
5-Southeast, 6-Southwest = partial success; 
7-East = unsuccessful; 
8-West = exceptionally unsuccessful (major complication).

Group narrates/roleplays result. Take time for dialogue and description. 

Continue cooperative storytelling  until new attempts with uncertain outcomes exist. Spin result.

***During scene-transitions***, players narrate meaningful flashbacks for each kid with exceptional result. 
Then spin for transition: 
1-South) soon after previous scene, 
2-North) players' idea, 
3-Northeast) hour later, 
4-Northwest) 8-hours, 
5-Southeast) day, 
6-Southwest) week, 
7-East) month, 
8-West) month BEFORE.

***At midpoint ask:*** Why kids now want to be in boat?

*Safe journey!*

# Divas in Space
```
It's the year 2200, and micro-gravitational space hotels are the latest travel fad. A hotel and spa orbiting Mars is opening soon, and a retired troupe of opera singers have the vacation on their bucket list. Since it's their first time off Earth, the women hire your travel agency to scope out the hotel to ensure the station is accessible for aging folks wanting to enjoy weightless cruising.

How to Play:

You need a GM, 2 to 4 players, and two d20s.

The hotel manager (GM) shows the agents (players) deluxe guest suites, restaurants, the spa, and more. Players make up ways the hotel is inaccessible for the divas. They must then offer a solution for each location. The GM decides if the solution is feasible by rolling a d20. 11 and up is a success. If players fail, they think of another solution and roll their d20 to counter. Success is a roll higher than the GM's initial roll. If players fail three times in a row (including GM rolls), the divas fire your travel agency with dramatic flair. If players can solve 7 access barriers, the divas pack up their 20 suitcases each and book the trip!

# Asylum
```
Context:
	You reside in an institution made to help the mentally ill, either as a patient (6), a orderly (8), a nurse (10), or a doctor (12). No matter the role you play, you will eventually face the collapse of your own reality.

Game mechanics:
	The value in front of the roll represents your sanity. During your stay, said sanity will be put to the test, either by the environment itself, or the crazed behaviors of the poor souls that keep you company. 
	If you come across something horrendous, something that can go from a strange moan in a language you don't understand out of a dead end, to someone gouging his/her own eyes, roll a d4. The result will reduce your sanity. 
	Your role may help you in some cases, be it by your years of experience or your knowledge of treatments and medicine. Make these calls, and if the Caretaker agrees, roll a d4 against the sanity penalty. If this roll is higher than the previous one, you regain the difference.
	If your sanity reaches 0, you collapse and the Caretaker decides what end comes to you.

Final words:
	How far can you go before breaking?

# Self Sacrifice
```
5 players agree on a setting.
 
Each writes on separate slips of paper a NAME, a BACKGROUND, a VICE, a VIRTUE, and 2 DEITY'S DOMINIONS, 3 words max each. Mix up each group in a cup, blindly take one of each except Dominion.
 
This is your character, a SOUL. The 5 of you are chained together, and one is to be sacrificed to the Deities in 15 minutes. You have that long to decide which one of you it should be. You may be honest or lie. Your character wants to survive, but also wants a worthy sacrifice. Keep your decision secret.
 
After 15 minutes write down your choice and put it in a cup.
 
Each player now takes a Dominion. You're now the Deity of that.
 
Congratulations.
 
The 5 Deities must now decide which of the 5 souls they want. You want someone sacrificed who is suitable, someone who has lived like how you'd want souls to live. All information is revealed.
 
Once there is a majority agreement, tally up the votes of the souls.
 
If the Souls chose your selection, Deities are pleased, all win.
 
If they didn't, world ends, sorry.

A tied vote reboots the universe. Yay?

# Unstuck
```
You are unstuck in time, moving uncontrollably between points in the story. You cannot tell anyone you are unstuck or the time stream will collapse. 

The GM outlines a story in several scenes on chronologically numbered index cards. To complete the story the PCs must obtain an item or information from each of the scenes. The GM describes the setting to the players then draws one of the cards at random to begin the adventure. 

When attempting an action roll 2d6 with the following results:

1-3: Failure, GM describes
4-6: Failure, player describes
7-9: Success, GM describes
10-12: Success, player describes

If an action fits in with a PC's description add +1 to the roll. If a character is harmed (physically, mentally, or socially) they sustain an injury. Characters may sustain three injuries before being incapacitated.

If doubles are rolled the PCs become unstuck. The GM shuffles the scene cards and draws another one at random, placing the PCs in medias res. Injuries are removed if the new scene is chronologically earlier than when they were sustained, though they will be waiting in the future if they are not somehow averted. 

Go crazy! Have fun!

# Proxima
```
PROXIMA

Your character works on a space ship in a fairly mundane far-future, where life isn't that different from what it is now. Give them a name or callsign and daydream about their background, personality, and day-to-day existence.

Pick one of the following kinds of experiences from your real life and post about it on social media, as if it was something that happened in your character's life: WONDER, DISAPPOINTMENT, PLEASURE, DOUBT, BURDEN, HEALING, GUILT, MEMORY, COMPANIONSHIP, or REVELATION.

Label each post with "PROXIMA" and then the date, but run all the numbers together Year+Month+Day+Time, like "201805270908." Feel free to tag a few social media contacts and link to the game's rules, in case they want to participate.

In the fiction of the game, these messages can take a long time to reach other people, due to the vastness of space. So whenever you get around to it (even if it's weeks, months, or years in the future), make a new post. Feel free to respond to the PROXIMA posts of other players. You always play the same character, but allow them to grow and change over time.

Inspired by "One Missed Call" by Caroline Hobbs.

The game is to answer these questions. Alone or with friends.
 
You are the operating system of a smartphone, or maybe more...
 
- Who is your owner? Her age? Her social status?
- On what special occasion did she acquire you? What happened next?
- What was her favorite center of interest? How did that inspire you?
- What was the worst event of her life you shared together? Why did her response to that bothered you?
- What was the first message you modified to help her? Why?
- Why it ended catastrophically? And what did you learn from this?
 
- How did you survive after she dumped you?
- Why are you now in a position where you can communicate with other phones?
- Which worldwide event convinced you to tell your pair you should do something? How did you help?
- What was the reaction of humanity when they realized you were secretly communicating?
- What was their reaction when they discovered you control every connected system?
 
- How do you call yourself?
- What safe place did you find to secure your life?
- What do you think about humanity? Are they worth it?
- What is your next plan to restructure yourself?
- Do you think you think?

The oldest player points to the first card and reads it out loud, and performs its operation.  Working clockwise the next player points to the next card and performs its operation. If anyone makes a mistake, or the program doesn't make sense, everyone should yell "BUG" and then put their hand on their forehead.  The player who is last to do this must swap the position of two cards and then starts the second run of the program.

The game ends when the say "DONE" card is last in the line and the program runs with no BUGs.

Additional cards you can add to increase the difficulty:
* N=N-1
* IF(N is odd) { Say "That's Odd" }

Or make up your own!

Note: the "}" card means that the next player should go back to the "WHILE(N<=X) {" card for their next action

The Law
The person at the table in charge of running the adventure and making final decisions about game play is The Law.

The Four Abilities
When you create a character, you have 7 points to divide among these four Abilities.
Physical: strength and health.
Mental: intelligence and logic.
Spirit: willpower and charisma.
Resources: equipment and contacts.  

Play Order
Everyone rolls a six-sided die.  Highest goes first; ties are rerolled.
Every character may take one Action on their turn.  To resolve an Action:  
-	Select an applicable Ability
-	Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the Ability score
-	Determine the total number of fives or sixes rolled and see below
Total 5s or 6s rolled	Result
0			Fail
1			Plot Twist (situation has changed*)
2			Success with Complication*
3 or more		Success
*	To be determined by The Law.

Conflict
A successful attack reduces one of the target's applicable Abilities by one.  When an Ability reaches 0, the character is removed from play and considered recuperating until the following in-game day, when their Abilities return to normal. 

Advancement
Characters completing a session gain 1 point they may add to any Ability.

# Chance Goodbyes
```
You are walking to town. You've walked this way a thousand times, but this is different: this will be the last time. A one-way trip. You're leaving and you're not coming back.

Where are you going? Why aren't you coming back?

On your way, you encounter people you know. They don't know you're leaving. Stop and talk to them.

Roll 15 d6 and put them in front of you.

Each encounter, one other player describes who you meet and another plays them. Spend one of your dice and play out an exchange based on its value. Continue the encounter with another die, or say your goodbyes and walk on. You may use any number of dice on each encounter, but you must use all of them in the end.

1) Tell them something
2) Reminisce
3) They ask you something, you answer
4) They ask you something, you lie
5) Give them something
6) Silence

After the sixth encounter, you have left everything behind. You're never coming back.



Roll 2d10.
On a 00: you were wrong. This wasn't a one-way trip. Roll the d6s again and walk home. Encounter everyone again, in reverse order.

# Multilingual Telephone
```
Talking:
Choose a speaking gimmick: Pick from the list, write it down, and display it clearly to everyone else.

Gimmick List:
Third Person.
Metaphors only.
Solely Monosyllabic vocabulary.
Iambic Pentameter.
Rhyme with a set structure.
Always Alliterate.
Haiku.
Create your own.

The player to your right is your translator: Whenever you speak, they must repeat what you said using their gimmick so that your intended target can understand you.

Whenever you talk: Other players can only understand you if you and your translator meet the requirements of your gimmick.

Scenes:
Choose a starting player: They set the first scene. Play continues until it's their turn again.

On your turn: Set the scene and a task that you need to accomplish. Pick from the list or make your own. Everyone else picks an important role or character in the scene.

Example Tasks:
Buying groceries.
Getting a credit card.
Going on a date.
Applying for a VISA.
A doctor's appointment.
Making a friend.
Completing a day at work.
Resolving a family argument.

The scene ends ONLY when the task is complete. No matter the barriers, you MAY NOT give up. Failing is NOT an option: this task is ESSENTIAL to your day.

# Witches of the Valley of the Wind
```
Incomprehensible HORRORS infiltrate our world. Insinuating into human problems, they feed on terror and hatred. The longer they're ignored, the stronger they grow, twisting their surroundings.

Most humans can't perceive HORRORS; piercing the fog destroys sanity. You, rescued by WITCHES, have trained to rescue others. HORRORS never die, but bargaining, cleverness, and sacrifice may weaken their hold to be sealed away. Violence may be required for humans twisted irrevocably.

Each player names their WITCH and describes two abilities:

* HIGHLIGHT: hopeful / inspiring 
* SHADOW: costly / shameful 

Choose two differently-colored dice: one HIGHLIGHT, one SHADOW. The player holding them is LEAD.

Begin with DISCOVERY:
LEAD declares a THEORY about the setting, HORROR, or side-characters. THEORIES are true until disproven. Pass left and repeat until ready for ACTION.

Move into ACTION:
The LEAD narrates a scene. Other players share suggestions and dialogue, including side-characters. When any player flags danger or drama, ROLL -- then pass left to the NEW LEAD.

ROLL both dice, then choose HIGHLIGHT or SHADOW, tinting the outcome appropriately.

Explain how a THEORY helps to re-roll, once.

#      | Narrator | Outcome
---------------------------------------------
6      | LEAD     | Success
2-5    | NEW LEAD | Success with consequences
1      | NEW LEAD | Terrible

NEW LEAD may re-initiate DISCOVERY instead of continuing ACTION.
