# Demonic Cupcake Failures
```
Ghosts have many reasons to haunt us. Forlorn love and revenge are poetic, but some ghosts just have unfinished mundane business. Such is the case with deceased bakers who haunt us in the hope of passing on lost recipes.  In this game, players are paranormal investigators on a reality show about contacting dead bakers and bringing them peace in the afterlife. 

Game requires:
Ouija board
Cupcake recipe

Play happens in six stages:

Players create a paranormal investigator persona.  One player is also the narrator who lays out a scenario. "Grandma's Bakery has been haunted for 30 years by a restless spirit!"
Players take turns expanding on the haunting. "I sense Grandma hated raisins. She burns any raisin cookies baked here."
Use the Ouija board to ask the ghost questions about their history and reason for haunting.  
Ask the ghost for two ingredients to complete the recipe. 
Acquire ingredients (if possible) and bake cupcakes.
Judge the cupcakes.

The success of the show is judged as follows:

Fantastic cupcakes! You contacted the ghost. The spirit can rest.
Terrible cupcakes. You contacted the wrong ghost. Try again!
Impossible cupcakes. You contacted a poltergeist. 
Poisonous cupcakes! You contacted a demon. DO NOT EAT.

# Michelin Star Panic
```
Players: 4+
Divide cards into four shuffled piles based on suit and a fifth with Aces, Royals, and Jokers.

The players are professional chefs. Take time to get to know one another. Assign each player a role.

Prep: Holds only one card. May give card freely to anyone. May draw from any deck.
Sous: Holds three cards. May give single cards to Preps or their entire hand to the Head.
Head: Holds five cards. Can only give single cards to Preps or Declare dishes complete. May Discard.
Client: Sets a culinary situation, including taste, quantity, and price preferences. Be cruel.

Hearts: Sweet
Diamond: Sour
Spade: Salty
Club: Bitter
Face: Savory

Players have 10 minutes. A dish is a poker hand. Higher numbers are more expensive. Aces high, Jokers low. When time is up, players converse about menu to the Client. If Client is satisfied, gain a Michelin star, Head is promoted to Client, and Client becomes a Prep. If Client is unsatisfied, lose a Michelin star and Head is demoted to Prep. A Sous is promoted to the new Head and chooses someone to replace him.

Endgame:
Victory: Three Stars.
Defeat: Fail to satisfy a Client with no stars left.

# Stratus Res
```
For two players

The two of you have found a moment of peace you have never known.
You rest in each others arms, eyes to the sky.
You hear the water, feel the sun, and smell the growth of new life all around.
You escaped your broken home together to get here, but this place too will be lost before long.

You take this time to tell a story.

Cut out a paper flower with six separate petals.
Begin with touch, whatever level you are comfortable with.
This will be sustained throughout your story.

Your story is about a past.
Not your past, but one much happier.
Free of choking smoke and ash.

Teller, begin the story however you like.

Listener, when the story strays too close to your true past, briefly embrace your partner more tightly.
Sit together in silence and decide for yourself what the true past was.
Then, Listener becomes Teller, picking up the story just before it was left off.

The past holds darkness; the future holds a white void of unknown.
When the story touches on the future, tear one petal off the flower.
When no petals remain, your story is over.

# Epics To Ashes
```
One of you is the Authority. Others are Soldiers. Soldiers announce, proudly, their loyalty to the Authority and why they're fighting.

The Authority will establish scenes, one after another, until one Soldier remains.

In scenes, the Authority plays all powerful figures. Players whose Soldiers are in the scene roleplay themselves. Players whose Soldiers are elsewhere or dead can whisper as whatever they feel fits: nature, the environment, faceless soldiers, enemies.

There will be a conflict, and the Authority will make it about two Soldiers. Both those Soldiers simultaneously write poems. These poems are four lines, in ABCB rhyme scheme. (Break these rules to taste, rarely and purposefully.) Non-poets may whisper, but only to each other.

The Authority will read both poems aloud, selecting one "victor" (usually but not necessarily the best poet). The losing Soldier dies; the Authority declares how.

The winning poem will be put in a safe place. The Authority chooses one word from the losing poem to be carefully cut out and preserved-- an epitaph. The rest of the losing poem is destroyed-- war kills poems. Rip it, cut it, sing it no requiems. If you have fire, turn it into ashes.

# Lost Souls
```
You died. How did you die? How do you feel about it? Did you have what they call "a good life"? What did you leave behind in the world, what trace of your very existence is there to be found? Do you have any unfinished business or did you manage to accomplish everything you ever wished for?

The players act as Lost Souls. The Souls create what is called an Assembly. The only way for the Souls to move on is to have other members of the Assembly agree to their fate.

Each player creates their own character with backstory leading to the moment of their death. Each player also picks their Agenda - whether they want to move to different plane, go back and reunite with their loved ones or get revenge on those who crossed them. Each player then gets to tell their story to the Assembly. Other Souls may freely ask their questions. By the end of the story, everyone decides whether they'll back the storyteller and allow them to pursue their goal. The game lasts until everyone tells their story - only then some lucky Souls move on, while other remain waiting for more Souls to arrive...

# Beat the Heat: a Hot Sauce RPG
```
###### Setup:

Grab three hot-sauces. Make sure that these are real hot, and order from least to most spicy. One person GMs, everyone else plays a character. Pretty standard stuff.


###### Character Creation:

Write your character down, and allocate one of the hot-sauces to each of the following stats (your best stat will have the least spicy):

	Physical. Anything that uses your body.

	Mental. Your ability to debate, lie, problem solve, etc.

	Spiritual. Your willpower (it's kinda like wisdom meets constitution). 

*(Note to GM: If you're unsure which skill applies in a situation, it's probably Spiritual)*


###### Conflict Resolution:

When you want to do something, the GM will determine how many spoons of sauce you must do (based on the difficulty). You must IRL do that many tablespoons of the sauce listed under the stat to succeed. If the conflict is between two players, go back-and-forth until someone gives up.


###### Health and Damage:

Everything deals equal damage. When you get hurt, do three spoons of your Spiritual sauce. You have one glass of milk, you are NOT allowed to refill it. You don't die when it runs out; you die when you can't handle it anymore.

```
<hr>

# Huddled. A 200 word RPG.
```
A domed city contains the last 5,000 humans on the planet. 

A catastrophe will soon end it all. Define it.

Each player answers three questions to define their character:
Why do you deserve to be here?
Why don't you deserve to be here?
How are you involved in the imminent catastrophe?

Introduction
Briefly describe how you all gathered together. What are you collectively hoping to achieve?

Scene One
The main obstacle to overcoming the catastrophe

Scene Two
Meeting the characters who will help/hinder - each player may define one or two NPCs.

Scene Three
Crisis Point: Challenging the obstacle.

Scene Four
Crisis Point: Who is the betrayer? Are the repenting or continuing? Who are they betraying you all to? What nature does the betrayal take?

Scene Five
Crisis Point: Saving humanity. Or not.

Players roll 9d6. 1-3 is a low point for a character. 4-6 is a high point. Each Crisis requires at least ten points to pass. Players must use three die at each Crisis. It may not be possible to "Win". Let us know how it all ends.
```
<hr>

# The Blind Leading
```
For 1 GM + 3-5 Players

You hear screams. People are dying. You live on the fifth floor of apartments for the impaired. You are blind. Escape.

Each player gets notecards. 4, 5, or 6. More = longer game.

Describe your character, write their name on the cards.

Give one to a trusted character, take one from a distrusted character. Shuffle your cards frequently, names ALWAYS hidden.

GM secretly chooses threat: Deaf horrors, hypnosis-induced homicidal rage, cultists, something else (get creative).

GM describes only what is remembered, heard, felt, smelled, or tasted.

Taking a difficult action makes a player "active"

When GM says "You'll need help", all other players must close their eyes and hold out their hands. The active player gives a card to another player, the assistant, who opens their eyes. The Assistant chooses: the given card OR a random card of theirs (returning the given card).

Show chosen notecard to GM without looking, GM will not let you choose an active player's card bearing your name, or a card of yours showing the active player's name.

Destroy the chosen card.

GM can take notecards without revealing names, if character is injured/traumatized.

No cards remaining = Character is killed

# Benjamin Franklin's Self Help Process
```
A low stakes game for two players. Each makes a realistic character who might know the other.

Franklin believed we can improve ourselves by focusing on a single virtue each week:

Temperance
Silence
Order
Resolution
Frugality
Industry
Sincerity
Justice 
Moderation
Cleanliness
Tranquillity 
Chastity
Humility

Each week has a goal- family, social, professional/school, spiritual, hobby, rest. Roll 1d6 or choose and narrate your character's life.
Each week choose one virtue- not necessarily from above- and try to improve your life along that axis despite life's challenges. 
Each week roll 1d6- 6 means you crush it, you narrate how something challenged you and you didn't give in. Five or four means the other person, playing the world, narrates a problem and you narrate the solution. Otherwise they narrate a problem and you narrate how you failed. 
Start with 1 point, each rolled success adds one, failures can be cancelled if you can tie the virtue you previously earned into reaching new goals. Cancelling 3s costs 1 point, cancelling 2s costs 2, cancelling 1s costs 3. 

Switch roles each week so both players get thirteen virtues. 

Once done you may start over because nobody alive is perfect.

# Fables and Folktales
```
We tell stories to explain and entertain. These stories are communal and change with the storytellers. Your job is to work together, tell a story, and build a bond. There is no failure, only growth.

Requirements:

3+ players
Pencil
Paper
1d6
A coin

Roll 1d6 to determine the type of story:

1- Explanation of world phenomena
2- Deity story
3- Trial of a hero
4- Creation story
5- World's end story
6- Trickster fable

Begin with the oldest player. Choose the setting and begin telling a story. Continue until a decision must be made by a character.

 Flip the coin: heads, the decision has a positive outcome and leads to creation or explanation. Tails, the decision has a negative outcome and leads to destruction or confusion. Write down the coin flip and then make the decision.

The next player continues the story until another decision must be made. Repeat above rules. 

Repeat for every player.

After each player has a decision made in the story, refer to the number of flipped coins.

 If more positive outcomes or negative outcomes were made, the beginning player ends the story with a positive ending or negative ending, respectively.

```

# Crumbling
```
Work starts at the bakery at 5am, three hours before it opens.

Describe your role there and your personal problem.
Together describe a problem customer, a problem supplier, a problem recipe, and a problem competitor.

The players take turns to call a scene at the bakery, one for each hour until an hour after it closes at 3pm.

To take an action when the results are dramatically important;

Drop either your compassion muffin or your wisdom muffin from shoulder height.
If it stays intact, you succeed.

Every piece that breaks off larger than your thumbnail is an unfortunate consequence.

Select one piece larger than your thumbnail to continue with. The smaller it is, the lesser your success.
Eat the rest.
Sweep away the crumbs.
Throw away what is left when you finish work.

When there are no pieces big enough, you may continue to take actions, but without wisdom and compassion there is only hardship.

You may only buy new muffins at the start of the day.

Play as many days of work as you can stomach dropped muffins.
```
<hr>

# Hunter/Hunted
```
You are being Hunted. There's no escape. You must survive long enough to stop the Hunter.

You have 3 attributes: Exhausted, Panicked, and Insane. These start at 1. Distribute 4 points between them to build tension. You have three advantages. Sacrifice an advantage to succeed at a related task.

The Hunter's Threat starts at 1. This number is secret. When you're not actively evading the Hunter, add 1d4. Outrun, outfight, or outsmart the Hunter to reduce it by 1d4. At 10+, someone dies. When someone dies, reduce it by 2d4.

To do something...
-cautious, roll above a relevant attribute on 1d10.
-desperate, increase the relevant attribute by 1 and roll equal or below.
-stupid but genre-appropriate, increase Threat by 1d4 and automatically succeed.

When you fail, something bad happens and an attribute goes up by 1. When one of your attributes is 10, you're toast. Narrate how your character dies.

To stop the Hunter, you must understand its capabilities (power source, special abilities, weaknesses), then exploit them.

To begin play, narrate the buildup of horror with the GM. Describe how some of your friends died and who the Hunter is stalking right now.

# Are you real?
```
Are you player or character? Are you calling the shots, or is someone else rolling for you?

This game is not played at a table but in real life. As you go through your day, ask yourself:
Am I interacting with players or NPCs?
What skill am I currently using?
Did my player roll well or not?
Do you feel they played out your actions, or did they skip ahead?

In the evening, take a couple of minutes to write down the day you had - from the perspective of your player.
Ask yourself why they made the choices they did - how do they want to develop you?
The best roll they had - like when they had you write a 200-word-RPG and rolled really well on their performance check.
Vice versa, their worst roll.
What class and archetype are you?
Did you level up?
And is this still backstory, or the adventure proper?

For a multiplayer experience, share these entries with your friends and discuss the dynamic of the group that plays you. Try to find out what their game master is like from what they throw at you.

The best part: you can play as long as you like!

# Guest of Honour
```
Today, you have all met for one reason: you await the arrival of the Guest who has been marked for death. You have a conversation while you wait. 

Everyone will have a turn to answer five questions in order, with discussion following from all players:

How did you meet the Guest?

What do you most associate with the Guest?

What was your most intimate moment with the Guest?

What happened the last time you saw them?

What's your secret?

Each turn, flip two coins: the tone coin shows positive or negative feelings and the truth coin will dictate whether you are answering truthfully or if you accept other's answers.

Each associate will start the game with five tokens. As each turn ends, you must give at least one token to anyone you feel brought the most to the table. At the start of each new question, add another two to your pile.

When the Guest arrives at the end of the questions, the player with the most tokens will perform one action, followed by everyone in order of tokens. If you kill another player, their turn goes next as their last act. 

When everyone has acted, end the scene together.

# A Kinder's Hide and Seek
```
Number of players: 2-10
Set a time limit on how long the game lasts.

One person asks, "Can we play Hide and Seek?"
That player picks someone and says, "You count."

Hiding players go hide in an obvious place. A player is hiding when there is no eye contact with the seeker and the seeker cannot see the hiding player's entire body-- covering your eyes behind a chair is a legal hiding place.

The seeker counts while barely covering their eyes. The count is to 10, or higher, depending how long it takes a hiding player to find a hiding place.

Those hiding usually giggle or make noises while the seeker loudly proclaims where they are looking. The seeker will look in places closer and closer to a hiding player, knocking on objects and saying, "where is [hiding player's name]? Are they [place they are looking]?"

Then, the seeker loudly 'finds' a hiding player by declaring, "There you are! I found you!" The seeker, and found players, continue seeking together until all hiders are found.

When all hiders are found a new person can become the new seeker, if everyone agrees.

# Sotry's End
```
Play as you read. Don't read ahead.

For too long, the dragon has terrorized your village. Name your village.

Think on the people who have died, and on those you must still protect. Name them all.

You have come to the entrance of its cave to slay it.

Describe your weapon. Place a D6 in front of you.

Ready yourself for battle.

The dragon must die. This ends here.

Everything ends here, in fact.

When you kill that dragon, this story ends. This world simply ceases to be.

Every life you've saved dissolves into the static of your memory.

And, in time, memories fade.

Maybe you'll hear a joke, or have a rough commute, and this world will drift into nothingness.

You could walk away though, leaving that dice on the table to remind you of the world you let live, in peril but alive.

Choose now. Stop reading and walk away, or keep reading and enter the cave.
















I suppose I knew you'd make this choice.

Roll the D6. That's how many hits it takes to kill the dragon. Picture them.

You did it. You killed the dragon. You saved the village.

I hope you had fun.

The end.

# Knights and their Lances
```
A game for two players.

You two are rival knights competing in a joust tournament for the honor and hand of the most esteemed Princess Roswyn of Courtesa. Secretly, one of you wants your rival knight more. Regardless, you have three jousts to do this.

Setup
Knights, please pick one descriptor for you and one for your rival: Large, Lovely, Weathered, Chiseled, Handsome, Athletic, Slim, Fair, Stout, Wild, Cute, Plain, Old, Stylish

Knights, one describes the princess and their token. The other secretly wants their rival knight. Choose now.

Before the first joust, it is custom to trot by the Princess' seat, boast and request her favor. What do you say to Princess Roswyn? What will you promise during the joust for their hand? 

Rock-Paper-Scissors best of two for who wins the Princess' token.

Play
You will joust three times. Knights may not speak to one another directly during the joust. Take turns describing how the other takes your lance. Innuendo is encouraged. It's ok to laugh or facepalm as players.

Resolve
Reflect: Have you won the heart of your rival? Have you won the heart of the Princess?
```
<hr>

# Bodies
```
Arvok is an old man possesed by demons. And he is dying, so they need to find new hosts. Each player chooses one demon: Leg Arm (controls it), Right Arm (controls it), Body (controls rest of the body: legs, head, torso,breathing and bowels), Voice (controls mouth and talking).

To do anything, roll 2d6: +10 = success, 7-9 = success with a cost, 6 or less = failure and bad things. Against each other, compare rolls.

Arvok (GM) will try telling others he is possessed. And to kill himself. You can't allow him (you lose). And you must find new bodies, but there are problems:

Only one demon passes to a new host (and gains control of it)
When a demon leaves Arvok, their corresponding body part is freed (making it harder to control him)
When only one demon remains on Arvok's body, he will die (and the demon is lost forever)

To possess a person/animal: Arvok needs to capture and inmobilize them. Then, only one of you can pass, the one that succeeds at:
Left or Right Arm: Reaching into their heart
Body: Making them kiss your feet or drink your blood
Voice: Convincing them to let you in 
```
<hr>

# Kami Kami
```
Everyone creates a spirit inspired by an animal or a natural element. Write a name, a parodistic description, a domain: you bring fortune or misfortune to this domain, choose it or find out playing, don't say it to the other players.

Choose a first player. Every scene starts in the same small medieval Japanese village. First player describes how his spirit enters the village and how he shows itself to the inhabitants or what he is doing something when they find him.
Every other player clockwise: first tells how children react, second how women react, third how men react. Inhabitants players can describe elements of the village. Spirit describe how he reacts to human reaction. Go reaction by reaction, until the scene ends.

The Spirit, or the first player not playing inhabitants, can end the scene. Cut the scene when you have a custom.

Who ended the scene write a statement on the "Tradition Paper": spirit name, one thing done by the one of the three inhabitants categories, the spirit write how change on his domains, "When Kazuiaku arrived, children hid themselves under the woman skirt. Rice production was generous". 
Game ends when every spirit have played a scene.

# Get Home Cool
```
1 player, 1 actual MRI machine

You made first contact with Humanity, dude! Totally by accident, but it counts! Guidelines say you have to play it cool around native species, and you did. They didn't ask too many questions, you didn't give too many answers, and now you're good to hop back in your ship and get out.

You don't know much about piloting one of these (I mean, you CRASH-LANDED here), but don't let the humans know that. Just slip into your Myelin-Reactive Intercraft machine and prepare to look cool as shit for those apes watching from the other room.

1) Don't move your body much. This baby is 100% psychic-controlled (The humans are gonna have their minds BLOWN!).

2) Try to anticipate when a pattern of noises will stop and when a new one will begin (Expert pilots can even predict patterns. No worries if YOU can't yet; THEY don't need to know that!).

3) Listen for when your psychic activity begins influencing the patterns, subtly changing the sounds. That means it's working (And the humans will be SO IMPRESSED)!

4) Picture home. Getting there will be a breeze.

Enjoy the end of your first impression!

# Dawn in Koromel
```
Your suffering is an empty bowl. 

Your determination is a second bowl, also empty.

Your life is ten pebbles.

The power of the Keepers is one card from a shuffled deck, face down.

Koromel is your home. The Keepers have controlled you for years. 

When you are ready, choose one:

  [ ] Describe Koromel.
  [ ] Describe the Keepers.
  [ ] Describe how the Keepers mistreated you.

After you finish speaking, put one pebble into your suffering. Let others speak before speaking again. Listen and build on what others say. Stop at ten pebbles.

Choose one below or let others choose. Keep going until the story ends.

  [ ] Describe what you learned or saved, and take one pebble from your suffering.
  [ ] Tell how you united the group or sacrificed yourself, and put one pebble from your hand into your determination.
  [ ] Tell how the group confronted the Keepers, and turn over the card that represents the Keepers' power. Face cards count as 11.
       [ ] If your determination is greater than the Keepers' power, tell how you triumphed.
       [ ] If the Keepers' power is greater, tell how the Keepers defeated you.
       [ ] If your determination is equal to the Keepers' power, end the story in an ambiguous, surprising way.

# Market Magic
```
A window shopping RPG for 3+ players
 
You are apprentices to a powerful, picky magician. Each of you hopes to present them with an unusual magic item, earning their favor. Name the magician, and each suggest a word or phrase describing their tastes. These insights into your choosy employer will guide and restrict your search.
 
Gather in an eclectic shopping venue, either physical (thrift store, antique shop, flea market, farmers market) or digital (craigslist, Etsy, eBay). Set a time limit and meeting place, then disperse on your arcane search for the perfect gift.
 
Return to the group to share pictures of your magic items. Describe how you hope your item's power and form will appeal to the magician. Voice comments, questions, and concerns about the other apprentices' items. Build on each other's descriptions to expand your shared vision of your employer, and of your relationships as apprentices.
 
Vote for your favorite item (besides your own) by pointing to its finder. Multiple winners are allowed. Losers describe how their items malfunction or backfire when the magician uses them. Winners describe a secret additional power of their item, which delights the magician.
```
<hr>

# Don't Split Up
```
 You will need: A piece of paper and pen; a six sided dice and 3-8 friends. 

 You and your friends are exploring an abandoned place. It could be a house, spooky woods etc.  Draw inspiration from your favorite scary movies. Talk about why your group is there and then pass the paper around, each writing a possible way to die. 7-10 should be enough. 

Now pretend that you are walking around in this place, take turns to describe atmosphere, what you are doing, and have in-character conversations. After about 5 minutes, each of you will roll the die, the lowest roller's character will split from the group. If there is a tie and you have a group larger than 4, both people will separate together, otherwise roll to break the tie. The lowest roller(s) decide why they split off and the rest of the group will use an item (or two) from the list to describe how they meet their doom. The doomed player is of course welcome to negotiate what that actually looks like. Repeat this process until only one of you is left. That person describes how they make it to safety.

```
<hr>

# Trinity Dice
```
In this system, there are three dice; d10, d6, and d4. Each die will be attached to a stat: DEXTERITY, (range combat, dodging, stealth) MIGHT (close combat, lifting/moving, blocking), and SOUL (magic, skills, interaction). Enemies will run on the same set of stats. 

If a player rolls the highest number they critically succeed (bonus effect on the action they performed), 9-4 (d10), 5-3 (d6), and 3 (d4) are normal successes, and anything lower is a failure.

Players can have up to three weapons/shields/magic attacks.

There are three weapon types, heavy (has 8 damage, and a 1 turn cooldown), medium (has 4 damage), and light (has 2 damage, uses DEX). Weapons can have bonus effects, such as enemies receiving -2 on dex rolls. Shields will reduce damage from enemy attacks when blocking.

Magic has three types, support (usable on players), singular target, and multi-targeting (hits anything in its path). Using magic requires mana, your energy count is determined by DEX + 2. Each magic attack has a Mana cost. Each spell's Mana cost is decided by the GM.

Health is determined by MIGHT + SOUL, x2 for players, multiplier for NPC's range from 0-10.
```
<hr>

# Convergence
```
You accidentally discover a way to send messages to the past, which you realize later altered the future - in a terrible way. Will you repair that mistake, or fail and end up in a foreign timeline? And what will you sacrifice on the journey?
Determine as a group what is wrong. Maybe you attracted undue attention, suffered a loss, or started a war.
Take three dice showing the sequence '521'. The sequence indicates your current timeline coordinates. Your original timeline is '111'. 
Taking turns, you send a message up to two weeks back in time. Describe the message, add 1 to one of the die, and subtract 1 from another (adding 1 to a 6 brings you back to 1 and vice versa). Roll the remaining die. This is your new timeline.
The player on your left describes an unintended consequence, the player on your right something unchanged in the new timeline. You describe a positive change.
In timelines with identical coordinates (e.g. '222') the time-messaging device is destroyed.
The game ends when you reach timeline '111' or when the device is destroyed. Each player narrates their new life, what they gained, and what they lost in parallel timelines.
```
<hr>

# Honorable One
```
The players are honorable creatures of the realm. They fight evil and corruption in whatever form. 

The GM will start by writing the first aspect of the realm. Then, each player writes one more. These aspects are true and are what makes the realm a dangerous place.

The creatures have one attribute. Honor. It starts at 5. It's maximum is 10. It's minimum is 1. 

Everytime there's conflict or something to overcome, the player(s) roll percentage. Look at the result of the d10. If the result is above his honor, it's a success. Raise honor by one. On a 10, raise it by two. If the result is below his honor, it's a failure. Lower honor by one. On a 1, lower it by two. If a creature's honor reaches 1 they are taken by the corruption of the realm. 

If the percentage result is a 1, the creature is instantly corrupted, but if it is a 100, his action creates an aspect in the realm. It can be whatever the player wants. An aspect should negate another aspect, but it can´t negate more than one.

The adventure ends when there's only one aspect.

# The Crucible Consumes
```
A three-player game.

You stand at the threshold.
You prepared for this, but cannot predict all that lies ahead.

Player1: What looms before you? (A warlock's tower / A cold steel arcology / An impenetrable fortress)
Player2: What must you do here? (Rescue them / Procure the artefact / Raze the inner sanctum)
Player3: Why are you prepared to die here today?

This is the point of no return.

=============
Setup
=============
Place a d4 ("the CLOCK") in the center, showing 3.
Each player gets 3 tokens.

=============
On your turn
=============
Narrate until a challenge/obstacle is encountered.

The player to your left ("L") describes our hero's approach.

The player to your right ("R") expends tokens to decide the outcome:
- Burn two: Success
- Burn one: Marginal success
- Burn none: Failure
- Gain one: Bitter failure

You narrate the result:
- Failure:
    - Sinking deeper...
    - The CLOCK ticks down. Drops below 1? **Game over!**  You: Describe how our hero is consumed.
                                                             R: What is their final thought?
                                                             L: Who will remember them?
- Success:
    - Hope glimmers...

# Has This Ever Happened To You?

THE FOLLOWING IS A PAID ADVERTISEMENT:

Life is filled with challenges: opening jars; robbing banks; thwarting mole-men uprisings, that could be just a little easier. Thankfully our OPERATORS are standing by.

Before the game, each OPERATOR takes an index card and writes down the following traits of the PRODUCT they're pitching. PRODUCTS can be: gadgets; services; exercise regimens, anything you'd see advertised on an infomercial.

 -------------------------------------
PRODUCT NAME:

THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY... 
What is the ostensibly normal use for the PRODUCT.

IT CAN EVEN...
What over the top, unnecessary thing can the PRODUCT do? (Work underwater, tow a tractor-trailer, even get out bloodstains!)

BUT WAIT...
Leave blank. Anytime during play, add a single feature to expand the use of your PRODUCT.

THERE'S MORE!
What useless bonus comes prepackaged with the PRODUCT? (Leather carrying case, meat thermometer, lifetime guarantee) 
 -------------------------------------

Then the CONSUMER presents the tribulations of their life. The CONSUMER is woefully incapable of living.

OPERATORS pitch how their PRODUCT would help solve the problem. What leg-up is there over the competition? Showmanship sells! Continue with the CONSUMER elaborating with additional needs they require fulfilled. When satisfied, the CONSUMER selects a PRODUCT to purchase.

Just pay Shipping & Handling.
