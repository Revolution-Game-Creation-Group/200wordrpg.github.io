# The Builder
```
Premise:
A new construction project has begun, perhaps a family building their dream home, or a new spaceship.

By the end of this game you will have a better appreciation for the strained relationship between tradespeople and their customers.

Materials:

-Index cards
-A Lego set with enough Minifigs to cover the players count

Preparation:

-Give each player an index card
-Pour all the Lego out on to the table*
-Decide between you what the construction project will be
-Assign a minifig to each player who then names it

Proceedings:

Use Chwazi or another suitable method** to select the first "Builder". 
The Builder chooses another player to assume the role of The Customer and opens a dialogue about their requirements. 
Once The Builder is happy that the requirement is understood she takes 10 bricks and starts or continues constructing that feature.

The Customer now becomes The Builder and play continues until everyone agrees that the project is finished. 
You are free to discuss how well your requirements were met and whether you believe you had realistic expectations. 
Also feel free to make Origami animals from your index cards at any point.

*You will also require a table
**There aren't any

# Each Player Brings Something
```
An object you have mixed feelings about. Something you could stand to lose but feels hard to let go of. Put it on the table before you. You won't have to reveal what it means to you.

Ask someone, about your own object: "Who does this belong to?" They'll improvise, whatever comes to mind. Now ask someone else. Both answers have some truth in them, but neither is entirely right. Synthesize: tell the group the right story.

Repeat until everyone's done this.

Go around again reconciling two stories, this time with the question "Who gave this to them?" And finally: "Why does it make them sad?"

Now close your eyes and hold your object. Think of its new story, but also the real truth behind it. Hold both in your head. There's some truth in each, but neither is entirely right. 

Decide whether you want to keep the object, or let it go.

When everyone's opened their eyes, don't speak. One by one either put your object back in your bag or pocket, or give it up: destroy it (if you can safely do so) or give it to someone else, who should never let you see it again.

# The unBEElievable rpg
```
It has been a harsh summer; wildfires have spread throughout the field of flowers.  
Your hive has not been able to collect enough pollen to make it through the winter. 
Your queen is anxious, worried about the drones. 
You are a honey stealer; you must go to the neighboring Hives and try to bring back honey so your hive will survive. 
Their queens are very susceptible to flattery.
You may pay their queen 1 compliment and when she is distracted you can try to steal a comb of honey. 
Roll 1D6, if it does not land on a 1 you are victorious and collect a comb of honey for your hive.  
Now, you may wish to fly straight home to the hive or.... double down. If you give the queen another compliment about her looks or hive you may now roll 2D6 for a second chance at a comb. But if you roll a 1 on either die you get nothing and have to report your failure to your queen. 
You may do this 6 times, 1 for each leg but if you roll a 1 on any increasing die, you get nothing.

# We will be together till the end
```
- The players´s characters are dying (disease, poisoning, wounds, curse...)

- Any scenario or setting is allowed

- A 5 or 6 results in a success of that Challenge, thus the player can narrate what happens next

- One character can help during another character Challenge roll by sacrificing a die to give +1 bonus value to that roll. Both narrate the outcome of the Challenge if succeded

- A character dies when her Last Efforts dices are over

- The objective is to try to fulfill the group´s Ambitions before dying

# The Post It Bearer
```
You are part of the fantastic world of Danora, where the newly discovered ancestral trees changed everything that was believed. Its leaves, called Post It, are nourished by a magical essence that gives rise to this glorious living being extraordinary abilities as intense as the age of the leaf in question. These are activated with an old spell and until today nobody managed to retain the power of more than three of these.

RULES: Draw your character on a paper and glue up to three Post Its where your valuable assets will be positioned, only 1 of these will be blessed initially by the essence of a "young" leaf of the ancestral trees. Roll a D6 for each item drawn on the Post It and half the result rounded up is the bonus the item provides through the rolls to which it can be applied interpretively.

The average difficulty for any test is 4 on a D6, which may increase or decrease depending on the complexity. In a match the character can hold up to three hits, translated as conditions, when this happens he becomes unconscious and if he does't have an immediate treatment the fourth condition will kill him.

# Upright - a Paleolithic RPG
```
You are Homo Erectus - upright man. Gather round the fire and share the tales of your tribe.

Gameplay takes place in scenes. Each scene one player takes a turn as the storyteller - they set the
scene, decide what the tribe must achieve and determine any required tests and their outcomes. At
the end of their scene, the storyteller rejoins the tribe.

Players have four stats rated 1 to 4: Head for thinking, Body for power, Hands for manipulating, Legs
for moving. Divide 10 stat points amongst them.

Test to do anything harder than walking, talking or eating. Roll under your rating on 1d6 to succeed.
If you fail a test, lose a point of the tested ability. Points refresh fully at the end of a scene.

Communication between players is strictly restricted to spoken one syllable words, gesturing and
drawing pictures. If you breach this rule, lose a point of Head. If Head is reduced to nil, you may no
longer talk but only grunt, gesture and draw. The storyteller has no communication restrictions.

Storyteller ideas

1: We need Fire
2: Hunting a Beast
3: Migrating home
4: War with neighbours
5: Chief is dead
6: Crossing the sea

# Full Circle
```
A game for four players.

Get some cards. Label 5 "Neophyte," "Battlescarred," "Eldest," "Darkness," and "The World." Put The World in the middle. Distribute the remaining roles. Each player writes one detail for the World, then each player takes turns writing details about their role until each role has three. 

The Darkness sets a machination in motion. Describe how you will change one of the world's details for the worse. If no-one steps up, the change happens. Erase and replace the old detail.

If someone steps up to Challenge The Darkness, it takes a toll. The Challenger says how they strike a blow that changes one detail of The Darkness or The World, and The Darkness responds with one change of the Challenger's details for the worse. After both players negotiate and agree, the Challenger and Darkness erase and replace their chosen detail. Otherwise the Challenger must back down after one minute's negotiation. 

Resolve three machinations, then change your roles. The Eldest succumbs. Destroy their card and give them the Darkness role. Erase and replace the word "Battlescarred" with "Eldest." "Neophyte" becomes "Battlescarred." The cardless ex-Darkness player creates a new Neophyte. Play until each player has played The Darkness once.

# Retail
```
Welcome to new employee orientation at [INSERT FICTIONAL STORE NAME HERE]. Before we begin, please write down your name on the provided name tags and introduce yourself to the group. First say your full name, your age, how long you've worked here, and what you would eventually like to do instead of working here. Players may optionally choose to be friends, enemies, family, acquaintances, or none of the above. 

Once you've all been acquainted, choose a player to go first. When it's your turn, choose a scene below and flip a coin. The coin flip determines whether it's a good (heads) or bad (tails) outcome for you. Anyone may contribute, but they act as supporting characters to the current player's conflict. 

-	Someone took something off the shelf and put it into their pocket. 
-	An ex of yours notices you and starts walking over to you. 
-	The boss calls you in for a "conversation." 
-	Something is malfunctioning in the store. Fix it. 
-	Weird customer at register. 
-	Angry customer at customer service. 
-	Coworker no one likes provokes you.

Continue until everyone has gone once. Then, everyone flips a coin to determine how their day ends. Narrate appropriately.

# A Perilous Journey... with raptors
```
Each year when young Raptorkin come of age they journey from their sweltering jungle village to the volcanic ice-peaks of Dragon's Maw, bringing back shards of purest obsidian to prove themselves.

Everyone plays as one adolescent Raptorkin:
- Rek'Na, teethmonger's daughter.
- Oosa, albino acolyte.
- N'nek, feathered crest.
- Raaljin, knife-dancer's son.
- Latu, feral child.
- Orn and Ira, twins.
- Yatt, iron-scaled giant.

The group begins with 2 Supplies per player. Every Raptorkin begins with 6 Morale.

Everyone takes 3 index cards. Name a dangerous or beautiful location on each. Shuffle them together then line them up, face down. Add the Raptorkin's Village and Dragon's Maw, face up, to opposite ends of the line.

Begin at the village. Discus what happens at each location. When everyone is ready to move on, flip the next card and continue your journey.

When a Raptorkin takes dramatic or dangerous action roll 1d10 vs their Morale.
- Roll lower: Success!
- Roll equal: Success, and gain 1 Morale.
- Roll higher: The group decides how the situation gets worse, or, they succeed but it costs 1 Morale or Supplies. 

If a Raptorkin's Morale hits zero, they reset to 6 Morale but now bear a secret shame. What is it?

```
one player is the WRITER and one the ARTIST. the writer names the HERO and the artist makes an ILLUSTRATION of them. name the SERIES and put the hero's name and illustration in the SERIES BIBLE. the writer can name anything that the artist introduced. if they do, the artist illustrates it and adds it to the series bible.

the artist draws a cover for the ISSUE, rolls a die, and gives both of them to the writer. the writer rolls another die and writes a passage:

if they roll higher, they must reveal someone's FEELINGS. 
if lower, they must increase the TENSION or raise the STAKES. 
if they roll the same, they may begin a new scene.

the writer sends their passage and die roll to the artist, who re-rolls their die and draws a picture: 

if they roll higher, they must show something PERILOUS. 
if lower, they must show the hero's REACTION. 
if they roll the same, they may introduce a new element into the scene or depict a flashback or vision. 

they send their picture and the die roll to the writer, and this repeats until both choose to end the issue and share with friends.

# Barbarians of the High Mountain
```
You are barbarians! Raid enemy holdings for the glory of your clan.

  -Characters-
Describe your character. The GM uses the description to determine your strengths
and weaknesses. Strengths subtract a level of difficulty for checks that involve
them, weaknesses add a level.

As barbarians, you each start with a bone mace(-1 attack difficulty) and natural
toughness(+1 opponent attack difficulty). Additional items may be acquired 
throughout play.

  -Difficulty-
The GM determines the difficulty of an action. Difficulty ranges from effortless(-3)
to arduous(+3). Outside this range automatically succeeds or fails.

Average(0) is a d6 roll. For each difficulty-level outside average, roll another d6.
Above normal, take the lowest. Below normal, take the highest. Rolls succeed on 4 or
higher.

  -Combat-
Each turn you can attack and move up to 30'. Target a body-part at +1 difficulty or 
select randomly, then roll to hit.

2d6
2.......Head
3-4.....Left-Leg
5.......Left-Arm
6-8.....Torso
9.......Right-Arm
10-11...Right-Leg
12......Head

Body-parts become mutilated at 4 injuries. Each injury adds difficulty for that 
body-part (-5' movement for legs). When the torso or head are
mutilated, you are slain. A body-part suffers two injuries on a 6.

# Why Can't My Hippo Fly Too?
```
~6 players-ish

Gather zoo animal figures and one human figure (total figures = # of players), as many D6s as there are players, half as many D4s, and one D20 (for the human).

Every player takes one random figure and one random die. 

The animals smell danger. If they don't escape, they will die.
The more animals that leave the zoo, the more the human zookeeper will be punished. Even dead, they must stay.

The animals roll their die. The number rolled is the number of verbs they can use to try and escape. Be realistic for your species. 

The human rolls their D20, plus all the leftover dice. Their total number represents the number of verbs they can use to prevent the animals from escaping. Their verbs may involve using tools--anything a human can do.

Starting with the animals, they explain one verb they each want to use. Then, the human may use as many verbs as they want in response (up to their maximum). The turn then passes back to the animals to pick their next course of action. Once you're out of verbs, you may no longer speak.

...What do you mean "this isn't fair"?

# Measurable Acts of Kinesthesia
```
Players. 8-800.
Materials. Notepads; writing instruments; closed-toe shoes (for safety); coin-toss app.
Role determination. Half of players are Performers and half are Observers. Selection is determined using coin/app. Players may exchange roles if desired. Players with physical handicap(s) are automatically Observers, but may be Performers if desired and are capable.
Functions. Observers create an action to fulfilled by Performers. Performers fulfill Observers' action and are measured by Observers via a rubric.
Setup. Observers design/define in writing a measurable, kinesthetic action. A rubric with at least one criteria is created to identify minimum requirements to pass an observation. Actions should be culturally relevant. Meanwhile, Performers prepare mentally and physically.
Gameplay. The kinesthetic action is announced. The game occurs in "rounds" of attempts by Performers. Performers who do not pass do not proceed to the next round. Each round requires pairing the remaining Performer with a new Observer to reduce bias.
Completion. The ending occurs when 25% of the original Performers have continuously completed the action, reaching its ideal form. If in an individual round no Performers pass the action, the game ends. Notes/scores should be fully shared to promote transparent observational research.

# Bronze Temple: The Game of Pyrrhic Attrition
```
The Empire is invading and violating the holy sanctity of the worship at the Bronze Temple. The characters, or Defenders, might not be of the faithful - they may be foreign allies - but they definitely all need the Empire's conquest of the known world to be slowed or stopped. 

PLAYERS: 3-6. One person is the GAME MASTER.

A CHALLENGE is a whole scene of CONFLICT, represented by one ROLL, always a D10. Every CHALLENGE is either to a single character's HUMANITY, or RATIONALITY, which is an attribute rated between 2 and 8; a character begins play with 10 points to split into these. On a loss, the character loses a point, or the STAKES, or a TAG. 

STAKES are a narrative resource, described by the GM as the reason for standing and defending at a particular battle. 

TAGS are Values, Possessions, and Relationships held by a character, who starts with 10. These illustrate the identity of the character, and a note card kept by the Player should have a descriptive sentence attaching personal meaning to each. 

CONFLICT scenes alternate with REST scenes in which the next STAKES are chosen.
```

# Wish You Were Here
```
Two players and a facilitator sit in different remote locations. You must communicate via video recordings. The video must not be live. You can't have live video when one person is on Earth and the other is on Europa.

Character A and Character B met on the dating website Constellation which connects people who specifically want a relationship with someone planets away. The facilitator works for Constellation and is conducting an end of relationship interview. This is required for A's subscription to Constellation to be terminated. Speaking without Constellation is impossible.
 
Characters A and B take turns sending videos in a group chat answering the facilitator's questions. A is on Earth, B on Europa. They've been together for three years.

Here are questions for the facilitator to ask via text in the chat. Ask others as you see fit. The more invasive and painful, the better.

A, why do you wish to terminate your subscription?

B, why are you keeping your subscription?

To both:

Why did you decide to use Constellation initially?

When did you know you wanted the relationship to end?

Are you really okay with never speaking to each other again?

The facilitator ends the interview when appropriate.

# Brotherhood
```
Gather pencils; paper; 1d4; 4 players; tokens.

One player is The Brotherhood (TB).
Everybody else plays aspects of The Dude (TD):
   _____________________________________
  | PLAYER |VIRTUE        |VICE         |
  |_____________________________________|
  | 1      |Courage       |Empathy      |
  |_____________________________________|
  | 2      |Loyalty       |Independence |
  |_____________________________________|
  | 3      |Assertiveness |Rebellion    |
   _____________________________________

Everybody answers:

What's TB about? Army, college, sport, religion, politics...

Why does TD want to belong to TB?

 _________________________________________________________
|      |         |  ...TB require members to do?          |
|      | ...does |________________________________________|  
| What |         |  ...make TD uncomfortable about TB?    |
|      |__________________________________________________|  
|      | ...secret would get him banished?                |
 _________________________________________________________


TD acts upon his virtues. Otherwise, he risks banishment.

TB player: use the answers to frame 4 scenes.
Look for conflict; then ask: "What do you do?"

TD players: narrate together what TD does/thinks/says. 
Resolve a conflict: use either your virtue or vice.

Roll 1d4:

    you win, 
        1-and you hide your vice if used.
        2-but you expose vices if used. Take 1-token for each.
    
    you lose, 
        3-and you fail your virtues. Take 3-tokens.
        4-but you can blame someone else. Discard 3-tokens if you do, or take 3.

Narrate the outcome together.

End of game with 4+ tokens: you're banished; otherwise you retain your position. You can discard all your tokens, but another dude is banished instead of you. 

TB narrates consequences.

# Mission:  Assemblage
```
NUMBER OF PLAYERS:  
Two or more, though ideally played with larger groups.

PREPARATION:  
-Write down one way you would like to change the world for the better.

GAMEPLAY:
-Choose a color for your thinking process.  If group is small, rank colors in order of preference as you may have to play more than one role.

WHITE:  will provide facts 
YELLOW:  will be optimistic
BLACK:  will be judgmental
RED:  will express feelings
GREEN:  will express possibilities and alternatives

-Draw polygon of three to ten three-inch long sides such that player's shapes can align edge to edge. Color your polygon with chosen color.

-Find others with whom to form an assemblage.  Ideally, this group will have at least six members but could be as small as two.

-Create a tangram-like assemblage with your polygons.  This will become your logo.

-Player one shares their desire to change the world, after which other players engage in thinking process based on chosen color.  Each color should have a voice if possible. Player one takes notes, revising tangram if desired. Rotate through whole group.

-Group debates which idea is best to adopt as its mission.

-Group works together to carry out its mission.

# Toil
```
Everyone has three characteristics:

Physical

# Half-Blood
```
You are all half-bloods, lowest among the Fae Court. 

As a fae, you possess:
- Mastery, a supernatural ability which always succeeds. Choose yours, unique among the Court.
- Compulsions, unnatural needs of Fae heritage. At game start, each other player assigns you one.

Once you use Mastery, GM chooses which Compulsion you must satisfy before you can use your Mastery again.

As a mortal, you have:
- 3 mundane skills;
- Free Will. Begin with 2; maximum of 5.

You exert will by spending it:
1: Overcome mundane conflict using skills
2: Overcome superhuman conflict using skills
3: Overcome a Compulsion permanently, erasing it
4: Choose to gain an additional Mastery.

To gain Will:
1: Satisfy a Compulsion
2: Gain a new Compulsion assigned by GM 

Your group has a mission. Describe it together and pick 3 Goals that must be satisfied before your return to the Court. GM presents appropriate opposition.

If you complete your mission and present yourself at Court, choose:

- If you have Will remaining, you may become wholly mortal. Lose your Masteries and Compulsions in exchange for freedom from the Court.
- You may submit to your nature and join the ranks of the Court as a full blooded Fae.

# Nutty Racers
```
On your marks, set, GO! You play racers in a nutty cartoon where there are no rules, and all types of racers enter. Drivers, runners, pop singers, etc. enter to see who's best.

Choose your racetrack (usually a game board.)

Write your character's name on a piece of paper. Secretly write a word on the back. This word is your Gimmick and it's how you advance in the race.

On you turn, you have 20 seconds to describe your outrageous way of moving up through the pack. Secretly keep track of the number of times you say your Gimmick. Move forward that number of spaces at the end of your turn.

Pay attention on other players' turns though. Keep track of the number of times they say your Gimmick and move back one space for each time they use your Gimmick!

You can advance using one of your fellow racers by saying their name on your turn. If they move at the end of your turn, you move forward extra spaces equal to the number of players. If they don't move, they get in your way and you move one space fewer forward.

First across the finish is the champion!

# Leaving the Station
```
Somehow you repaired the train enough to get it running. God knows if it'll hold up or where these tracks lead. Will you stay or go?

Introduce yourselves. You are three. The train carriage has room for four.

The youngest player goes first as Conductor. 


------------START------------


Conductor: Today you've imagined someplace fantastic the train could go. Describe it.

Convince others to vote go.


------------


Player to Conductor's right: You hesitate. Use what's been said to talk about how that place sounds different and strange. Compare to what is familiar to you.

Convince others to vote stay.


------------


Player to Conductor's left: You gaze at the empty seat. Recount a memory of a loved one. Then flip a coin. You think...

Heads: ...they'd love it there. Why?
Tails: ...they'd hate it there. Why? 

Decide to stay or go. 


------------


Bargain. Vote.

# Who's Driving the Van?!?
```
You've all been cursed by a disgruntled witch! Suddenly, you're all crammed into a single body! Hop in a nearby van but wait - where're you headed?
 
EQUIPMENT
            	Graph Paper
            	Pencil
            	8-sided dice (each)
 
GOAL
            	Head to the hospital? A church? To the big rides at the amusement park with this adult body? Each location is 10 grid spaces (5 if counting diagonally) away from the starting space. Players attempt to drive to a location of their choosing to deal with the curse.
 
ROUNDS
            	Each round, players repeatedly roll their die until someone rolls an 8. The winner can then advance their vehicle one space - forward, left, or right.
 
RADIO
            	Round winners may change the radio one station up/down. (Station order below.) Each player selects a unique favorite station, and gets +1 to rolls when that station is playing.
 
COMPLICATIONS
            	Whenever a player rolls a 1, call it aloud. Three 1s rolled by the group before anyone gets an 8, roll once on the complications list. That result is handled immediately.

# The Twelfth Labour
```
This game is best played with two players: the Hero and the Oracle.

Hero, you have one last quest to complete. And then, you will join the ranks of legend! Tell me, what is that task?

As you travel - How? - you come upon an arcane abode. You allow yourself this curiosity and peer inside. Seated is the Oracle, shrouded in cloak, but for their discerning eyes. Describe yourself, and your home, otherwise.

Hero, share your NAME, your SKILL, and your TASK. Of course, they already know this. Oracle, add a detail to the Hero's task, positive or negative.
 
Oracle, your prescience into the soul are without peer. Describe your divining instrument, and tell our Hero one positive or negative aspect of their past and future.

Hero, their insights have been received. Go on your way, and describe how you: Find comfort in your past, Take inspiration from the present, and/or Rush headlong into your future. For each, take 1d6. Oracle, take the same as well; you now represent the Hero's journey.

Roll. Whoever rolls highest, wins. In a tie, the *most* highest rolls wins.

Take turns (per the number of dice rolled) describing the Hero's victory (or defeat).
