# I_remember
```
This is a game for two players. One will play the role of a dying old man, while the other will play the role of Death and that of the people who mattered most during the old man's life.

Beginning:
A very old man lies on his deathbed. His life's six most important scenes flash before his eyes.

Scenes will be called by the person playing the old man using the sentence "I remember that time when..."
The mood permeating each scene will be determined by rolling a D6:

1: Sadness
2: Trust
3: Anger
4: Joy
5: Fear
6: Hope

The person playing Death will portray any other characters that might be present within each scene.
Different scenes might share the same subject.
Once the sixth scene has ended, the old man will describe Death's appearance, and Death will ask:
"Was it worth it?"
The old man will have to answer before he dies.

# Politicalia
```
Overview:
Players running a government with a GM (government figurehead) or GM-less (players as peers).

Aptitudes:
Aptitudes are resource pools that represent strength/power/clout in a political sector. The aptitude groups, Moral and Corrupt, each have 4 aptitudes.  Each aptitude is complemented in the opposite group.

           Moral - Corrupt
               - - -
    Constituency - Gerrymandering
            Whip - Lobbying
              PR - Spin
       Seniority - Bureaucracy

Character Generation:
Spend 13 points in each aptitude group.

Gameplay:
Turns are in order of Seniority.

Make a valid argumentative point with 1 roll per turn.  GMs (if applicable) introduce talking points and moderate.

Using Moral aptitudes increases that aptitude pool 1 point and decreases another moral aptitude pool 1 point.
Using Corrupt aptitudes decreases that aptitude pool 1 point and increases another corrupt aptitude pool 1 point.
These rules apply after all rolls.

Rolls are opposed between initiator aptitude and defender's same or complement aptitude.

(ex. One opposes another's Seniority with Bureaucracy -or- Seniority)

Dicepools are the sum of a single aptitude pool and its complement.

Die values 4-6 are successes. Most successes wins. Nobody wins ties.

Winner moves 1 point from loser's lowest aptitude pool to their same aptitude pool.

When any aptitude pool hits 0, that character leaves play.

# //BINARY MUTATIONS
```
2 Players

>LOG: The experiment was a disaster... The whole crew is dead...

A player represents a Survivor and the other player interprets rampant Artificial Intelligence (AI) trying to kill the Survivor.

The AI player writes a number from 1 to 999 and hides it from the Survivor. The Survivor takes the first turn. 

The Survivor has a total of 10 tokens to find out the code and destroy the AI. The Survivor can spend 1 token and ask one of the questions below.

> Is the code lower than N? 
> Is the code greater than N?
> Is the code equal to N?

AI response must be affirmative or negative: One or Zero.

If the response is One the Survivor gains 1 Action Point (AP).
If the response is Zero the AI gains 2 AP.

The AI can spend AP to generate Obstacles of the same level as the AP spent. The Survivor can spend AP same way to generate Actions to overcome Obstacles. Each player narrates their Obstacles and Actions.

During the AI's turn it can use Obstacles to reduce as many of the Survivor's tokens as the Obstacle level minus the level of the Action used by the Survivor.

# Stitch n' Bitch
```
Players are part of a knitting/crocheting group creating yarn crafts while chatting. 

There are two decks of cards: Patterns(PC) and Supplies(SC) 

SC show three things: 
-Yarn type (acrylic, wool, cotton, cashmere) 
-Yarn color (blue, red, green, black) 
-Tools (needles, hooks, findings, gauge measure) 

Each PC needs:
1 Yarn type
1+ Yarn color 
1+ Tools 

A SC can count towards only one, decided when played. Finished PC are placed aside, yarn discarded and tools returned to hand. Replace with new PC.

Each players starts with 3 face up PC and a hand of 5 SC. Place four face up SC next to the deck.

Each turn take 1 action then play a SC. 

Actions:
- Take and replace one face up SC
- Draw two SC from deck
- Draw and place another PC
- Frog a pattern (return all SC to hand, discard and replace PC) 
- Play an extra SC

If a pattern can't be replaced after being finished or frogged the game ends. Players gain point value of finished patterns and loose half the value of unfinished ones.

Turns should be quick and leave plenty of room for gossip, complaining and talking about who you're making each project for.

# Mix-tape
```
Each player needs to prepare two songs and add them to a playlist online or even a physical mixtape! 

The goal of the game is to create a narrative that fits the music playing. 

To start the game you shuffle and play the music. If one of your songs is playing, you tell a story until either the song ends or you pass the story on to another player. If you pass the story before the song ends, hit skip track on your music player. 

When a players first song plays, they introduce a character that fits the music, including how he meets all other introduced characters so far. You then progress the story as you wish.

When a players second song plays, they progress the story as usual, but they also have the option to retire their character in a fitting way. The game is over when the playlist finishes. All players then come up with an epilogue for the story.

# One stinky room with a wobbly table.
```
We are Orcs. In Dungeon. Sitting at table. With dice. Playing game in heads.

Cleverest orc is StoryLord. Makes challenging story.
One orc plays Crazy Goblin Wizard. Can cast magic. Choose type. Shadow, Gas, Pain, Falling, Fire or make something up.
Another orc plays Sexy Orc Thief. Can sneak, squeeze, climb and open locks. Can stab.
Next orc can play Fast HalfHuman With Bow and sword. Can shoot and stab. Can talk to Pinkskins.
Rest play Orcs. Strong, tough, mighty, hard, strong and tough. Can break things, cut with swords, stab with spears and roar away pain and death.

We tell great stories of Greenskins hunting, fighting, stealing. Even Heroing sometimes, just for kicks. Enemies are Pinkskins or monsters, other under-people or the Dark Lord and Capitalist Dogma. When Orcs win we get stronger, cleverer, richer and maybe have our own dungeon instead of one stinky room and a wobbly table.

In Story, difficult things need a good plan and a character who Can. If only one of these, StoryLord can say "Roll High!" and player need to roll high to do thing.

***
After one hour, adventurers burst into the room and kill all the orcs.

# Simple Farmer Geoff's Seed Exchange
```
=== INTRODUCTION ===
It's farming season and Simple Farmer Geoff (SFG) has the best seeds. You need them to survive.

 === PREPARATION ===
Set timer for desired round duration.
 
One player is SFG while the rest choose monikers as desired. 
Prepare numbered tokens (non-duplicated). 

SFG privately chooses one token to be the Rare Seed. 

Players put tokens in a container.

Each player draws one random token. SFG receives the rest in-container.

 === PLAY ===
SFG draws one token from container. 

Next clockwise player (P1) asks SFG "What is that seed worth?" or similar variant.

SFG responds according to seed value. The closer its value to the Rare Seed, the more preposterous. 

P1 may take SFG's seed, trade their seed for SFG's, or pass. 

If passed, SFG keeps that seed for themselves and draws another.

P2 questions P1 or SFG for an indicated seed. Players answer based on implied seed value via SFG's first claim. Continue clockwise.

Play continues until timer ends the "season." Rare Seed revealed. Players add seeds.

Values less than Rare Seed's added to player's count. 
Values greater than Rare Seed's subtract 5 points from player's count. 

Highest total value wins.

 === STRATEGY ===
Bluffing. Multi-seed claims. Consecutive seasons, new Rare Seeds. Rotating SFGs.

# Reverists
```
Humans process experiences in dreams.
REVERISTS instead exude them as a thick syrup.
Using these they concoct REVERIES: authored dreams.

Your workshop is a cottage on Rivulet Way, in the City Adherent.
After the Amaranthine revolution, the City is changing.
Its people crave dreams. And you're selling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREPARE:
- 6-sided die (D6).
- Deck of cards. Remove court cards & aces.


Each Reverist draws three cards. These are EXPERIENCES.
HEARTS: positivity, melancholy.
CLUBS: echoes of revolution.
DIAMONDS: hardship, drudgery.
SPADES: hopelessness.
 
Number indicates intensity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A PATRON wants to purchase a Reverie.
Roll D6 twice: a PERSON and a REASON. Describe the PATRON together.
1 Artisan / Inspiration
2 Veteran / Redemption
3 Firebrand / Hope
4 Workfolk / Rest
5 Ruined nobility / Acceptance
6 Child / Nightmares


Each Reverist commits one EXPERIENCE to the REVERIE.
Place face-down, reveal simultaneously. Describe your EXPERIENCE.

The highest numbered suit, added up, informs the REVERIE's tenor.
Describe the REVERIE together, using imagery from the EXPERIENCES.


Satisfied patrons pay D6 COIN per Reverist. Distribute among yourselves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Between CLIENTS, choose:
- BREAK: 1 EXPERIENCE per COIN spent.
- SECOND JOB: gain 1 COIN, draw DIAMOND.

Then MAKE ENDS MEET: Each spends D6, halved, in COIN.
If you can't, draw SPADE and suffer hunger / homelessness.

# Card Guided Role Playing Game
```
The game is meant to be light narrative driven game guided by the art work on cards (or the stats if so desired) of your favourite taro deck, LCG, CCG or any other deck of cards with artwork.

Using a deck(s) of your favourite card game draw cards to represent your character(s) abilities, motivations, goals, and relationships to other players and the plot hook (also from drawn cards). The GM draws cards for inspiration/ furthering events; players draw 7 cards at the beginning and may play them to influence the story swaying it in their favor rewarded more cards for great narrative by the GM. If there is dispute on an action's success play of an appropriate card in reference to their abilities to resolve it is appropriate, otherwise a consequence (distancing the character from their goal) or GM can remove a card from that players abilities or add to their motivation.

# Way Far
```
Around the fire, you and  your companions share one last meal. The shadow of tomorrow's task looms monolithic. You've travelled together countless miles to reach this point. Your journeys have brought some of you together, and driven some of you apart. Soon enough, the morning will come.

             ----------------------------

Choose one from each list, describe yourself out loud: 

» Builder, Exiled, Pilot, Slave, Heir, Archivist, Colossus, Pilgrim, ____________

» Wielding your grandmother's sword, Servant of Her Holy Light, A vow of atonement,  child of The Tower, A song in the darkness, mother of the wilds, touched by the Deep, ____________


             ----------------------------

As the fire burns low, you each take turns recalling a memory from your adventures together. The memory is fragmented, help each other fill in the blanks.

Choose, or roll 1d6. Tell the story of a time : 
You learned something
You took pleasure
You lost
You destroyed
You were changed
You found

When the outcome is uncertain or your memory becomes unclear, ask a companion to roll 2d6. That person describes:

6-    :   An undesired outcome, and how this brought you closer together
7 - 9 :   A complication in the situation, brings complication in your relationship
10+   :   Achieve your goal, but you are caught in conflict

# FADED
```
Three to five players.  One Driver.

Scenario: You don't know what happened last night, blacked out, no idea where you are.  Wake up, clean up, eat up, throw up, drink water, pop some aspirin.  What's that mark on your wrist?  A stamp, an ink blot, an X?  You start your day, it all blurs.  It twists, it warps, distorts.  You walk out, you see people, but they don't see you.  What did you do last night?  People walk past, not shunning you, but not even looking at you.  It's like you aren't even there.  You know you were having a good time, but you don't remember.  You see your friends, they don't even recognize you.  You see your family, they just walk by.  You backtrack. Retrace your steps, assemble what went down.  Put it all together.  What the fuck did we do?  Where did we go?  Why don't we remember?  Why won't people acknowledge us?  Find the answers to get back to yourself and break from being Faded.

Gameplay: Mark your hand with ink.  As the Driver helps you backtrack, roll 1d6.  If you roll a 1, wipe the mark once with a wet towel.  Get clean, survive.

# L'appel du vide
```
Decide who is The Dreamer. They keep their eyes closed during the game. Other players, Narrators, decide if this is "real" or "dream."

Narrators begin with: "You are standing on an edge."

Dreamer may ask what they: 
See
Feel
Hear
Taste/smell
Where they are
When it is 

Dreamers MAY NOT ask
Who they are
Why they are here
How they arrived

Dreamers may request details on each question once. Narrators who answered first may not answer again.

Narration should force the Dreamer to doubt their judgement. Narrators may exaggerate and employ flowery language but may not lie. If the scene is "real" the descriptions must be of real/common phenomenon. If the scene is a "dream,"remember the goal is to convince the Dreamer otherwise. Uncertainty and doubt are the narrative goals.

When all queries have been answered, or the dreamer decides, they announce whether if they Jump or Retreat.

If the Narrators have chosen "dream" and the player chooses to retreat the player loses. 
If the Narrators have chosen "real" and the player jumps then the player loses. 

Never tell a player if they have won or lost, ever. 
Select a new player and repeat.

# Fortuna Mythica [1-4 players, 20-60 min]
```
Separate playing cards into three piles: faces, red numbers, and black numbers.

One player is the 'Reader'.  The other's' are the protagonist's'.  Protagonists start by drawing a face as their character.

Hardships: Reader draws a face and improvises a Hardship based on the card's meaning.  Protagonists describe how they overcome it. 

Actions: Whenever protagonists describe contestable actions they take, draw a card from red and play it against one Reader draws from black.  Highest number wins, on tie redraw. A bigger numerical difference = greater result.

Players take actions until Reader decides the Hardship is resolved and next Hardship is drawn.

Protagonists: may force a redraw from their character card's color deck once per game.
Jacks get +1 to one draw per Hardship.
Queens get +3 to one draw once per game.
Kings can draw 1 additional card once per game.
Aces can force a Hardship redraw once per game.

# Flight 23
```
You are exhausted travelers who have been herded to the back of an airliner after suicidal hijackers took control over a populated area.

When you see "WORSE", any player should narrate the situation clearly getting worse; based on the hijackers, other passengers or something outside the plane. Use little details. Make it real.

You are going to die and you are trying to come to terms with this as a group.

WORSE

Who are each of you? Why did you travel? Who do you desperately wish you could speak to?

WORSE

Each character in turn can voice why they are angry about this situation. Use real emotions.

WORSE

Each character should express a deep regret they have in their life. Why does it affect you?

WORSE

Each character should point at who they are relying on for strength, and ask them for a few words of reassurance, even though they know it is useless. How are you holding on to these words?

WORSE

Talk quietly about what is going to happen and if you are ready for it. Don't agree. Just speak your mind.

WORSE

You see an opportunity to possibly overcome the hijackers. Do you take it? Vote silently.

# Confess!
```
The 2 players make up a story about a crime (crime scene, timelines, evidence and such). Then they pick 10 main details from that story (place, missing objects or even the name of a pet) that will be the focus of the interrogation between the players. After that, they roll a D6 and who gets the higher number decides the roles they'll be playing: detective or culprit.
Out of those 10 details previously chosen, the detective secretly selects 6 proofs: 3 which the culprit will have to confirm and 3 which they will have to lie about (because only the real culprit would know them correctly).
The interrogation lasts three turns, each turn the detective can ask two questions to the counterpart about the 10 selected details. The culprit can answer the questions saying the truth or lying. 
At the beginning of the third and last turn, the detective removes one of the 6 proofs he hasn't asked questions about yet. 
At the end of the third turn the culprit is arrested and loses the game if they had answered in the wrong way at least three times (lying to those the detective wanted them to confirm or vice versa).

# My Little Eye: An I Spy Melodrama
```
You are all the same character. Look around the room you are in. This is your location. Sketch out your circumstances using:

(CURRENT LOCATION) after (EVENT) seeking (GOAL)

Examples:
- Hospital waiting room after the matriarch's death seeking inheritance
- A coffee shop after the alien invasion seeking death
- The kitchen after 30 years seeking reunion

There are five rounds. The spotter chooses something in your location and declares its colour or starting letter. Every other player has a chance to guess. If successful, they narrate the negative version of what the object represents (ex: a bitter memory). If no one succeeds, the spotter narrates the positive version. The player to their left is now the spotter. Once everyone has been the spotter, the next round begins with a new emotion:

ROUND: POSITIVE vs NEGATIVE
1 Memory: Treasured vs Bitter
2 Sorrow: Old vs New
3 Dream: Pursued vs Abandoned
4 Resentment: Forgotten vs Fresh
5 Hope: Found vs Lost

After each round, total up negative vs positive outcomes to determine the dominant result. In a draw you decide. At the end of the game, these determine the overall emotions of the character and whether or not they meet their goal.

# It's a Hologram
```
"It's a Hologram" is a collaborative combat card game (CCCG) for four or more players - all you need is a standard deck of playing cards.

Begin by shuffling the deck and dealing one card to each player until no cards remain. The player whose last name is alphabetically first starts the game, playing any of their cards face-up on the table and saying an attack: "I strike with my blade," "I cast Dank Cloud," etc. Any first-turn attack is valid so long as the group deems it a "level 1 attack" by their metric.

The player to the right goes next, playing face-up any card that is immediately above or below the previous card in numerical or royal value. After saying "Ay!", the player must then say how they counter the previous attack: "I block with my shield," "I cast Soul Barrier," etc. Any counter-attack is valid so long as the group deems it not to be a gross overreaction to the previous attack.

No attack or counter-attack can be used more than once! Therein lies the rub!

Players are eliminated as they run out of cards, and the game ends when no cards remain. There is no win condition.

```
<hr>

# (UN)LUCKY
```
You'll need players and a Narrator, and a good story.

The Narrator will guide the adventure, and decide how many fail it's necessary to die.

Players describes their characters in a breef paragraph.

Start the game by everybody showing a number in the hands, at the same time. Divide in two groups, odd and even, whomever is in the same group as the Narrator starts unlucky, the others are lucky.

When it's lucky, your life is incredible, full of good surprises and wonderful people. You'll scape ambushes, scams and enviroment hazards. You'll never get lost. You'll escape every danger.

When it's unlucky, your life is miserable, full of problems and hateful people. You''ll be victim of all susprise attacks, traps, curses, scams and dangers. Everything bad will happen to you first.

When you can't decide the result of an action only by narrating it, play rock-paper-scissors. Narrates successes and fails accordingly.

When you get a draw, it will be a sucess for a lucky character and a fail for a unlucky one. After that, change you fortune! Lucky becomes unlucky and vice-versa!

When a player becomes lucky or unlucky as all the others, everybody else becomes the opposite.

# Sete - Drink in the apocalypse
```
SYSTEM

The  MMA champion:
Physicist | Social | Intellect
    3                1             2


DISPUTE OF ATTRIBUTES
When there are scenes in which an attribute dispute is required, one of the players may ask "get hands dirty'" and the players play odds or evens, and can not put zero.
The difference between the values placed by the two players is verified and the difference is added to the attribute value of the caller.
In the case of a tie, who called for a hand wins.

Decide who is the FOCUS for this event. That person describes the event with input from their friends. The event doesn't have to be bad: a birthday, a ghost wants to join the team, fanmail arrives. 
 
Assemble 13 TOKENS (candies, pins, etc.) in one pool. 

Your team has 13 ACTIONS to resolve the event. There is no set order; who acts next is determined by consensus. Spend a token to take an action.
	Support
	Develop
	Invent
	Contribute
(Interpret action types freely.)

Roll 1d6. 1-4 succeeds, except Support where 1-5 succeeds.

Narrate your success or setback. Friends can jump in any time to use an action. Group consensus determines final satisfactory resolution. 

If any friend is irrevocably emotionally hurt or dies, the game ends. Everyone loses.

# House Hunt-ed-ing
```
This is a game about the soul crushing experience of house hunting in a big city. If you have done it in real life, I salute you, fellow survivor; if not, count your blessings. 

You need:
A deck of cards (Jokers removed)
Paper and pencils 
4 Players

You are a couple or group of friends house hunting. 
Your requirements: number of rooms, location, etc.
Your budget: 29. 

Each player writes features for each card in a suit (aces -> 10). Low = bad, high = good. 

Suits:
Hearts: House features (garden, tiny kitchen) 
Diamonds: location (transports, sketchy) 
Clubs: agency/landlord (expenses, helpfulness) 
Spades: Bad. Just bad. (mould, mice, corpse in the cellar) 

Each turn, deal 4 to each player. 

4 cards = a house. Read the features to describe it. House cost = total card values.

If you draw a face card, put it aside and draw again. Play faces for special effects: 

Queen: discard a card, draw again.
King: Replace a card with any value
Knight: Switch 2 cards' positions

Turn end: Decide which houses to keep. You cannot have more than 4.

Build a house of cards with the discards. When it falls, or you finish the deck, time's up: choose now.

# Conches and Cameras
```
It is the morning after a storm. The beach is littered with debris tossed up by the violent ocean. You, and maybe your friends, comb your way through the detritus in the early morning and find something unusual. What is it? Pick below, or roll a die.

1. A sealed container. Perhaps covered in barnacles.
2. A message. Recent, or archaic?
3. A deepsea item. What dragged it out of the depths?
4. A relic from a forgotten age. How long ago did this sink below the waves?
5. An ordinary object with signs of usage. What was the previous owner like?
6. A precious treasure. Natural, or man-made?

If you're playing with others, pass the object around. Take turns noticing its features. Ask questions, tell stories, and give explanations. You can use the example questions for inspiration or suggestions.

The dawn is breaking. The sun rises over the ocean, so tempestuous the night before, and now impossibly calm. Will you seek out the previous owner? Keep the object? Or throw it out to sea, for someone else to find?

Whatever you decide, take the long way home, and have a cup of your favorite hot drink.

# Camp Lottaspirit
```
Divide players into a Scout Patrol (up to four people) and a Counselor (GM). Give one standard card deck to the Patrol and one to the Counselor. The Counselor has the Patrol choose a name, and has each Scout introduce themselves with the following:

Name
Two best camp skills
One worst camp skill (Optional: keep this secret!)

The Patrol's goal is to defeat the GM-controlled Ghost at the end of the five-day camp. Each turn represents one day. Each day, the Patrol chooses one merit badge for the whole patrol to attempt. 

Merit Badges:

Swimming
Hiking
Archery
Basketry
Archaeology
Medic
Music
Astronomy
Astrology
Ghost stories
Skiing
Carpentry
Sports
Theater
Lifesaving
Silence
Friendship
Farming
Poisonous Animals
Sailboating

They roleplay attempting this merit badge. Beware, the Ghost can (through roleplay) try to interfere! The Counselor determines which players successfully earned the badge. Each successful player chooses one card to remove from either the Patrol or Ghost deck. 

After five days, it's time to battle! Shuffle each deck. The Patrol and Ghost battle by playing the topmost card from their deck, with highest card winning and earning a point (ties to the Ghost.) Whichever side reaches ten points first wins the game.
