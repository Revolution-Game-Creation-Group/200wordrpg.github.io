# Bugbears
```
You bugbear. Bigger than human. Stronger. But bugbears can't get shit together. Can't cooperate. Victimized by human, who work as one, even when many. This about to end. All bugbears gang up, plan revenge.

Go in room. Find trash can. Dump on floor. Each pick through trash til find three things. Pick at same time. Fight for what want! Each use garbage, craft god. This your fetish. 

Everyone tell story behind fetish. Tell what is, how it part of you. Talk pain. Talk sacredness. Talk magic. When done, admire fetishes. Tell each other, "How pretty. How cool."

Now humankind pay. Make plans do simple thing: Go supermarket. Go bar. Must be outside, where human dwell. While plot, remember fetish. If bugbear disrespect fetish, call out on bullshit. Hold fetish high. All other shut up until done scold.

Scheme complete? Go out. Follow plan. Bring fetishes. Make sure human see them. Be proud! If human ask about fetish, tell its story. Finish plan. Return room.

Congratulate all on victory. Give big hairy back pats. Brag. Don't forget fetishes! When all feel good about selves, return to dens.

Or: Throw fetish back in trash can anytime. Become human. Leave room, game forever.

# Moonlighting
```
----------[ Background ]----------


Players are doctors.

Each doctor has one nurse.

Each game is one night on-call with 4 patients (encounters) per doctor.


----------[ Setup ]----------


Each encounter, the Game-Master secretly determines the ailment for the patient:

1d4 "____________"
 1    infection
 2    trauma
 3    failure
 4    hemorrhage   

Then roll again:

1d6 "of the __________________ system".
 1          nervous
 2          cardiac
 3          respiratory
 4          gastrointestinal
 5          genitourinary
 6          musculoskeletal

Example: "infection of the respiratory system"


----------[ Rules ]----------


- Game-Master plays the role of the patient.

- The doctor can ask 4 closed-ended questions to their patient, such as "where does it hurt?" or "what color is your stool?"

- Once per game, the doctor can wake their nurse to take a history and ask 2 more questions.

- At any time, the doctor can make a diagnosis. No other questions allowed after declaring a diagnosis.

- A correct diagnosis yields 2 points in addition to points equal to the number of questions remaining.

- Subtract 2 points for an incorrect diagnosis.


----------[ Winning ]----------


At the end of the game, each doctor totals all their points, receiving 2 extra points if they allowed their nurse to sleep all night. The doctor with the most points wins, which means they get tomorrow night off from work.

# De Bello Graffito
```
Decide to play this game before a trip.

PRIMUS 
Know this, you are all REFUGEES who escaped from a Secret War!  WHO WERE YOU BEFORE?

SECUNDUS
Psychically gifted - you catch glimpses from that world; but cursed - the War still ravages the Magical World you left behind, and now you can only bear witness. As you travel this Mundane World, you journey across the Secret World. 

Look for GRAFFITI. When it catches your eye, take a photograph. Each GRAFFITO is an eruption of psychic energy from that Secret War piercing the veil between our realities:

Is it an omen? Portent?  Lie. A rare Truth?
Perhaps, a request? Instructions? A map?
A victorious tale, or a doomed romance?
The last words of a queen, or a beggar?
A spell or dread ritual?  An attack!
The sig√ªl of your nemesis...

What it is, what it was, what it means - a riddle to be solved.

TERTIUS
Share your findings when your Cohort gathers.  Hopefully, through the Alchemy of Combination, we can understand these sendings and images. SHARE A GRAFFITO, explain what you think it means. Perhaps, another refugee will find meaning in it, and bring forth their own. Solve the Riddle. BEAR WITNESS.

# To Pay the Ferryman
```
You left your body in your dying breath and awoke in the moonless underworld.  You took only your memories and the coins under your tongue, one silver, one copper, to pay the ferryman. 

He waits beyond the five rivers of the underworld- rivers of Forgetfulness, Woe, Fire, and Wailing. The final river is of Hatred- the Styx. You must cross each river.

Once you pay for passage across the Styx, you may finally rest.

But the underworld looms vast. There are some here like you- still human. You travel together. 

Others lingered too long, and withered into hungry shadows. As you remain, shadows eat at your memories- memories of HOME, PAIN, FRIENDS, ENEMIES, FAMILY, AMBITION, LOVE, FEAR, HOPE, DEATH. What makes you cling to these memories? 

When consequences are unknown, toss the coins you carry. Two heads is a triumph. The copper head and silver tail is success, but at cost. The copper tail and silver head is failure, but with benefit. Two tails is defeat, and the darkness consumes a memory. Which one? Why?

Or, relinquish a memory to shadow and prevail immediately...

However, once lost, a memory cannot be returned. If all memories disappear, you fade into shadow.

# Writing History
```
You are from the future. You are four historians. You have discovered a city from Before. You have discovered knowledge. The wrong kind of knowledge.

Your society and its science are driven by conceptions of what is natural and what is not. You have discovered things that are not:

A pamphlet for a transgender support group. Science believes in a strict gender binary.

A poster for a charity fundraiser for disabled youth. Science believes it is natural for societies to abandon those endangering its productiveness.

A holy book. Science believes that pure rationality is inherent in humanity.

A collection of same-sex love poetry. Science believes in same-sex attraction not being true attraction.

None will respect your findings if they undermine science's ideas of human nature. They will if you present them in a way that supports them.

There are four turns. Every turn, each historian presents an explanation for an object. At the end, all vote for the most convincing. For every vote on the successful explanation, your team gains one credibility. In case of a tie, lose two. 

If at the end, your credibility is above eight, your findings are accepted.
If it is below eight, they are discredited.

# Mini Story
```
Mismatched miniatures must get home after their owner accidentally leaves them at a local game shop. 

=============================================
Minis 
=============================================

Embody a mini you've randomly selected from your collection or dreamed into being. 

You're 3" tall, plastic, and...
* Skilled; but especially known for one TALENT. 
* Flawed; but especially susceptible to one PITFALL.
* Loved; other minis are RIVALS.
* Ineffectual; you must cooperate to ACT.  
* Know humans can never learn minis are alive!

ACT as a party to get home. For your part in whatever plan's been cooked up, roll 1d6.

If party members are ~mostly~ your... 
* RIVALS; Roll another, take lowest.
* FRIENDS; Roll another, take highest.

If using a TALENT, ~also~ flip a coin.
* Heads; You impress! +2 to roll.
* Tails; Your PITFALL interferes. -1 to roll.

Total everyone's numbers. If higher than ABSURDITY value, the plan succeeds!

On FAIL, one mini shares a memory of your owner. One other mini can respond with a related memory. Their relationship improves one type: RIVAL < PAL < FRIEND. 

=============================================
GM
=============================================

When players... 
* Look confused: Set scenes, introduce conflict.
* Make a plan: Decide its ABSURDITY value. (2 for "a bit absurd"; 4 for "pretty absurd"; 6 for "now that's absurd!") x (party size) 
* FAIL: Make getting home harder.

# Operation Dinner Out
```
A black-ops team have a coded conversation in public about that time in Vienna

Pick a name for your agent:
Alex
Charlie
Hayden
Morgan
Sam
Taylor
Val
Also, assign one of the names to The Boss, and one to a recently deceased team member.

Pick a role for your agent <their special ability>
The Leader: charismatic, headstrong <Corporate Speak: ignores court card restriction on Spades>
The Lancer: grizzled, deadpan snarker <Snark: once per game can subvert someone else's detail and ignore 

court card restriction>
The Smart One: clever, nerdy <TechnoBabble: ignores court card restriction on Diamonds>
The Big 'Un: strong, silent <Menacing Undertones: ignores court card restriction on Clubs>
The Heart: balances and manages <Soothing Tones: ignores court card restriction on Hearts>

No-Dealer Blackjack - Keep playing til everyone has stuck or gone bust. The lowest sticking player gets the 

bill, going bust means blurting something need-to-know out in front of civilians. 

Add a detail to the story for every card. A court card means that the waiting staff are close and the 

details being discussed have to be couched very carefully.

The detail corresponds to the suit played
Hearts: personal entanglements
Clubs: physical violence
Diamonds: high-tech gear
Spades: paperwork

# I Am The Demon That Thou Hast Summoned
```
... and thou art a Magician whose heart doth ache: it aches for that which fate hath denied thee, outside thy grasp (but not outside mine). Speak aloud thy heart's desire.

Thou art skilled, Magician, and if my counsel doth offend, thou mightst banish me with but a wave and farewell. If so, we should count us losers both.

I shall question thee, Magician, and offer thee advice, upon which action shall lead thee to thy heart's desire. Thou needst not follow mine counsel and may askest after another path, but I shall humor thee only thrice.

Beware, Magician, for though my offers be true, I am a creature of deceit. I carry 'pon me, writ, the sin that is my nature, and my advice may tempt thee to it. If thou takest mine counsel, thou mightst guess of my nature: gluttony, greed, envy, pride, lust, sloth, wrath.

If thy guess be true, Magician, I shall count myself defeated by thy clever bargaining. If thy guess be missed, and we agree thy chosen path doth bringeth thee unto my sin, then I have won and thy soul be mine. Should we disagree, I shall twist thy heart's desire 'gainst thee.

# After the sun died
```
The sun has died. The world will soon follow. Chaos is rife, time is short and business is unfinished.

The game requires 3 or 4 players and a six-sided die. The players each play a member of a nuclear family, each with dark, unfinished business in their past that needs to be resolved before it's too late. 

Perhaps they seek revenge in a world free of consequences? Or absolution before the end?

Discuss tone and triggers as a group before play. Use an X card.

Take turns around the table to frame a scene which establishes your unfinished business - highlight an important moment that lends gravitas to the situation.

When it's your turn you play your character. The other players play their character or an NPC (depending on the scene).

Then everyone takes a turn framing a scene where we see the unfinished business being addressed. Right before the resolution, roll 1d6.

1: Death
2-3: Fail catastrophically
4-5: Succeed with a consequence
6: Succeed

Interpret your result and roleplay out the end of your scene. Once all players have framed their two scenes, each player gets to contribute one phrase describing how the world ends.

# The Retrospective at the End of the Universe
```
The old ones that have been long forgotten meet one final time before the heat death of the universe. The topic of last followers come up. Every one of primordials had one last follower.  The worshiper experienced one disappointment, and they lost faith forever.

Each player writes a disappointment, and a worshiper on index cards. Deal a random disappointment card and worshiper card to each player.

E.g. worshiper: Dave the librarian, a rock, Stacy the space weasel.

E.g. disappointments: bone cancer in children, lack of free will, no meaning in existence, no tacos on taco tuesday.

The gods first introduce each other by name and domain

eg:
  Halfnir - Lord of Pretty Lies
  Goldren - Mast of the Liminal
  Plang'nar - The Cosmic Leaf

In order each god gives a short biography of their worshiper.
Why the worshiper follows their god?
How did they die?

One other god reveals a disappointment card then describes the moment the follower experienced the disappointment. The worshiper's god must explain why the disappointment was necessary.

The gods vote on the justification. If the disappointment is judged justified, smite the worshiper and disappointment in accordance to your doctrine.

Save surviving worshipers and disappointments for future games.

GM chooses who has Light.

# Void Chaser
```
Step 1) Have an anxiety attack
Step 2) Slip onside this reality...
The drug is working - you know its signs: increased heart rate, sweating, rapid breathing, and distorted cognitions. Now go to work. While under its influence the void will reveal itself to you. The somatic symptoms of the drug will guide you, they will attenuate and crescendo like a grotesque internal Geiger counter shepherding you toward the mouth of this tunnel. Follow its invisible map, each action; each thought a Rubicon. You know from your training that this process is misery, but there is no other way - no real way. Drink a glass of water. Now drink another and breathe deeply or the drug may overwhelm you, freezing you, keeping you from your singular objective, leading you out of your tunnel of authenticity.  Do as much and go as far as you can while you are able to feel its pull. Once the pain has faded, the drug has worn off... and it is time to rest. Record this moment, where you are, who you are, take a selfie. Do this every time you take the drug. After a lifetime you will have found the void.

# Work Together or Die Alone
```
- 10 days. That's how long until help arrives.

You're holed up, hiding from what's outside. This place is unfamiliar but safe. For now. There are others -

Describe your character in turn, adding a detail to the story.

Assign your Relationship dice to others (d4s-d10s). For every d8 assign a d6, for every d4 a d10. Two d6s/d8s can equal a d10/d4. A Drop lowers a die one step. Spending Spirits negates Drops 1-for-1.

- Each day you prepare -

Each choose: scavenge Food, build Defences, raise Spirits (initially divide 6pts between them, collectively). Roll your lowest Relationship of those doing the same task (d4 alone). 1 botches, negate task successes and choose: -1 Food, Defences, or a Drop. Each dead character chooses an additional result. Otherwise, highest result: 2-3: Nothing, 4-6: +1, 7-10: +2. Play out the results.

Mark off Food each day, if you've run out everyone starves.

- Each night they come for you -

Roll 1d12 vs. Day count, optionally spending Defences to raise the result. If lower a random character is killed-taken-etc. Roll your Relationship: 1-3: You bear the loss, 4-6: Take one Drop, 7-10: Take two Drops.

# Con-Traction
```
Reaching your goal risks total collapse.


MATERIALS
 
3+ players
Strong bar magnets
Cards


SETUP
 
Choose the setting (e.g. Venice or a teenager's mind).

Choose the goal (e.g. monopolize the pearl trade or who to ask to Prom).

Choose your character (e.g. Alfonsi Trading House or thinking of Sam).
 
Place your magnet on your card so that if two cards touch, the magnets strongly repel or attract each other.

Arrange the cards equidistant in a circle with one pole facing center so the magnets aren't interacting.
 
 
GAMEPLAY
 
Proceed in order of increasing age.

Describe a scene involving your character and at least one other, illustrating an attempt to achieve the goal.

If your character is described in a scene, move your card one card width toward the center of the circle.

If your magnet moves off the card or touches another, your plans blow up. Reset to your starting position, and describe how the previous scene ruined your efforts.

When resetting, you may choose to be destroyed. If so, describe how another profits and move them toward the center. Make a new character.

The first character to reach the center achieves the goal and describes the end.

# SwordMasters!
```
One player is the GM.
Everyone else is a mighty hero of powerful emotions.
Have one bright die, one dark die.

Players: Write down your name and the things most important to your character.

GM: Set the scene of danger, focusing on one character. Roll the dice - high die determines whether the scene mood is bright or dark.
Escalate the danger. Continue escalation until the player picks up the die themselves.
You cannot permanently break or kill anything a player has written.

Players: React and roleplay the action. The active player will pick up the dice when this has gone far enough. Roll them, noting bright or dark high. Narrate how you overcome danger for the moment, keeping in mind the die mood. If no die is above 3, your actions have consequences in the next scene.

GM: Decide whether to end the scene, or continue with the focus on a different player.

Next: New danger scene from the GM, or 'player asks' scene.

If 'player asks', asking player gives dice to active player and asks how a past or new danger or obstacle was overcome.
Active player rolls dice and narrates as above.

Continue scenes until the story ends.

# Chiaroscuro
```
(To be played in a library, museum, or other many-roomed building.)

You are lost, Travelers, far from the dark world you once called home. Your compasses are broken. You're surrounded by alien light.

Share with each other your hidden names. Why did you leave? What do you miss?

Move from room to room: every threshold you cross is a portal to a new reality. When you arrive, count the light sources. The more there are, the farther you are from home.

Take note of local customs - things may appear the same, but they are not. People are strange here. What has changed? What are the dangers? Try to channel your fear into curiosity.

Take solace in your companions. Some may leave to search elsewhere: Mourn them. Hope to reunite later on; if you do, share stories of your travels. How have you changed? What have you survived?

When you find yourself in total darkness, you'll know you've returned home. Inhale. The infinite black of your world brushes soft against your wings. You are cloaked once more in familiarity: deep, solemn, safe. Nothing can harm you here in the dark.

Exhale. Let your own light out, now. Illuminate the space yourself.
```
<hr>

# Dine in and Die
```
Setup
You are trapped in a diner while something hunts you. Each player writes a conflicted relationship involving of 2-3 characters. You share ownership of these relationships & characters.

Loosely describe the threat that traps the characters.

Add two D6 per player to a pool.

Play
Take turns setting a scene alternating between one of the following:
Someone faces a frightening experience.
Confront a Relationship conflict.

The active player describes the scene, sets the stakes, and who's involved. Take 2-4 dice from the pool and roll. 
Players act out characters in the scene.

6s: a reconciliation reached, a danger escaped. Banish the die.
2-5s: Someone meets their fate and the dice are added back to the pool. You may banish the die to avoid their fate.
1s: Banish the die.

Climax
When less than half of the characters remain, or less than 1/3 of the pool remains, the final showdown begins. For each relationship reconciled, return a banished die. Roll the Dice pool.

Take turns selecting a die and describing someone's fate:

6s: someone escapes the diner.
2-5s: Someone sacrifices themselves to save another.
1s: Someone dies meaninglessly.

# The Zodiac Dungeons
```
You are a delver seeking legendary power! In the depths of the 17 Zodiac dungeons, monstrous guardians lie in wait for a worthy adversary. As you acquire their powerful relics, you will grow stronger; but so will your enemies. You must learn how to work together!

Choose from a Somatic (S), Brute (B), Assembler (A), Oracle (O), Filcher (F), or Titan (T)

Players and enemy stats are determined by a set of double six dominoes. Attack|Life. E.G., 2|4 domino = 2 attack & 4 life.

Players can do anything, but the GM determines if it's a FEAT or a SKILL. Feats are d12 vs d20; skills are d20 vs d12. Equal or exceed = success.  

Each monster initially rolls d20 ONCE for its challenge rating. Attacks = Attack (+bonus) vs CR. Tie = reroll.

When a dungeon is defeated, players draw a new domino and add it to their stats.

You begin in your guild hall. Good luck!

(GM ONLY! The diagram shows how teammates work together. 
Joint task bonus is +/-d6. 
Team task bonus is +d4, per teammate, up to 5d4.)

# Dealin' with the Devil
```
You have died and find yourself in hell. 

The Devil will release you if you can identify a fellow captive and keep your identity a secret.

Players select a deceased historical figure.

For every year since your death, take a point. Keep points secret until a tie, highest total breaks it.

Players RP, asking and answering questions, with only the knowledge their characters would have.

Cleopatra could not ask if someone was on television.

Deal a french deck as evenly as possible. Death, like life, is unfair. 

Decide who begins. They may pass, or assign a card to another player, who follows the card's directive, and then plays a card. Once played, discard cards. A player can risk half their cards to guess an identity. If a player runs out of cards or is correctly guessed they're eliminated. Play until there's a winner.

A- Playable anytime, skip directive.

2,7- 2 minutes of suit based RP

3,8- Answer 3 Y/N questions.

4,9- 4 minutes of suit based RP

                              SCENARI'ODDS'

---------

PLAYERS - 2

---------

TIME - 10 minutes

---------

REQUIRES:
6-sided Dice
One minute timer
Way of recording points.

--------------------------

TO PLAY:

One player starts as the scenario poser and outlines a challenge
for their opponent by giving them these three bits of information:

A Profession         - Safari Vet, Mafia Goon, Deathstar Pilot etc

A Scenario Challenge - Describe a setting and a task the opponent must perform IN CHARACTER,

A Restriction        - Choose one thing they 'CANNOT USE' to complete the challenge.

Say Go! and start the timer.

------------

In a minute, the opponent must verbally describe a way they will perform the task and must
designate something they will 'USE' to do so. They then throw a dice and on an:

Even - They are successful and gain a point for every attempt made this round,

ODD - They fail, must try something else and can no longer 'USE' their previously stated things.
(The poser must quickly describe what happened to the used thing before continuing).

The opponent now becomes the scenario poser and, after 10 rounds, the player with the highest score wins.

------------
Example:

You're an astronaut and 10 micrometeors have punctured the hull.
Fix holes 'WITHOUT USING' tools, GO!

I 'USE' my fingers?

'Odd'

'Ummmmmmmm........'

# The Temple of Nordu
```
You play five mages residing in the Temple of Norbu.
Four are following the teachings of Norbu - These are Guardians.
One is falling to the dark side; becoming the villain - The Fallen.

You need five six-sided dice.
Every turn a friend tries to talk sense into The Fallen with one sentence!
They roll their die, and the highest number wins the argument.
You act out the scene - but every time The Fallen wins he adds a +1 counter to his next roll, making it harder and harder to convince him not to stray from the light.
Every time a Guardian wins ALL guardians add a +1 counter to their next roll, making it easier to convince The Fallen to see sense.
When either side has +3 to their roll The Finale happens.

FINALE
The Fallen unleashes magic upon the temple and the Guardians roll their defence. 
Any Guardian who loses will perish. If more than two guardians survive, they take down The Fallen.
The Guardians unleash the fury of the Light to burn the wickedness out of The Fallen. They roll once and add together their eyes (without bonuses). If The Fallen miraculously withstands it; Darkness wins.

Save the temple!

# Folding
```
Five years ago the two of you sacrificed everything to be together safe from THE EVENT. Jin's cybernetics can no longer be recharged. Plex's family won't speak to you if you emerge safely. 

Either of you may have caused THE EVENT or imagined it. 

You are arguing about something that happened yesterday. What?

Make a character sheet listing these two memories:
- Something you miss
- Something you're glad you're rid of.
And one or more of the following - memories that give you: 
- confidence, 
- shame, 
- anxiety,
- motivation. 

As you argue, you may assert memories from your sheet as often as you like. When you assert a memory, the other player FOLDs their character sheet. 

FOLDING: bring some portion of the blank back to cover at least two letters but no more than half the words on the front. Write in the covered areas to modify your affected memories.

Memories asserted were part of the argument notwithstanding later modifications on paper.

Choose one memory to be SECRET from the other person. Both players FOLD when a SECRET is asserted. Regardless how the SECRET changes, it remains secret until you assert it.

The argument ends when a player can no longer FOLD.

# It's Not You, It's Me
```
Write a break up letter:

Explain how difficult writing this letter is.

If you're brave, reveal the purpose of your letter now.

Explain how it is not your intent to hurt anyone.

Soften the blow by mentioning a virtue you identify with.

Share a happy story of your past made possible by that virtue .

Explain that you have grown as a person, and are ready for the next step.

Cite a character flaw that you dislike.

If you weren't brave before, now reveal the purpose of your letter.

Reflect on your own behavior. How have you exhibited the flaw you dislike? How has that hurt you, or those around you?

Express sadness about this ending, but optimism for the future.

What will you do to be mindful about that going forward? How will that improve your life?

Go to the top of your letter and name that part of yourself.

Sign your letter.

Seal it in an envelope, address it to that part of yourself, where you live, put a stamp on it, and mail it.

When the letter arrives, allow that part of yourself to read it. 
Then let it go.

# Two hearts beat as one: a game for two bodies
```
this is a game of pulse-reading and heart-syncing for two bodies

play in the moments between moments. this game involves soft touch and quiet.

the only requirement for this game is mutual, whole-body continuous consent. it can stop at any time, you can change your mind, and agreeing to play doesn't mean you've said yes to anything else.

to play:

-take your own pulse on your wrist, inside you elbow, at the side of your neck, or on the top of your foot, at your groin, on your temple, or behind your knees.
-once you feel it, ask your fellow player if and where you may take their pulse. take their pulse while maintaining your own. 
-your fellow player will ask you the same, all while maintaining your own pulse and theirs. 
-hold your combined pulse until you both feel your two hearts beat as one.
-release.

roleplaying:

you are gods laying in the mud and wind of creation, your hearts-beats is the settling of everything. name yourself, your domain, and take pulses. once both hearts beat as one, both partners exchange the following statement:

"could you feel my ____?" 
"yes, I could feel your ____."

the heart-sync marks creation, then affirmation.
