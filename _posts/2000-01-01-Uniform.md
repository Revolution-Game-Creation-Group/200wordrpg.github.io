# Captivity of Consciousness
```
You were all locked down for what you believe. Every day a heavily armed guard appears and takes one of you from the cell -- you never see them again.
Today the guard came, but one of you fought back. Now the guard lies down as your friend died to escape. Yet the cell is unlocked and you may escape... Will you be able to do it?

Select one of you to be the GM and narrate the conflicts and results. The others are now fugitives in this underground complex. Each fugitive has one Specialty they choose.

Give each player (GM included) five tokens. When there's conflict, the involved players hide as many tokens as they want in their hands and reveal simultaneously. Whoever has most tokens wins the conflict (ties are still ties) and handles all revealed tokens to the other involved players equally, keeping the leftovers.
-Specialties act like an extra (virtual) token if they are related to the conflict.

Fight for what you believe. Fight for your freedom. Death is just another prison.

# The Synaesthetic Kitchen
```
The queen orders a magnificent confection for the 10th anniversary of her rule!

Materials:
Working kitchen (USE ADULT SUPERVISION).
Out-of-view adjoining room.
Scratch ingredients for confections.

Players adopt these roles:
Ambitious, pedantic BAKER.
Cowardly, nervous SERVANT.
Glum, resentful kitchen MINION.
Sprightly, loving kitchen MINION.

Each player rolls a D6 twice. First roll indicates an AFFECTED SENSE, the second a SUBSTITUTED SENSE. 

Doubles indicates a grievously diminished or overwhelmingly acute sense (your choice). 

Roll chart:
1.	Visual
2.	Auditory
3.	Olfactory
4.	Gustatory
5.	Tactile
6.	Emotional

Your character perceives and talks about the AFFECTED SENSE in terms of the SUBSTITUTED SENSE. Choose appropriate specific substitutions.

Ex. If your olfactory sense is AFFECTED and your visual sense is SUBSTITUTED, you might choose to perceive a BURNING SMELL (or the word "BURNING") as BLURRED VISION. Be consistent. You henceforth always perceive and discuss burning smells as blurred vision.

BAKER commands the MINIONS.
MINIONS do all mixing, measuring, baking, decorating.
BAKER desires glory, fears infamy.
BAKER always improvises, never uses written recipes.
MINIONS are never in the adjoining room; BAKER is never in the kitchen. 
SERVANT relays messages and objects between rooms.

The game ends the queen's confection is completed.

# The Colony Ship RPG
```
You are all commanders on a colony ship looking for a new place to call home. Your current star is about to go supernova, which will make the whole system uninhabitable. Recently, your captain has caught an unknown illness and is being kept in stasis until a cure is discovered. During this time, the commanders have been put in charge of the ship.

Player's will create their own commander by giving them a name and choosing its race (human, alien or anything else). They will then decide if the commander gets a Physical Boost or a Mental Boost.

When a commander attempts something that requires a skill check, The game master decides if it's a physical check or a mental check. The commander will then roll a die (d6). If they have the matching boost for the skill check, they can add 1 to the result. If the result is 4 or higher, they complete the task safely. Otherwise, The game master can decide if they've failed the task or something unfortunate happens while achieving the task.

One final thing, any decision regarding the entire ship or the mission needs a majority agreement from the commanders.

# Unofficial Superheroes
```
You used to work for United Superheroes Inc.  You were a public superhero, fighting supervillains and protecting innocent civilians.  You also made public appearances, endorsed products and gave interviews to boost the company's image and bottom line.  They dictated every aspect of your life.  You were a resource to them, not an independent person.  But now you have broken your contract with them and gone freelance.  They are very unhappy, and have publicly branded you a supervillain. 

You have two of the following powers: Absorption, Animal Control, Energy Blast, Element Control, Flight, Natural Weapons, Regeneration, Shapeshifting, Shield, Super Strength, Telekinesis.  Tell everyone your name and why you hate United Superheroes Inc.

When you wish to act and the outcome in in doubt, roll 2d6.  If the total is 6-9 you succeed, but you don't manage to impress anyone.  If your total is 10+, you succeed and manage to win the support of people nearby.  If you are using your powers to defend civilians, roll 3d6.  If you are acting to oppose United Superheroes Inc., subtract 2 from your roll.

Prove to everyone you're not the supervillains United Superheroes Inc. says you are.

# Marketing Simulator 2018
```
Setup

Players write 1 *secret* commercial product on an Index, which can be fictional/real services, brands, or tangible things.

Narrator makes up first scene's set-pieces (2-3)

Players give the GM their *secret* products(hidden), describe their character, and distribute 3 points between their Act stats on an Index. 

Act stats
Screen Time (everyone starts with 3 in this)
Range - alter or replace character
Emotion - address the audience directly
Action - do stuff
Prop - introducing a new set-piece.

Play

Narrator sets the scene using aforementioned set-pieces.

Players declare an Act stat, and bid Screen Time to Act.

Bid winner gets to Act. 

Ties for Bids are decided by rolling/rerolling a d6 for each point in an Act stat. Highest single roll wins (for ties, both Act collaboratively)

Acting players spend Screen Time bids.

After all players have acted once in a scene, the Narrator narrates the scene with their own interpretation, and introduces a new set-piece. They discard and reveal one of the secret commercial products that they have decided will not be chosen.

Narrator sets the new scene.

Continue this way until the third Narration, whereupon the Narrator closes the commercial by introducing the product they have chosen

# Worth
```
Two players, ten coins of local currency, two minute timer. 

One player - One coin - Beggar - Lives in poverty.
One player - Five coins - Chooser - Lives in comfort.
Place four coins aside. 

Start the timer. Sun rises.

Beggar requests coins. Pleads, bargains. Like life depends on it. It does. 
Chooser ignores Beggar. Defers, fidgets. It's your money, not some junkie's. You earned it.
Each time Chooser makes eye contact with, or acknowledges, Beggar during timer, Chooser begrudgingly gives Beggar a coin from Chooser's pile. 

Timer ends: Cold night comes. 

Beggar: Put a coin aside. Say what food you scrounge and where you shiver sleeplessly. Put aside more if you want some comfort: Booze? Dope? Say how great it feels.
Chooser: Consider how many coins to place aside. Perhaps two? Perhaps five? Describe your extravagance: Brunch? Jetski? You've earned it. Then, retrieve four coins from aside, you've earned them too. 

Reset the timer but not the coins, continue playing. 

When Beggar cannot pay a coin to eat, you starve, and freeze to death. Chooser: Place your remaining coins aside, tell the Beggar what you bought and why it was worth more to you than their life. Declare the game over. 

You've earned this.

# The Connection: A space Travel
```
This is a narrative game about long distances, explorations, revelations and self knowledge in a space travel.

You need:

2 peoples. (A GM and a player)
2 smarthphones (with instant mensseger)
Sincerity, sensitivity and creativity


The Mechanical:

The international phone number of player represents the travel.

[5] [5] [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [0]

From first to last, one by one, each number represents a result for the travel narrative.

GM ask and the player answer with the next number.

9 or 0 you're ok
6-8 is ok, but it's complicated. Why?
5- The truth is terrible


Modifying results:

The player may include aspects of your real life in fiction to gain +1 in your result.


The first question for this game:

You're on a lonely space travel. What do you search?

[Player answer]

Example: My travel is a search from the past [result: 5] [because i'm a historian: +1 = 6]


From the results, continue describing and asking:

What's around?
What's it?
Where are the old crew?
Where are you going?
Who're you?
Who's that?
and others...


After the last number, you two describe the arrival and talk about this travel.

# DoUndo
```
Two demi-gods trying to prove each other wrong about the meaning of a mortal's life. One of you (Do) was trapped inside a labyrinth while the other (Undo) handles the rooms and encounters inside it. 

Shuffle a rubik's cube and give 6 colored cards to Undo, each card a color in the cube, and a concept. 
Blue:Sloth Red:Lust Orange:Gluttony Green:Envy Yellow:Greed Black/White:Wrath

Undo chooses a card and narrates a story bit with the concept, presenting an obstacle (AND solution) for Do inside the labyrinth until he runs out of ideas, while Do tries to solve the cube. 4 minutes minimum.

If Do completed the side shown in the card, earns a point. Otherwise Undo earns it. Cards can only be played once.

2 minutes pause and cube is passed. Do must narrate the solution that the character came up with for that conflict, while Undo shuffles the cube. If the solution proposed isn't adequate given the narrative, Undo may ask Do to re-think it. 2 minutes, minus 20 secs x side solved by Do.

Repeat until Do solves the rubik cube (Do wins), or when Undo runs out of cards. Highest score wins.

# Circus Clown Bank Robbery
```
You are a circus clown. You and your clown colleagues are robbing a bank. Why? How? That will be discovered as the story progresses. The GM fills in the scene. You can request a backstory scene anytime to flesh out how things got to where they are. Write down details as you elaborate on your character. Who are you? Who are the other characters? What brought you to this? You will find out as they are defined through narrative storytelling. If you take a contested action (where there is a chance of failure and consequences for failure), roll two dice. For something your character is bad at, take the lowest result. For something your character is good at, take the highest. Otherwise, take the average. 1-3 is failure, 4-6 success, round up. The backstory you create dictates your character's skill.
Maybe you're not after the money, maybe you're stealing sensitive documents from a safety deposit box.  Maybe you need money to pay for your daughter's surgery, or crave the thrill, or have no retirement, or you are a just simple clown mixed up in a robbery. 
Now, one of you must shout "EVERYONE ON THE GROUND" and begin.

# Good Dogs || for 5 with PnP + playing cards
```
Players play the role of a feral dog.

Players draw three cards and pick a character (only one of each).

Brute - Subdues any man or dog
Smart - Opens unlocked doors, plays dead
Mobile - Faster than anything, climbs
Scrappy - Starts with 6 cards. Charms humans.

Difficult actions not in your character niche require a check (ie, killing another dog, escaping gunfire). GM draws a card, and player must discard enough cards to match or exceed it (facecards = 10; aces = 1). Nearby PCs can play a card to help. Drawn cards go to discard pile that's shuffled back in whenever players get food.

1 food = draw 1 card

No cards = dead dog

For GM:
Before play, lay out grid of 12 cards. Each is an urban block. On face cards, lay another.

King - Armed man; hunts humans not of his suit
Jack - human corpse (8 food)
Queen - burning ruins
Joker - water

Value indicates amount of item
Hearts - hidden food
Spades - pack of hungry dogs
Clubs - unarmed humans
Diamonds - park/lot

Other dogs and humans may be friend or foe. Humans hunt maneaters.

Remember that PC dogs:
-can't read
-see black and white
-have dog's nose and hearing
-understand body language, not words

# This is How We Died
```
Write a bunch of things on slips of paper. Put them in a bowl. They can be real things like pianos, iguanas, or caramel. They can be concepts like happiness, obscurity, or downing. Call these "death cards."

Then write a bunch of rules on how to talk on different slips of paper. They can be things like "no words that start with 'L," "rhyming couplets," or "never use pronouns." Put them in a different bowl.

You are in the afterlife waiting to be reincarnated. Take turns. When it is your turn, grab one to three death cards and explain how you died from those things. Then it's the next person's turn.

When it is your turn again, you've died again. Dying hurts your brain. Grab a slip from the second bowl. Your brain has been broken so you can only talk that way. Grab more death slips and explain how you died again.

Keep going, adding more and more restrictions on how you can talk. If you run out, write up more or maybe the game just ends.  Go until you've all had enough. Laugh!

# You Know This One
```
3d6 in order.  Probably at least twice: body and mind.  Maybe add speed,
soul, grit, charm, whatever.  Higher is better.  That describes you.

Tough guys: d8 for hit points.  Wimpy wizards, d4.  Others, d6.
Things hurt you and take away hit points.  Get to 0 and you die.  Get
them back with food and sleep.

d20 for combat.  Untrained hits unarmored half the time.  Skilled
fighter hits chainmail 3/4 of the time.  Small weapons: d4 damage.
Most things: d6.  Swords, axes: d8.  Zweihanders, halberds: 2d6 but go
last.

Try other things.  Decide the odds, roll d6.  Lower is better.

After a while you get better at things.  Roll up some more hit points.
Hit and succeed more often.

Enemies have hit points and armor too.  Meaner equals more, but more
treasure, and you get better faster when defeating them.  Enemies can be
monsters.  People can be enemies.  People can be monsters.  Monsters can
be people.

Imagine stuff and make it happen.  Crawl into holes, kill goblins.
Conan and Gandalf team up to fight Donkey Kong.  Go nuts.  It's your
game.

Wizards cast spells.  Make up their effects.  Go nuts.  It's your game.

Go nuts.  It's your game.

# Does anyone remember Bob?
```
Most of you joined the support group when the first symptoms emerged. Others waited a lot longer.
Some of you are here for the first time. Some have been coming for months.

All of you had heard stories about the illness long before you were infected: How it spreads. The growths. The deformations. The camps.
But none of you knew which stories were true and which ones just rumours. You still don't know for sure.
There is no cure. The transformation is inevitable. It will only get worse. You will be taken away.
That's what they say.

You are hiding your infection from your relatives and friends. This group is the only place where you can talk freely about it. About what you've heard. About what you've seen. About what you experience.


Appoint one group leader. Everyone tells their story. Talk about your fears. Introduce facts and rumours about the illness. Share memories. Disagree if necessary. Try to work out the truth about the illness or at least an approximation of it.
Go back and forth. Expand upon what other people say. No monologues. The group leader intervenes if necessary.

The session ends after one hour. Meet again next week.
```
<hr>

# Time Council
```
The Time Council meets to adjudicate a conflict about (pick):
    [ ]  Inheritance and forbidden love in Merovingian France
    [ ]  Cold War espionage & nuclear escalation
    [ ]  Fame and disgrace during the colonization of Mars

Group yourselves into three named factions around a table. Elect a Facilitator. Each councilmember says exactly ten words about the event. Decide how the factions publicly disagree about the canonical timeline. Each faction also writes a facedown index card containing their secret timeline agenda.

Debate is by parliamentary procedure (motions can cut debate short, re-elect Facilitator, etc.), majority rule, in a workaday tone. Whenever a motion fails, the proposer calls a Scene from the timeline ("I would like to enter into the record this chronofootage..."), writes an index card for it, places it on the table in time order, casts other players from at least two factions, directs the scene ("cut", "freeze", "angrier", etc). Play as high drama. 

Facts established in the Scene stand, unless paradoxed by two-thirds majority and a new Scene from the alternate timeline, same characters & setup, overlaying the old Scene. 

When each player has set a Scene, reveal secret agendas. A faction prevailing publicly and secretly both is triumphant; either, satisfied; neither, discredited.

# We will Knot Go Quietly
```
The world is unraveling. You and yours stand upon the last knot of sanity. Of reality. THEY are here, and you need to survive the night. That's as far as you can think ahead. 

First - Where are you? Describe the place you're all holed up in.
Second - WHO are you? Describe yourself. Your old life. Your two things you brought with you. 

Choose how long this night will be, from 4-8 rounds. 

Then The Problems arrive. Each player takes a turn playing a problem. Describe what it is, whether physical or some concept made manifest. Describe what threat it brings to you all. Everyone determines how serious it is, from 1-7 (1 is easiest, 7 is impossible). If you can't agree on severity, the Problem chooses alone. 

Everyone else discusses how to 'solve' the Problem. One person rolls 1d6. If items or history apply, add 1 to the roll. Meeting or beating the severity succeeds.

At the end of the night, tally up successes and failures. Are the Problems that remain sufficient to end your stay on this world? Do you become unraveled, or do you live to try to eke out another day here?
```
<hr>

# Secret Person of Color
```
Divide players evenly into 2 groups: Average and PoC

With uneven numbers, Average takes the extra player.

All players name their character; PoC also pick a secret biracial ethnicity.
Averages choose a PoC character to separate and question. Questions include, "What are you?" "Where did you get that hair?" and "You look exotic." Treat the last statement as a question. 

The PoC must convince each Average of the validity of their ethnicity with pictures, stories, or family history. Roshambo determines if the PoC is able to get the Average to acknowledge the PoC's marginalized status. If convinced, the Average tells a story about a friend, restaurant, or movie that features part of the PoC's ethnicity. The round ends when the PoC has tried to convince each Average, successful or not, and then introduces the Average group to the next PoC. 

Average earn:
1 point for each listening to, believing, or knowing a fact about the PoC and/or their heritage
3 points for response story
5 points identifying a "fake PoC"

PoC earn:
1 point for each supporting fact and Average convinced
-5 points for each person not convinced
-7 points for pointed or angry comments

# An Ablution of Sorrow
```
The Witch Queen, your beloved twin, is dead. You are a failed Sentinel of Hell's Gate - and her only successor. Before you ascend the Rowan Throne, you must undergo a rite of cleansing.

Before play:

With your finger, write "Are you ready now?" on the bathroom mirror.

Play:

Take a steaming hot shower. Wash yourself, solemnly, reverently, and in the order given. As you do, relive the memories described.

Feet, then legs: the secret you discovered and your fury as you abandoned your post

Arms, then hands: your lonely uncertainty as you refused your twin's patient overtures

Back, then front: your jagged guilt when you finally returned - too late - to save those you once swore to protect

Hair: your twin's gentle care as she tended your demon-inflicted wounds and the whisper of renewed hope

Face: grief, grief, endless grief, at her sudden and needless death because of your weakness

When you are done, step out of the shower and look to the mirror. Your sister is powerful - death cannot stop her from sending you a message. Can you see it?

If you can, respond to her.

If you can't, ask yourself if she has forsaken you at last.

# SEVENTEEN CATS IN A TRENCHCOAT
```
(5+ players & GM)

When the Nefarious Plan entered its final phase, your captors blew up their incriminating lab. KABOOM. Walls to rubble, evidence to ash. But also, cages to splinters. Hooray! Freedom smells of singed cat hair.

Unfortunately the Nefarious Plan is still afoot.

But ho, what's this? A discarded trenchcoat? Quick, everybody get in and act human! You have to warn the Prime Minister before it's too late!


FIRST:

-	Cats never get to choose their names. Have the player to your left name you. Write your name down.

-	Write down one skill, acquired from your captors' mad science (dentistry, lawn care, etc.)

-	Do this without thumbs. No thumbs on cats!



MANOUVERING YOUR WOBBLING TRENCHCOAT

-	Upon encountering an obstacle each player describes a unique plan for success.

-	The GM secretly selects the Best Plan.

-	By simultaneous pointing, players vote to enact one plan. Most votes wins.

-	If the plan chosen is the Best Plan, the trenchcoat succeeds!

-	Otherwise, count the number of votes received by the elected plan and add +1 for each applicable player skill.

-	If the total exceeds the number of players, the trenchcoat succeeds!

-	Else, the GM introduces a complication. Oh no!

-	Coin flips decide draws.

# Ink
```
The Library is under attack. Grab a book and prepare yourselves Ink Mages. 

A party of players chooses 1 book with which to defend the Library. Use this opportunity to set the Library and Characters. One of the players is the Antagonist.

The Antagonist is the first to act. They may Attack the Library (Use 10 pages), Attack the Mages (Use x<11 number of pages to stop PC action), or Flee.

To respond to any of the actions, a Mage chooses up to 1 sentence from a numbered page in the book. This is the action that your character takes. The player then chooses up to 10 more numbered pages to power the action. Write down the starting page, adding the number of pages used (Use pg 1 powering up with 5 more pages; pgs 1-6) in a place the whole group can see. These pages are no longer available to use as they power the action, wiping the pages clean.

The game is over when the Antagonist Flees or is defeated. The players lose if they use all the pages. It is a stalemate if the using last pages caused the PCs to defeat the Antagonist.
```
<hr>

# Wetwork
```
Players play as Assassins or Targets. Assassins want to kill all Targets. Targets want to fend off assassins. 

Players pour themselves Water, Caffeine, or Alcohol. 


A player's drink determines their character's archetype:

Caffeine - Clever Assassin: +1 to rolls involving smarts
Alcohol -  Erratic Assassin: +1 to rolls involving force
Water -  Target: +1 to rolls involving self-defense


Player drinking the strongest caffeine is the Leader, they describe each scene, and set goals for Assassins/Targets. They still play their character.

Players drinking water (or the weakest drink) are a Target. Targets have guards and resources. They describe obstacles and complications in the scene.

Player drinking the strongest alcohol acts first when a new scene begins.


Roll 1d6 for uncertain actions:

6 Succeeds
4-5 Succeeds for a price (determined by Leader for Targets, determined by Targets for Assassins)
1-3  Fails (and rolling player drinks)


If a player uses the bathroom, their character is suddenly in life-threatening danger (described by Leader).  Players can attempt to save that character before the player comes back. If they don't, that character dies.

If a player finishes their drink, their character dies.

Game ends when all targets are dead, or all assassins are dead.


Cheers!

# The Whole Potato, All At Once
```
This is a universal, diceless RPG, suitable for any setting or genre. 

You have a character who is represented by a potato. When you wish for your character to accomplish something risky and consequential, you must take a substantial bite of your potato. If the bite of potato you have taken leaves your mouth before you swallow it, your character dies. If you swallow your bite, the action succeeds. If it is the LAST bite of your potato, the action succeeds beyond your wildest dreams and you level up (which here means "get a new potato"). This DOES mean that you may go for a very large bite to accomplish a sufficiently difficult task, which does in fact mean that you might have to eat The Whole Potato, All At Once. 

ERRATA: If you are a member of the human species, to whom raw potatoes are mildly toxic, a whole stick of butter may be substituted. If your companion is unable or unwilling to consume their potato, you may aid them by taking their bite for them. You may have a beverage, but you must consume an entire juice glass of the beverage in one go before the game starts.

# Keep It Casual
```
2 players, over chat.

Alex and Robin. You met through friends. 

Characters: age (20-30), look, what you do/like, how the character is different from you (player). Say what about the other struck you. 

Choose secretly:

You feel - insecure, unlikeable, fake, vulnerable, dependent, lonely, confused, trapped

Your facade - irony, cynicism, aloofness, contrariness, independence, disaffection. 

Now:

You want to know them, you want them to like you. 

Use texts/chat, 1 brief exchange per day - keep it casual, discuss movies, books, politics, yourselves. Ask questions. Maybe flirt. 

The Question: find out what you feel/want. Is it a crush? Friendship? Love? 

The Code: never speak about your feelings/desires/vulnerabilities. If you're asked or would like to, keep up your facade. Be flippant, aloof, or "fun". Copy that message in a document, write your true answer beside it. Don't share that.

OPTIONAL: At any point, one may write "so, last night...": you kissed/hooked up at a party. Imply what happened (there was full, informed consent), never tell in full. 

When you have an answer to the question, or when you break the code, or when it peters out, stop playing. Talk it over, share the secret documents, explain yourselves.

# Coin.heads
```
You are crooks in any setting where crime exist.


CONFLICTS

1. State intent.

2. Determine disposition:
  you have upper hand      advantageous   3 coins
  the powers are equal     risky          2 coins
  you're at disadvantage   desperate      1 coin

3. Toss the coins.
     
4. GM offers a cost (alarm triggered/bystanders hurt/ammo depleted). If you accept it, you may toss additional coins (the same amount), adding them to the result.
Repeat until cost is too high.

5. Count heads:
  1 - weaker alternative to original intent
  2 - success
  3 - triumph


COUNTDOWNS

1. Write impending event on a sticky note (guards alerted/hostage killed/evidence erased).

2. When something advances the countdown considerably/severely/tremendously, add 1/2/3 coins on the note, then toss all coins on it.
If less than 3 heads - countdown continues, otherwise the event happens.


LOOT
When selling stolen goods or getting paid, each player gets Loot coins.

Between missions, player may convert Loot to Aces (keep their pool separately). Spend an Ace by tossing it into a conflict. Use flashback to retroactively describe cool gadget/bribed NPC/devious plan.

Alternatively, Loot may be added to plot-level Countdowns (get rich/track down nemesis) to advance team or personal agenda.

# ZineFest!
```
For many players. You're all zinesters who want to make new zines for the upcoming zinefest.

Any zine you make is an experience- with each issue, each page, you're getting better at your craft and gaining more skill.

Roll 1d6. Your zine is that many pages. Reroll on a 1. If you roll the same number as another player, you both collaborate on the same zine!

Choose the content of your zine or use a prompt! Roll 1d6 for a prompt:
1- autobio comics
2- poetry
3- book/movie/tv review 
4- a recent dream
5- diy instructions
6- a social issue you're passionate about 

What is your zine titled? Is it the first issue of a series or a one-shot you don't plan to continue? 

Zines have to have covers. Put together something related to the content or anything you think is interesting!

Once everyone's made their zines, the zinefest arrives. One of the best things about zines is getting them out there- finding people who see themselves in your work, having yourself heard, learning from the works of others. Trade your zine with someone else!

Thank the other zinesters, and say goodbye until next time.

# This Weight We Share
```
You (and up to six others) play the contents of a cursed Video Tape, taking turns describing what lies beyond the Television. 

The Tape Player must describe the room they see from behind their glass screen.  With precisely 1 minute 47 seconds to describe as many vivid visual details as possible. 

Is it the teenage girl sat peering out from behind clenched knees? 
The peeling wallpaper and thick blinds in the ancient motel?
The neglectful father with a glass of wine while his infant son peers at you?
The half-burned couch propped up against the door as if keeping something out?
The way she claws at her face when she realised the mind-bending horror you contained?

While the Tape Player describes, the others must note or sketch their impressions of the scene in accordance with the Tape Player's design. 

When the Tape has been played 7 times, giving everyone the chance to be the Tape Player at least once, then the game phase shifts. 

The players now all play the Final Victim and must piece together what binds the previous scenes, what clues that other victims might have missed. In this cooperative stage the Victim can finally break the curse.

# Impin' Around
```
You'll need a Gamemaster and 2-4 players. Roll a D6 for each action you take. The higher the number, the better. The Gamemaster will determine the results. 
 
You're the children of the world's greatest sorceress. She left you home alone! Of course, you're not allowed in the lab. But strange sounds came from inside, so you investigated! You'd barely cracked the door before something escaped. 
 
Now there's an imp loose in your house. If mom finds out, you'll be in SO MUCH TROUBLE.
 
The imp is very skittish. When you find him, he'll dash to the next room. Chase him back to the lab to Lock. Him. Up! Roll to see what room he's in. 
 
1. Armoury. Enchanted suits of armour here. Don't let them catch you! 
2. The living room. There's a herd of angry dust bunnies between you and the imp in here.
3. The attic. Full of boxes of baby clothes and ancient artifacts. 
4. The greenhouse. Beware of not-so-friendly plants.
5. Apothecary. Some potions here might help... If only you knew what the labels meant!
6. The lab. You win! The imp starts here so reroll if you get this on the first try.
