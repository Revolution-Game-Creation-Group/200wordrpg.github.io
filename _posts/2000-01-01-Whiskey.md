# It's Always Been a Dive
```
You are employees in a seedy dive bar, churning through concepts, owners, and crimes. Requires: Index cards; pool of 5 Mismanagement tokens per player.

Players take turns writing the Dive's Features on cards: Name, Theme, Clientele, House Special, Secret. Players create two Employees each, with: Name, Position, Descriptor, Vice. Each player starts with one character Employed; set the others aside as Unemployed.

One player (the Owner) watches the other players play a scene in the Dive (~3 minutes). The Owner awards one Mismanagement each for: Encouraging others' Vices; abusing their Position; creating conflicts between Employees. Track Employees' conflicts and crimes as Baggage. The next player becomes Owner; repeat.

After the Mismanagement pool is half-empty, the Owner may change one Feature per scene as they frantically attempt to salvage the failing Dive.

When all Mismanagement is spent, the Dive fails. Fire the Employee with the most Mismanagement. Strike one of their Baggage items. Play a scene explaining why that Baggage collapsed the Dive. (Re)hire any unemployed character to replace them.

The next Owner rebrands the Dive, changing two Features. Return tokens. Give Employees one Mismanagement per struck-out Baggage. The Dive reopens, continuing until alcohol or ennui overwhelms the players.

# Word/Cross
```
Find a novel or novels no one cares about. Cut a page from the book for each of the players.

Each player chooses one side of their page.
Each player underlines a word or phrase on their page to be their name.
Each player circles two adjectives on their page to be their signature abilities.

The GM uses the blurb on the back of the book to create the scenario, and describes it to the players.

When you encounter conflict, cross out two-three words on your page, and use these words to describe how you overcome the conflict. 
The words must be used in the order they appear on the page.
The words you use must be relevant to the situation.
For each word you have crossed off, roll a D6. 
You can use your signature abilities without crossing them off to roll a D6, or you can cross them off to roll 2D6. 
On a 10+ you succeed. 
If you fail, cross off a number of lines on your page equal to 10 minus your roll. The GM describes what befalls you.
If you run out of lines on your page, you die.

# Night of Decisions
```
comedy/drama
30-60 minutes

You need
Per player: pen, four index cards, glass, cork
Champagne or substitute

Agree on a setting where strangers can meet over a drink.

Everyone writes on cards
1) a noble goal
2) a weird habit
3) a grand desire
4) a dirty deed

Distribute cards randomly among players, one of each number per player.

You are dissatisfied, because 3) is unfulfilled, also you tend to get into trouble due to 2). You decided to give your life meaning through achieving 1), which lead you to commit 4).

Develop characters secretly.

You all meet by chance, spend an evening drinking together, and finally make a life-changing decision.

The game is played in three acts:
1) Arriving
2) Revealing secrets
3) Making decisions

At the beginning of each act put corks in the middle and refill glasses. Toast to the Night of Decisions. Act ends when all glasses are empty. No refilling during the act. 

Any time anyone can take a cork and give them to any player, unless they have a cork in front of them. The recipient puts the cork down as marker, takes a sip out of their glass, and makes a confession.

# An Unsuspicious Night Out
```
You're kids (teenagers, coworkers...) out for a playdate (movie, pizza...).

Each player chooses a Target player and secretly writes two commonly used words (called "Triggers"): "yes", "sure", "but", "okay", "still"...
If they know the Target's player enough, they can write a word the Target specifically uses very often.

Now they explain their relationship to everyone else: "friends since forever", "still getting to know you" and so on.

A player tells something about themselves (a funny thing they did/saw, a little gossip...), then asks another player something ("What about you?" is fine).
Continue until everyone has spoken, then repeat.

Whenever your target speaks a Trigger, stop them.
You noticed a suspicious detail in them: what? (e.g. "Is that blood?").
The target can find an Explanation for the detail, like "Accidental cut" (you secretly write +1 Trigger), or deny it with an Excuse, like "Oh, just ketchup" (you write +2).

When someone reaches 3 Explanations/Excuses, they must reveal their horrifying secret (invent it now; make it coherent with all accepted details).
They then secretly write 2 Triggers with "everyone else" as a target.

The game ends when everyone's secrets are in the open (the last revelation is optional).

# Middlesax
```
Once each generation, the stars shine black, and Faeries plague Middlesax.

The six village Elders have seen this before, and begged the Bishop for aid.

You arrive at nightfall, with four Conviction and five Faith. The Elders greet you in the square. Describe them, and your journey from the monastery. The GM will describe Middlesax. 

You sense the Fae are here because of an Elder. Discover who, and why, and the Fae may leave.

Each day, the Elders try to further their schemes. Regain one Faith if you bring peace, one Conviction if you find comfort or friendship, never both.

At night, you banish Faerie glamours. Choose a number of Faith to Spend, roll 2d6 + Spend.

On a 10+ Middlesax is safe.

On a 7-9, choose two:

   An Elder perishes.
   Lose one Conviction.
   Your efforts tomorrow are doomed to failure.
   Cursed: -1 to future rolls. 

On a 2-6, the GM chooses three, and Faeries kidnap a Child.

The GM will describe it.

If you lose all your Conviction glamours overcome you, you abandon Middlesax. 

If only one Elder remains, they confess, but Middlesax is lost.

If the Faeries kidnap three children, they leave, but return next generation.

# MinMaxer
```
Setup:

Players start by each deciding on a trait to embody. Traits can range from D&D(Strength, Charisma) to outlandish(Deliciousness, Indignation). Each player rolls 4d6, removing the lowest die. These scores are assigned later.

Each player has a d6 and 4 points. Points may be spent to increase die size(d6->d8->d10->d12->d20). For every point spent, write down a negative aspect(Clumsy, High-Cholesterol). Unspent points are used to re-roll.

Creation:

Decide on a player order, using die rolls to resolve disputes. Starting with the first player, choose an unassigned score. The active player and any players of their choosing roll a total, optionally re-rolling their own die once for each unspent point. If the total is under the score, subtract one from it, and next player becomes active.

Otherwise, the active player's trait is assigned the score. The highest number rolled adds their negative aspects to the character. Players involved should narrate how their trait helped the active trait develop. 

Repeat until all scores are assigned.

Play:

Discuss this character.

What story is this character in?

How does each trait define them?

What does each trait do on adventures?

How does their story end?

# A Mingling of Awareness
```
Boko-maru: the supreme act of worship of the Bokononists, which is an intimate act consisting of prolonged contact between the naked soles of the feet of two persons. It is said to be the "mingling of awareness."

When playing this game, sit on the floor. Bare your feet, and be sure you have washed yourself. Together you will be telling the story of a lone traveler seeking enlightenment. 

Touch your soles to the other player's. Set a scene, then ask them a question. They will answer it, then continue the scene and ask a new question.

When choosing a question to ask, consider the feel and character of the other player's feet. How do they move? Are they timid, or comfortable? Rough, or soft? Do you feel invited or rebuffed? How alike are their feet to those of the traveller?

Here are some example questions:

How do they react to that?
When do they get there?
How long does that take?
Who sees that?
How does that go wrong?

Play ends when one of you is asked a question you don't want to answer, or one of you retracts your foot.

# Goodnight Kyle.
```
How to Play: Become Kyle. Game Pieces Required: A bag of standard birthday balloons.

Everyone is Kyle and Kyle has the balloon again.

Everyone must grab a balloon.

Every Kyle must inflate their balloon and subsequently, as soon as everyone has filled their balloon, instantly start releasing the air out of the balloon (making the most annoying sound possible by pinching and releasing the opening of the balloon with two hands to impede other Kyle's from talking.) 

Every Kyle must tell us about their entire day.

There is no order in which a Kyle can speak because every Kyle is above the law. 

If you laugh or fart, you lose.

The game is over when all the balloons are out of air at the same time or if every other Kyle has given up by saying "Good night, Kyle."

If a Kyle's balloon is out of air. A Kyle can refill their respective balloon but then all Kyle's must immediately start talking about their trip abroad, all at the same time.

If a Kyle is filling up their balloon at the same time as another Kyle, all the other Kyle's must scream in agony but keep making annoying balloon noises.

# The Rabbit's Scream
```
You are in love and hunting each other. One of you believes you are hunting the other for the greater good. One of you is toying with the other because you love pain and the chase.

Write your character's name, three traits, and what you are (doctor, werewolf, etc) on one index card each. Write one trait of your lover and why you love them on their own index cards, give them to your lover.

On your turn, your lover is the scene guide. They set the scene and present a conflict that will draw you closer to a final confrontation with your lover. When you need to resolve any uncertainty, flip a coin and call heads or tails. If you win, the scene resolves in your favour. If you lose, your lover takes one of your cards. You may change a fail to a success by sacrificing one of your cards and losing that part of yourself. You may destroy a part of your lover instead if you have one of their cards.

A final confrontation comes when one character has no cards left. The confrontation ends when one or both loves are dead.

# Yu-Gi-Oh Season One: The RPG
```
You are playing a children's card game about monsters. 

The fate of the universe is in the balance, somehow. 

The rules are...fuzzy.

Use a standard deck. Start with 5 cards. Draw 1 each turn. 

Hearts are Monsters. Spades are Traps. Clubs are Magic. Diamonds are Wild. 

Write the following rules on a sheet:

0. You may only summon one monster a turn. 
0. Monsters attack once a turn.
0. Traps must be played facedown and triggered later
0. Magic and traps don't do anything
0. You must play cards for things to happen.

When you play a card explain what it is. 

You may, at any time, overwrite a rule or introduce a new one. Write it on the sheet and put a number one greater than the previous rule. Roll d6 equal to that number. If you don't roll any ones, all good. If you do, your opponent can immediately react to negate your action.

Monster face cards have special abilities. Make them up when relevant. 

Other face cards remove one d6 from a roll to introduce new rules (minimum of one). Aces always roll one d6 to introduce new rules.

Play until you decide it's getting old.

# Ramblin' Man
```
One player is the Stranger, the other the town.

Together, create six townspeople, each with issues to resolve. Decide who the Stranger is-- scam-artist, politician, missionary, all that matters is they're selling something.

Turns 1-6: a different Citizen confronts the Stranger. Play the scene to a climax, then roll two dice.

If...

...The Stranger can pitch their project as a solution to the Citizen's problem, roll another die and drop the lowest.
...The Stranger can base their pitch in something they've said to another Citizen, roll another die and drop the lowest.
...the Stranger's pitch contradicts the Citizen's worldview, roll another die and drop the highest.
...the Stranger's pitch contradicts to something they claimed earlier, roll two additional dice and drop the highest two.

1-6                      They don't trust the Stranger.
7-9                      They're uncertain, but buying.
10+                      The Stranger wins them over.

Turn 7: An Authority figure arrives. There is a final judgement. Play to climax, then roll three dice.

If the townsfolk are...

...Suspicious, drop highest.
...Supportive, drop lowest.
...Uncertain or Tied, drop median.

1-6                     The Stranger flees town.
7-9                     The Stranger's plan succeeds.
10+                     The Stranger feels sentimental, and settles down among friends.

# The Blood Must Flow
```
Autumn.

Sunburnt hills under heartbreaking skies. Soil rich and bitter as chocolate. Trees groaning with half-fermented fruit, leaves turned flaming hues, beasts fatted for the slaughter.

People here live decadently. The land feeds them, and they thrive.

But it comes at a cost.

Tonight, the land must be fed in turn: thirsty soil watered with blood.

First, though, a feast.

For each reveler, choose a craft (butcher, winemaker, orchard-keeper, etc) and think about their look (use colour, texture, smell, animal imagery).

Starting with whoever last touched the soil, introduce your reveler. Describe the gift they bring to the feast: what it is, how it looks, how it was made.

Now, begin play.

Make merry: converse, eat & drink, swap stories, sing, dance, slip away seeking privacy. Frame scenes and take turns as the mood takes you. Remember, make everything lush, morbid, and visceral.

When you all agree it's time, the party ends. The killing-time has come.

Each reveler votes for who should feed the land.

If you are chosen, describe your death. The others describe how they prosper this year.
If there is a tie, famine comes. All describe how the land turns sour and brings you low.

# The Seed
```
The seed grants one wish and one curse. The greater the wish the greater the curse. 

THE SEEKERS must find and destroy the seed. (1 for every 4 players)
THE KEEPER must pass on the seed. (1)
THE DREAMERS must obtain the seed. (Everybody else)


SETUP:
Randomly and *secretly* distribute the roles. Each player grabs an object. The object the keeper chooses is the seed. Start a fifteen-minute timer. 


GAMEPLAY:
Eat food, hang out, trade objects. Talk of the seed and what you'd wish for. 

At time:
    1. Each non-seeker holds and wishes upon an object. 
    2. Each seeker kills one player who they think holds the seed. (This can include themselves.) 
    3. The keeper announces which object is the seed.
    4. If the seekers are correct they win and the seed, holder, and keeper are all destroyed.
    5. Otherwise the holder's wish is granted. The keeper decides a fitting curse.

If the holder is the keeper or nobody then the keeper dies; if a seeker then they get no wish, only a curse. 


VARIANT: 
Each person writes down a character (ex. "Snotty Ambassador," "Mighty Wizard," "Talking Dog"). Randomly assign these. Players must now roleplay as their character.

# Among the Wreckage
```
In a moment, everything you knew was obliterated by the Faceless Beast. After a sleepless night, dawn finally breaks over your destroyed home and life. What can you recover today?

Tell one another what or who you're searching for - Loved ones? Shelter? Transportation?

Scatter a deck of cards facedown. Roll a six-sided die for first player, proceeding clockwise.

Roll the die.

Pick up as many facedown cards as the number rolled, placing them face up in front of you.

Narrate a scene describing your search, incorporating these elements based on revealed cards:

Diamonds: Collecting supplies

Clubs: Navigating wreckage

Hearts: Finding nourishment

Spades: Meeting someone else

(Even numbers represent complications. Odd numbers represent aid.)

Face Cards: Encountering another player. You must either give them two of your cards or take two of theirs, incorporating your choice in your scene. If no one has two or more cards, there's no interaction.

Aces: Reaching your current goal. Describe the scene (incorporating any other cards revealed this turn) and what you're searching for next.

Play until all aces are found. Then darkness falls and you must make camp. Take one final turn each to reflect on the day's events and describe preparations for tomorrow.

# Dungeons & Driving
```
Dungeons & Driving is a slow-paced road trip RPG, where the driver of a car is the DRIVEMASTER and the passengers are WARRIORS, SORCERERS or ROGUES.

Play begins when adventurers enter a dungeon (i.e., the car enters an on-ramp). The Drivemaster tells a story, and at critical junctures when the adventurers encounter a monster, trap, or other obstacle, they are challenged to find a vehicle of the the Drivemaster's choosing on the road. This is their opponent. The first player to find it is drawn into battle.

Battle Order:

Drivemaster adds the numbers on the opponent's license plate.

Players add the numbers on the plate of the first vehicle of their type they see (warriors are SUVs and trucks, sorcerers are vans and sedans, rogues are motorcycles and compacts.)

High number wins.

If the player prevails, they receive treasure based on the defeated plate. Local plates are 10 gold pieces. Plates from bordering entities are 20. Other rewards are determined by the Drivemaster. If a player loses three battles, they're eliminated. The player with the most treasure at the dungeon's exit (an off-ramp or a mileage goal set by the Drivemaster) wins.

Customized/homebrew car rules are encouraged!

Create Nobles
Year and King's death recorded
Create Candidates
Candidate Speeches
Candidate Influencing
Noble's Vote (If Liberum Veto used return to 2)
King crowned/Bonuses awarded

Candidates have stats; Wealth, Claim, Popularity, Power. There are six points to distribute.

Nobles have; Voting Block, Land, Military, Wealth. There are six points to distribute. Nobles have Prestige at 0.

A Candidate, if elected King, gives 1/2 of their stat (plus gifts), rounded down, to Nobles who supported them; Wealth - Wealth, Power - Land, Popularity - Military and Claim - Voting Block. The Noble connected to the King (same player) increases Privilege by 1.

Liberum Veto: If a Noble does not want the vote to pass they may declare "Liberum Veto" at anytime and stop the election.

The first noble to have Influence 4 has won.

# Be A Cat
```
Choose a Goal:

	Eat 				
	Scritches			
	Murder				
	Human Food			
	Sing the Song of your People	
	Sleep				
	Investigate			
	RUN!	
			
Choose a number between 1 and 6, roll 2d6.

If the numbers:
match - Success! Narrate your excellence. Spend a Round enjoying your superiority.
 
are different, but one shows your number - add together for your butt-wiggle-pool.
 
are different, but not your number - subtract the smaller from the larger then subtract from your butt-wiggle-pool (if you reach zero, take a Round to push stuff off the table).

are a 1 and a 6 - it's a Botch, oh no. You have been scooped up and snuggled. But you are a cat, so spend a Round licking yourself, erase your butt-wiggle-pool then choose a new Goal.

At 12 butt-wiggles, Success! Narrate your tenacity and endurance.

Each time a 1 appears a Terrible Thing appears! A Busy Human, Sky Water, Closed Doors, That Dog! or A Noise. Narrate vanquishing the Terrible Thing.

Once you have achieved all Goals, you are Best Cat but also become a Terrible Thing, when you roll two 1s, narrate accordingly.

The game ends when all cats are Best Cats. Or continues, nobody tells cats what to do.

# Uber Share
```
Number of Players: 3-5
Duration: Any, though probably less than an hour
Setting: A car
Equipment: Chairs set up to resemble a car, index cards

Uber Share is a freeform game about people using a taxi-like car-share service.  The tone can be silly or serious and may change during the course of play.

One player acts as the driver and is the facilitator of the game, determining the length of each passenger ride, prompting questions when conversation falters, and possibly misrepresenting the nature of the car's previous occupants.  The other players are the passengers. Passengers may enter singly or as a group. When one passenger's ride ends, the player may re-enter the car as a new passenger.

The game starts with the driver alone in the car. The first passenger gets in, giving the driver a card with their name, destination, and character motivation/goal.  The driver controls the flow of the game as they pick up new passengers and drop off old ones as new temporary communities form and characters share their stories and perspectives.  Interactions between passengers is encouraged.

The game ends when the driver announces the last pickup, drops them off, and heads home.
