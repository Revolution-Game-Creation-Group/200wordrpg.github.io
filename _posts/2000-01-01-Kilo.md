# ApPeer
```
Got an important meeting and just can't get there? Don't waste your time with cyber-presence. Our hosts are waiting. Wearing special headbands linked to their phone, your face will appear over theirs. They see a real living person - no tiny screens, no being stuck to the wall. Make a "personal" appearance without leaving your couch. That's convenience. That's aPeer. 

Everyone finds a picture of a celebrity, about A4 size. Ideally one they admire. Cut it out of the magazine or advertisement or print it out. 

Gather. Pass your celebrity to the player to your left. 

Pick up the picture and hold it over your face. That person is now using your body through aPeer. Talk to the other celebrities. You're all at the same event, how exciting. Talk about how you don't normally use aPeer but there's a taxi strike, a fuel shortage or you had trouble finding a babysitter. They don't have a union but you always tip. 

Comment on how nice your aPeer host is. Perhaps the last one was a bit smelly or a bit fat?  Commiserate others if they got a fat one. 

Leave a comment for your aPeer host, and a rating out of five.

# Judgery: A Nomic Adventure
```
Divide the group into PLAYERS and JUDGES.

Make one index card each for:

   "AXIOM: rules must be no more than 200 words".
   "AXIOM: rules must describe a game".

Notecards represent the rules.

1. Give the rules to the players. Players must each obey the rules to
   produce a document that violates the SPIRIT of the rules.
2. Judges decide what went wrong. Each proposes a new rule change and
   judges vote whether or not to accept it, ties broken by coin flip.
   Any rule change must be one of: ADD A MUTABLE RULE, MAKE A MUTABLE
   RULE INTO AN AXIOM, MAKE AN AXIOM MUTABLE, or CHANGE MUTABLE RULE.
   Put new rules on a new notecard.

Repeat until exhausted, giving the ammended rules to the players each
time.

If all of the legal submissions suck, the players win. If one or more
of them is pretty good, the judges win.
```
<hr>

# Judgement
```
Sit somewhere comfortable with a group of people. Everybody should have some kind of beverage. 

Look at the person to your left, you are them. Without speaking to them first, tell your life story to those around you. Make sure to include all your darkest secrets and the things you've been afraid to let others know up until now. Continue around the circle until everybody has finished their drinks. Consider the implications of the stereotypes you've been labelled with. How does that make you feel? 

Grab another drink and go around the circle again, but this time take about your hopes and dreams and the sort of person you want to be. Remember, you're still the person to your left. Have your feelings changed? 

Hopefully they have, and now you'll be a little kinder on yourself and others.

# Surrender: A Game About Giving Up
```
You, four players in a darkly imagined now, are the crew of the Nighthawk, a ship of war. Your nation has just surrendered, and occupying forces will be coming to collect you in a matter of hours. There is no avoiding this.

Taking turns, share a past decision you regret. Choose or create a pair of needs that represent the struggle you faced. Players may have the same needs; it's more important that they be resonant than unique.

Self-esteem --- Acceptance
Freedom --- Safety
Principles --- Loyalties
Survival --- Ambition

Take turns calling scenes; each should address a piece of unfinished business you have. The players to your left and right portray your inner voices. At any time, they may speak up if they feel you are at an important junction; when they do, they will each argue for an action that satisfies one of your needs. The player across from you, your Judge, will decide which action you take.

It is up to you to portray that action: how you go about it, how it makes you feel. Continue until your unfinished business is resolved.

When everyone has called two scenes, the occupying forces arrive. Hereafter, the future is uncertain; surrender to it.

# You Have 200 Words
```
The state of the world is such; there is suffering, there is hopelessness. This is a wasteland. This was once a vibrant land of possibilities. No more.

The people have been reduced to being described in two words, an adjective and a noun: "discrete rebel", "doubtful soldier", "valiant mother". To act is to roll 2d6, and to fail is to roll under 6. Above that, there is a small success, there is self satisfaction, there is nothing more. One may add 1 for any applicable descriptors.

Hope lies in the magic, and there is only so much magic as there are words. Take a pen and cross out a word in this text to add 1 to a roll. Take a pen and circle five words to speak a miracle described by the words, before striking them out. Destroy ten words to make a true change for the better.

You may adhere to the rules of this text when it is changed, but to do so is to destroy this world as written. Perhaps you will make a better world. It is more likely you will doom it to nonsense.

When the words run out, all hope is lost.

# Some Adjudication May Be Required
```
Player's Handbook: 
We should play lawmen and desperados but decorum constrains us after a certain age.  Thus, runes are used to denote characteristics.  Often, they are numerals to lend an air of credibility and provide a basis for comparison.  Thence, all players are equal but the Game Master is more equal.  Take thou a heap of dice and cast them.  Call some results good, others bad.  Divine from them; play proceeds apace.  Situations will develop.

Game Master's Guide: 
Events contain danger which yields tension and spurs reaction; hilarity ensues.  A milieu develops.  Group innovation should not be deprecated.  In the mind's eye they'll become heroic; that world then services them.  That which is simplest is intelligible, thus enjoyable.  Pick thou a genre to aid simplicity.  Hidden meaning must be obvious.  Secret things must be found out.  Stereotypes should not be despised.  Don't overmuch concern thyself with coherence, as the mind is enamored of pattern and will force it, regardless.

Monster Manual: 
Thou shalt foster much fear in them by often presenting the other.  The other should be similar but yet strange.  Even the smallest divagation from their normal can form the basis of hatred.

# Letters to the Home Front
```
Players sit back to back, a WWI soldier and a loved one, each with an envelope, 16 moral tokens, and half a deck of shuffled playing cards (soldier has diamonds and spades, loved one has hearts and clubs).

Turns represent a month at war and players will draw up to 5 cards (hand limit of 5). Any black letter cards (J,Q,K,A) immediately go in front of the player as emotional scars (these are removed when you receive a Red face card). Players select cards to put in their envelopes, narrating letters as they place each card (red = good things, black = bad things) with any moral tokens to swap (one for each red card more than black).

Lose a moral:
If you end your turn with no red cards left in your hand.
If you receive a letter with only black cards.
For each black letter card in front of you at the start of your turn.

Players should only convey information through their letters they are composing. Received cards go into your discard pile, and are reshuffled when your draw deck runs out.

If before 12 months any player loses all their moral the game is lost.

# TRAMP
```
A collaborative game of value creation using Fudge Dice (dF) marked [+], [_], [-]

Players are business associates venturing into the Tramp Trade

At each stage, each player: 

	Divides up to three dice between the ENTERPRISE, and the player's GAIN.  
	Each die allocated represents a chance for RETURN or RISK

	For each die allocated, describe how they add value to 
	the group's shared ENTERPRISE, or the player's own individual GAIN

		OWNER: Describe your VESSEL and how it helps the ENTERPRISE or PERSONAL PROFIT

		BROKER: Describe the CARGO or YOUR CUT

		PURSER: Describe how you improve EFFICIENCY or TAKE KICKBACKS

	Roll the dice for the shared ENTERPRISE:
		Count [+] and [_] towards the MARGIN.  Count [-] against the MARGIN.

	Roll the dice for the player's individual GAIN:
		Count [+] and [_] towards GAIN.  Count and [-] against MARGIN.

After all have rolled, if the margin is negative or any player wishes to exit the GROUP, 
divide the margin between players and sum with their individual GAIN.  
The net result is their profit or loss.

If the margin is positive and all players wish to continue, iterate the game.  
Positive margin may be spent 1:1 to negate RISKs.

# One Color Short of a Full Box
```
Requires:
A box of crayons, color pencils, or pens of a variety of colors
3 to 6 players
Creativity

Play starts with the player whose last name has the same number of letters as the items in the container of crayons, pencils, or pens. In the case of a tie, use first or middle names. They are the first to judge the names.

All other players should select a crayon, pencil, or pen from its container. Each person should invent an outlandish, ridiculous, or otherwise silly new name for the color of the item with the goal to make the group laugh the most.

Once everyone is ready, the names are shared starting to the left of the person judging the current round. The winner receives the item and it is removed from play. The winning player is now the judge for the next round and the other players start again.

Play continues until the container is empty. The player with the most items is the winner.

# Curb Your Better Off Always Sunny Development
```

Spitball on a setting.

Each PC is, regrettably, affiliated to the others.  Write four character traits on individual index cards.  Take three chips.

Play three acts of three scenes.  Open on every PC together at a neutral location, and freestyle roleplay until everyone is satisfied and two or more characters have episode goals which don't align.  Following scenes are framed by the most recently humiliated character's player by default, but players may bid chips for control. At least one character is present. Others may be, either at the framer or player's discretion.

Each scene has one conflict.  If the conflict is PC against NPC(s), the framer handles the opposition.

Each party (or team), in turn, picks their own trait to use positively or an opponent's trait to exploit negatively, placing the card mid-table, facing themselves.  Continue until each trait has been used, or everyone passes.  Each character/team rolls two dice and adds the number of cards facing them.  The highest scoring character/team narrates the remainder of the scene but must use each talent they listed. 

At the episode's end every character who completed their goal AND suffered mortifying disgrace gains a new trait.

# Curse You, Dingus McRee!
```
Everyone (up to 6 players!) hates Dingus McRee.  The characters hate him so much they have consulted the Internet to perform a ritual to curse him.  Did it work?  Or did they curse themselves?

The play sequence is as follows:   
 
Players roll 1d6.  Their number is their turn order (1=first, 2=2nd).  Ties re-roll until there are no duplicates.

The first player describes a basic, everyday task that character is performing.

The next player then describes the ritual to curse Dingus McGee and the previous character's responsibility in the ritual.

The final player then describes something that may go terribly wrong for the first player while doing their basic, everyday task.

The first player then makes a Luck roll.  To do this, the player declares a number and rolls 1d6.  If the character's declared number is no more than 2 numbers away, it means the ritual was a success!  If the declared number is 3 or more numbers away, it means the ritual was a failure and something horrible happens to the character.

Repeat for each player.  If at least half of the characters succeed, then the ritual was a success, and Dingus McRee is cursed!
```

# Cocktail Barbarians
```
You are all Barbarians, empowered by the spirits of the land through traditional Shamanic Alchemy from the Cocktail Mountains.

Get a lot of different bottles of spirits together, as well as a few mixers and weirder stuff. The more the merrier. Get a scrap of paper for each ingredient and write a cool barbaric verb for each Spirit and Adjective for each mixer. Use the basics, like Punch, throw Lightning Javelins, and Argue.

Each Player comes up with their own Barbarian with a cool name, maybe even a personality beyond shouting.

Starting with the person who brought the most booze, each Barbarian narrates a scene involving an obstacle that must be overcome by one of the other Barbarians. One Player then alchemically assembles a cocktail from the available drinks, then combines  the cards into saying how  his Barbarian defeats the obstacle. Note what was in each drink.  That player now starts describing a new scene. If there's a teetotaler, they can stay as narrator.

Keep this going until the story feels finished or it's a health risk. The Barbarian who drank the largest variety of Liquids becomes the new Chieftain.

HARD MODE: Only bring a small amount of each drink.

# Reykjavik
```
World powers vie for supremacy at a chess tournament.

Setup
A chess set (32 pieces) is placed into a bag. 4-6 players take turns drawing pieces from the bag until all pieces are taken. If a player already has a King, they re-draw.

Play alternates between turns of Diplomacy and Match Phases.

Diplomacy 
Players holding a King are Superpowers. Superpowers seek an Ally from the other players to commit their pieces during the Match using Diplomacy. Players that are neither Superpowers nor Allies are Hosts.

Match 
Superpowers face each other and commit up to four of their pieces including their King. Allies decide to commit and add any of their pieces to either side.

Kings and Pawns have no value. Queens are worth two. All other pieces are worth one.

The side with the higher value wins.

The losing Superpower surrenders a random piece to the winner. On a Draw the Hosts win and they draw from either side until each host has a piece.

Victory is declared when one player has both Kings or after ten turns. After ten turns, Kings and Pawns are counted as 1 point each. The highest total wins, or the status quo preserved.

# Harvest Festival
```
An island in the Aegean Sea. King Paramonos holds his Court during the harvest festival. There are counselors, guards, musicians, heroes, slaves, astrologists, daughters, sons, wives... all cursed with pride and passion.

Players, which one are you? What are you known for? Which secret AMBITION are you ready to die for: love, power, glory?

Take five index cards and write a MISTAKE on each: a lie, an insult, a blow, an oath, a threat.
Flip and shuffle the cards. Write a FATE on each: murderer, traitor, lover, king, outcast.

Take turns to tell what your character do and say to fulfill his/her AMBITION. If it seems risky or uncertain, invoke the Chorus: all other players must loudly argue of the character's virtues, of the laws of Fate, and decide together what the consequences will be.

* Once you revealed to someone what your AMBITION is, he/she will say who opposes you. Draw a card. Hold it so that you can only see the MISTAKE, while the other players see your FATE.
* Once you have made your MISTAKE, turn your card and learn what your FATE will be.

Take your time. Play until each character has met his/her FATE.

# Going 'neath
```
Look up: the True Humans and their servants went there, uncounted ages past. They never returned.

Look around: ramshackle villages, rusting keeps, observatories, cracked walls, and rolling heaths covering an immense labyrinth.

Below is the 'neath. No levels, no depths; winding everywhere, joining everyplace. The underworld, porous, immediate.

PREPARE
Arms & Armour: fight, overcome physical challenges, Persist 6
Subtlety & Stealth: pass undetected, defeat locks and barriers, Persist 5
Study & Search: detect secrets, unlock puzzles, summon arcane powers, Persist 5

HOW HARD?
Tough: 7+
Daunting: 9+
Terrible: 11+
Roll two dice, meet or exceed the number. Roll one more die and take the best for preparation.

PERSISTENCE
You're hurt, lost, terrified, confused. Roll a die. If you roll under Persist, you stand; deduct 1. If you roll over, you falter and attempt to flee. If you cannot flee, you may die, or be permanently lost.
Rest in safe places and regain Persist. If physically wounded, deduct 1 Persist until healed.

MOST THINGS, YOU CAN ONLY DRIVE OFF
Nithers
Scallydorfs
Skulkers
Lurkers
Witchspiders
Strangleggers

FINDING
1: dust and shadows
2-3: feature, obstacle
4: hostilities
5: negotiation
6: wonder

# Ye good old days
```
You are rusty, retired superheroes. Lusty, slightly senile and alcoholic. None of you really remember which had the flying carpet and who could magically bend fire. 

You have two stats. "senior" and "alcoholic". The total value of both is 6 distributed as you see fit. The allotment might change on the whim of the GM. Also, with a tale of how it all was better in the good old days you can swap a stat-point from alcoholic to senior. And vice versa by drinking (in-game) a lot of alcohol.

When in doubt, roll under the according stat. You can always give yourself advantage by consuming a Schnaps (ca. 40 vol.).

Before the game commences each attendee fills eight chits with each one of the following:

- Ability (Skill, Super-Power, Godly Gift, ...)

- Equipment (Invisibility Gun, Magic Hat, Flying Saucer, ...)

- Person (Friend, Sidekick, Butler, ...)

- Place (Secret Layer, Helpful Shop, ...)

All of the above go into a hat, wherefrom the GM draws a handful to craft a story.

All players might earn the right to draw a chit by consuming a beer (ca. 5 vol.) whereupon their characters remember that they were the ones with the respective asset.

Be brave, drink on. 
Slainte! 
```
<hr>

# Something Like Bucko
```
You discover a discarded nickname on the side of the road. It sounds something like "bucko." It's well-loved, but no longer fits its person. You try it on: strange, but comfortable. You feel like someone else.

Each player writes three nicknames on papers; shuffle them in a large mug. One player says, "I found a nickname on the way here." They draw a nickname, say the first feelings they think of, and wear it--not just the name, but the love and hate within it. They don't know who it belonged to, just its feelings and memories. They tell the rest of story of arriving here, wearing these new experiences.

Another player asks to try it on. They describe new feeling and memories from the nickname. Players, in turn, try on the name and share its history. Players invent these experiences, but must relate them back to the name. Only refer to the nicknamed player by the nickname.

Consider the feeling of being called something you didn't ask for, compared to your name and things you've been called, with their own feelings and memories. Players exchange playing the role of this name and, maybe by the end, someone keeps it.
```
<hr>

# The Will of All
```
Heist the jewels. Escape the haunted house. Win the regatta. Deliver the intel. 

Succeed together. Fail alone.

Choose a Game Steward to predetermine (number of players x 3) obstacles, decide whether actions are applicable, and set the difficulty threshold for die rolls.

Gather (number of players + 1) d10s into a shared resource pool. 

Each player declares three actions their character can always do.

The Steward presents obstacles narratively and sequentially.

Any player may overcome an obstacle by doing one of their declared actions, if directly applicable. If multiple players can overcome an obstacle this way, they may do so together.

Any player with an indirectly applicable action may spend a die from the resource pool to try to improvise a solution. To succeed, the resource die must be rolled accordingly: "That should work" - 1 or higher, "That might work" - 4 or higher, "That seems far-fetched" - 7 or higher. The die starts at zero.

A die is added to the resource pool whenever all players overcome the same number of obstacles.

The game ends when the players cannot overcome an obstacle or there are no obstacles left. If there are no obstacles left, the player who overcame the most obstacles wins.
```
<hr>

# Love Interest
```
You've just saved the world, all there is to do now is find a partner and settle down.

One player is the Love Interest, everyone else is a suitor.

Suitors have a name and 3 confessions in the form "People think I'm ___, but really I'm ___"

One at a time, the Suitors take the Love Interest out. 

The Suitors each plan a date with the love interest. A date includes

A meeting
A cute happening
A confession

The love interest is not a character. Instead, as dates happen, characteristics will be applied to them. If a date has them at the gym, they might be fit, but the next date might contradict that by having the Love Interest do unfit things.  

If there are three contradictions, the Love Interest wins.


The Love Interest baits contradictions, the active Suitor tries to move the date to the Confession, and the other Suitors ask questions to flesh out details. Once per date each other Suitor may possess the Love Interest to make them say or do something.

After everyone confesses, the next set of scenes is performed.
After the suitors have each confessed three times the Love Interest picks a winner.

# Armageddon, Arms, and Armor
```
Players will each command a tank, which are uniquely designed by them and which are grouped into 3 categories:

Light- fast and reliable with a crew of 3 
Medium- good armor and speed with a crew 4
heavy- good armor and penetration with a crew of 4-5

These will be the starting Chassis with which the players will build their tanks.

The stats are:

Side armor 
Front armor
Penetration (will damage HP if higher than armor of target)
Speed (how spaces the can move)
Communication (How well they can relay locations of enemies, good if a player has low optics)
Optics (determines along with a role who spots the enemy)
camouflage ("stealth" basically only for ambushes)
Reliability (Determines severity of critical fails, like if your tank burst into flames) 




A light tank starts with:

SA 2
FA 4
Penetration 4
Speed 8
Communication 5
Optics 6
camouflage 6
Reliability 6 

Medium:

SA  4
FA  6
Pn  5
Sp  5
Com 5
OP  4 
Cam 4
Rel 4

Heavy:

SA  6
FA  8
Pn  8
Sp  4
Com 4
OP  4 
Cam 2
Rel 4 

Players have 12 points they may use to add onto any stat on their tanks.

# Spelling Sorcerers
```
Players are Sorcerers chanting spells around a cauldron, to enchant a delicious or powerful item, such as the last snack in a packet or the last drams of a fancy drink.

The Sorcerer who contributes most to the enchantment wins it, however: each Sorcerer must not commit any magic taboos.

Sorcerers gather at a table or circle, and begin by uttering a Spell, (after writing it down and hiding it from themselves) which becomes their Magic Name.

The Sorcerer with the longest Name begins by uttering a spell. Before five seconds pass, the player to their left does too. 
Play continues widdershins until only one unbanished Sorcerer remains, who correctly recites their magic name, in order to finish the enchantment. If they cannot, Banished sorcerers return, and play continues as before.

If, during enchantment, a Sorcerer pauses or utters an invalid Spell, someone may accuse them of committing magic taboo.

After up to a minute of debate, the circle must come to a consensus, voting to annul the charges, Banish the defendant, or Banish the accuser for defamation; Banished players may not contribute to enchantment.

(A Spell is a contiguous sequence of phonemes that contain nothing previously said by anyone)

# Hanging like pigs
```
The war is over and a fascist officer has time to think before being hanged.
This is a two players game in which you are required to describe a situation, not the event itself.

Draw a circle in the centre of a white sheet, this will become the symbol of your fascism.
---
Victim: use a question from each list to set the scene, which must outline: where it is happening, who is the victim, what did they hope for (first list) and what is going to happen (second list).
Draw a new part of the symbol.

- When did you start believing in fascism?
- Why did you vote for them?
- How did you support the party?
- Why did you think the war was right?

Fascist: end the scene explaining how you, your soldiers and the victim got there and why, for the first time, you thought it was:

- necessary to silence a dissident
- imperative to kill
- important to execute a child
- right to rape

and you didn't prevent it.

Stain the symbol with drawings inspired by the scene.
---
Exchange roles, mark the used questions and continue till the last.
The fascists are hanged asking themselves: Was it worth it?

# IZomby
```
iZomby is the hottest tween zombie show on the Bisney Channel.  You are zombie extras.  You are also actual zombies.  Today's shoot is running long and you need lunch.  If you don't find some brains soon, there's going to be trouble.

Characteristics:
1: Cute
2: Strong
3: Unassuming
4: Gossip
5: Fast
6: Ate Large Breakfast

For the ZM:  What options your players have for "lunch" are up to you, but here are some suggestions.  Any option should have pros and cons.

# Ghost of a Chance
```
You are ghosts haunting the old Jenkins mansion.

Good news! Some local kids have planned a seance with an actual medium!  They can allow you to unburden your soul and escape purgatory.

Bad news! The kids got bored and are having a party instead...and it's a rager!

You have six hours until sunrise to find the medium or you're stuck for another year.  There are Obstacles.  Fortunately, you have Ghost Powers to help you.  Each costs 1 Ghost Point to use.  Each ghost has 6 Ghost Points.

Ghost Powers:
Banshee Wail: You can scream across the veil (it's very scary).

Possession: You can take over a person, but you're subject to their level of intoxication. Costs zero point to use if they're unconscious, but you can't move or speak.

Orb: You can make a ball of light.

Poltergeist: You can throw stuff around.

Gremlin: You can break machines.


Obstacles:
Glow Stick Dancers: Easily distracted and flailing.

Cuddle Puddle: Easy to get in, hard to get out.

Keg Standers: CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!

Technicolor Pachyderms: They flock around the heavily intoxicated and get in your way.

Goth Kids: Look like mediums, but they can't hear you.


Good luck and good haunting!

# The Dream Thieves
```
Kiesha is asleep, and having a nightmare.  You, her loyal Dream Thieves, are sworn to help bring her peace.  But in so doing, you must preserve her dream's purpose -- as a lesson, portent, etc.

Vision Phase
Take turns describing something about the dream, saying one sentence and passing to the right, until everyone has a vivid picture, and there is a clear, present problem for the Thieves to solve.  Describe the dream through the lens of hyperbole, symbolism, surrealism, and emotion.

Thief Phase
Describe what you change, in the dream world or otherwise, to address the problem, partially or completely, then ask the player to your right a loaded question about your actions: "Why does this confuse Kiesha?"  "What does Kiesha portend now?" "Why do I stop just short?"  Assume the Thief's action works as intended.  If the answer leaves no problem, start another Vision Phase, starting with the player on the answerer's right.  When finished, the player to the Thief's left starts a new Thief Phase.

Once everyone has taken at least one Thief Phase, anyone may call an end to the dream by saying how they wake Kiesha in their Thief Phase.  How does she greet the day?

If you flip a major arcana card, the player adds an interesting twist to the situation regardless of success or failure. "The Fool" counts as a critical failure-describe how your character gains new knowledge as a result of the fail. "The World" counts as a critical success-describe how you and your allies all benefit.
