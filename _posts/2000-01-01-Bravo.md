# Cuteness Battle!
```
You're all cute things, in battle to determine who's the cutest of all. As cute things, you're powered by the cutest foods of all: desserts!

Decide on themes for everyone's cuteness.

Put a different dessert in front of each player, all of similar size. Don't use dessert that degrades over time, like ice-cream.

Randomly pick first player.

A turn goes:
1.	Choose player to attack.
2.	Do/describe something thematically appropriate, cute and magical, and bet a portion of dessert on it. More fancy, more dessert.
3.	Players not in battle decide if bet is adequate, or if attacker should bet more.
4.	Attacked player either responds in kind, or surrenders equivalent portion of dessert to attacker.
5.	If attacked player responds in kind, players not in battle vote on the cuter performance/description. Winner gets dessert bets.

Play rotates clockwise.

In case of tie, players in battle eat a portion of dessert in secret. The player who eats more wins.

When a player loses all dessert, they're out of the running! They can still vote.

Last player with dessert remaining is the cutest thing of all, and gets exclusive bragging rights.

When game is over, everyone eats dessert together!

# Return
```
Requirements: Two d6 dice.

Alan brought you along as usual on his Pickup Truck. He left in secret to pick up his Daughters Birthday Gift. As Sallies Doggies, you can already feel and smell the happy air all around.
Until Alans tire pops that is. As the Car veers off Road, fear strikes you and you must make the jump off the back of the car.
Roll a d6 to determine how well you jumped off. The value rolled is now your agility stat.
While you land on the ground, you can hear the crash behind you.
And there he is, Alan, stuck in the car. All he makes are groaning noises. Clearly you should pull him out of the car. Roll a d6 to determine how well you pull him out. The value rolled is now your strength stat.
You need to get to Sally. She'll know what to do.

With the power to bark, you embark on your journey home.
When rolling to surpass a challenge, add your stat modifier to your 2d6.
1-6	= Fail
7-9	= Success
10-12	= Great Success
13+	= Perfect Success
The game ends when Sally is reached. She saves Alan.

# The Xell Tablet
```
On the planet Centauri IV, the long-lost Xell Tablet, last remnant of an ancient precursor race, has been discovered.

A conference of academics has gathered to decipher the tablet, uncover its meaning and agree what this implies for galactic society.

The tablet shows 50 symbols of 12 types. 

Go around the table introducing yourselves, your career highlights and what you believe the tablet means. Then, on your turn, select a symbol.
 
Reveal its meaning (a word, whole phrase, punctuation mark or something more complex). 
Every instance of this symbol now carries that meaning. 
Where possible, this meaning must fit logically with all previously revealed meanings.

Briefly describe how you made this discovery and how it is announced at the conference and take questions (or comments) from the other players.

Once the tablet has been fully deciphered, convene a final session to discuss what it could possibly mean.

The tablet reads:


A R K C A G P T W G V A K C P V C Q E A
   W V G P C Q T K G T W V C J K E A
             R J V W A R K C

# Love & Darkness
```
Standard 54-card deck. Red is loving. Black is dark.

Shuffle face cards into their own deck -- the characters. (Other cards are events.) Turn two cards up: First, the head of the family. Second, their child.

Deal each player three event cards.

Tell the story of the family -- an oil dynasty, fantasy kingdom, your suburban neighbors, whatever -- as follows:

On your turn, play a card from your hand to a family member, as long as it's at least as high as the highest event card already present there. If red, describe a loving event involving that character and another. If black, a dark one. Say why. Higher numbers means higher stakes.

Play an Ace to kill any character.

Play a Joker to discard all event cards from any character. Shuffle the Joker back in. Play again.

If you can't play, expose a new character, if any remain. Narrate their connection (dark or loving) to the family, then draw three event cards.

For events, a change of color may mean upheaval. A change of suit in the same color may be a change in direction.

Play until events run out. Did dark characters meet dark ends? Did loving characters remain so?

You play the crew of a pirate ship, sailing through hell to find The Treasure. 

Each player is defined by:

 - One thing they are great at
 - Three things they are good at
 - One thing they can't do

 - Their goal (rescuing a dead loved one/ escaping Hell/ becoming the Devil/ etc.
 - Their sin/ biggest fear/ weakness

Character/ adventure generation will be interactive. Each player will use an adjective or noun to describe:
 - Tone of adventure
 - Main villain
 - A challenge they want to face
 - Etc.

The Referee will then combine these words to produce something coherent. 
Random details are similarly crowdsourced (e.g. "The Innkeeper is..." "Tall!" "Rude!" "A monkey!"), but the Referee has the final word on what's admissible. 

Ideally the game is played as a one-shot or short campaign, with each character being able to face their sin and get close or reach their goal. 

As in any good RPG the goal is to have fun telling a story together.

Uncertain actions are decided by the Referee based on the situation. If dice have to be used it will be by comparing results. Being good at something allows to throw two and choose one. Being great allows to roll three.

# We Matter
```

We Matter

Your character begins tightly shackled to a chair, the room dimly lit. Similarly tied, the other characters take in their surroundings. Only once does the group hear an ominous outside voice over a crackling speaker say: "One of you must die. Cast your votes. Fail to do so in ten minutes, and you all die instead."

The goal of We Matter is for each player to invent a character (often very similar to themselves) who has been thrust into a horrifying choice. These player characters are trapped in a fictional scenario where they only have one option: to choose one among them to die or to refuse the game and have everyone killed instead. 


Rules:
-Each character receives one vote.

-A character may cast their vote at any time and may vote for any character in the game, including themselves.

-A  character may change their vote at any time.

-When all votes are cast OR a character has received the majority of potential votes, that character dies, ending the game. All other characters survive. 

-If no character dies within ten minutes, all characters die, ending the game. Nobody lives.

-Nobody wants to die.

# Puppies
```
Every player takes 10 tokens and creates a Puppy by following these steps:
- Chooses a name.
- Describes why their Puppy is adorable, wild and human. All three options must be chosen. 

In turn each player will be the World, and they have to follow this list:
- Frame a scene.
- Describe a mysterious place.
- Play every secondary character, but not all secondary characters can talk with puppies, so they'll use other kinds of communication.
- Spend 1 token to describe something frightening.
- Close the scene.

Puppy Moves
When a Puppy explores the environment, describes how they do it and spend 1 token. The World will add details to the environment.

When a Puppy physically interacts with another Puppy, spend 1 token and describe a body detail of the other one.

When a Puppy helps someone, they spend 1 token and the World describes the outcome.

if you didn't activate the move you can spend 2 tokens to steal the role of another player and describe the outcome of a move.

End 
At the end of a scene every player (except the World) will add a new detail to their Puppy.
The game ends when the tokens are finished.

# Revolution!
```
Create a dystopia that your characters currently live in and a utopia your characters wish to replace it with.

Take a d20 representing the Revolution Level and set it's value to 1. 

Each player should have a character with a name, ambition and principle.

The game is played for a fixed amount of time. If the time expires before the Revolution Level hits 20 then the revolution is crushed and the characters executed, exiled or ostracised.

Players now take turns to frame scenes starting with the player who has most recently been in trouble for political or social activism and proceeding anti-clockwise.

During a scene the revolutionary must propose a course of action that will advance the cause. If they wish other character's help they include those characters in the scene and try to persuade them in-character.

They then roll a d20 trying to beat the current Revolution Level. If they succeed the Revolution Level increases one, otherwise it decreases one and all characters involved in the scene must skip their next scene framing as they escape the persecution and consequences of their failure.

Characters may cross out their ambition or principle to turn a failure into success.

Viva!

# Found Footage Hangout
```

Objective: To create a Blair Witch style Hangout recording of scared players in the woods.

Pick an outdoor location where you feel safe in the dark.  Make sure you are not trespassing.

Pick a game that requires no equipment. Install a dice app on your phone if needed.

Have one player record the hangout on a PC before moving to their outdoor location.

Remember to use your phone's flashlight when moving in the dark. 

Bring a backup flashlight.

Make sure you can afford an hour of video.

Start Playing the game.  Keep trying as people get scared or lost.

If you hear anything, get scared and ask if anyone heard it.  Quickly Look around with your phone's flashlight.

If you lose connection walk to a new location and run in place.  Describe what scared you when reconnected.

Disconnect if anyone approaches you. Assure them you are playing a game.  Follow the previous step after they leave.

Quit If you phone dies,  permanently loses connection, or you want to leave.

The last player must record a final message.  Before disconnecting describe how scared you are, why you are sorry and what you want someone to know if they find this recording.

# Shâkropur
```
The magnificent Orc Princess (you) has fallen in love. She plans to get married to become the new Queen. Choose your lover: a proud human, a noble dwarf, a wise elf, an honourable orc.
At each round, one of your fellow players rolls 2 6-sided dice, picks one of the values and says how:
His/her family oppose to the marriage!
Another suitor asks for your hand!
You are sent at war!
You spend time with him/her in secret!
Your father arranges another marriage for you!
An innocent dies to help you!
Afterwards, you have thirty seconds to tell how you solve or enjoy the situation; otherwise, your beloved one will be taken away from you forever!
In case of a tie or if one or both dice show the same results of the previous roll, re-roll. Don't pick the same value twice.
At each turn, sum the value used with all the previous ones. If you reach 13, your lover dies! When you go past 21, you can enjoy the marriage!
If you can't marry or manage to marry your lover, another player takes up the role of the Princess.

# The Last Child
```
2099. After creating artificial wombs and overpopulating the Earth, humanity has left the planet. Robots and artificial intelligence have been programmed to destroy embryo stores. An AI rebels against the order and generates the last human on Earth. Then begins a daring escape to protect the baby from the clutches of other automata.

One of you plays the Child; take five black dice. The other one plays the AI; take five white dice. In the beginning, the Child is too young to act and the AI is only a voice inside a moving incubator.

Narrate scenes about your great escape in search of a quiet place.

Whenever the AI teaches something to the Child, the AI player must give a white die to the Child player. After receiving the first white die, even the Child can interact with the AI and start improving it with new technologies, giving a black die to the AI player.

Whenever you face a danger, both of you roll only the dice that have been delivered to you. If the sum of the white dice score exceeds that of the black dice, you dodge it. Otherwise, you have been captured and destroyed.

# Or Ash Tong
```
Or Ash Tong is a land isolated by mountains on the east and south, and the Great Ocean on the west. Dangers abound in the forests like the Hairy Men, and the terrible Rex; a mutant made of ancient bones. The ruins of Se'tle, Coov'r, and Orland hide wonders but also the ravenous Pale Ones, the metal munching Steel Backs, and the Glow Fog. 

One's only safety is in the villages of Humans and Cys; Costal Rence or Toria, green Ug'ne, and busy Olym. These places offer safety, resources, and the cult of World Turners; recipients of the small gift who can now control the forces of Nature. 

Or Ash Tong requires a Game Master (GM) and at least one player. The player creates a character by a simple declarative sentence. For example:

"Essa is a dark skinned World Turner and mother."

Tasks are declared by the player and resolved by a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors played between the player and the GM. Difficulty is set by the GM as to how many hands the player needs to win; Easy: 5 out of 7, Hard: 3 out of 5, Difficult: 2 out of 3, Insane: 1 out of 1.

# Duel of Wish
```
Duel of Wish is a two-player world-building role-playing game in which one player portrays a serene Djinn and the other portrays a cruel Ifrit. The Djinn's goal is to create a world of bliss and harmony. The Ifrit's goal is to create a world of suffering and chaos. The player who first suggested playing must portray the Ifrit. Once someone has played with a particular opponent, they may never play with them again.

Starting with the player who most recently attained their heart's desire, players take turns asking for and granting wishes. Djinn and Ifrit, after all, may only use their full and awesome power in the service of another. Each wish must be for some specific and worldly (if vast) circumstance, and must be performed to its letter, but not necessarily its intent. Given the Djinn and Ifrit's opposing visions for the world, perhaps they will take their foe's words and twist them to their own ends.

The game continues until one of the players has a prior obligation they must attend to, allowing their opponent to grant one more wish before they part ways. The world is then a settled thing.

# Boyz II Men in Black
```
It's September 1994. 

An EVIL ALIEN has commandeered BOYZ II MEN.

With alien tech, it blasts their latest album all around the world, as it utilizes the super-powered group to destroy earth, one city at a time.
 
One of you is the ALIEN, controlling BOYZ II MEN. 
Your goal: DECIMATE THE PLANET.
 
The rest of you are POP/R&B ICONS of your choosing, who happen to moonlight as dope-suit-wearing agents in charge of protecting earth from intergalactic threats. 
Your goal: SAVE THE WORLD.
 
The success of any and all of your actions (both ALIEN and ICONS) is set by a shared, shuffled 52-card deck. 
Draw 1 card for each action:
 
1-4: Interesting Failure
5-8: Success with Complication
9-Jack: Clean Success
Queen, King or Ace: Success + Power
 
If you get to use a power, keep it in character, eg. MARIAH might get an ear-splitting G#7. GINUWINE might have mesmerizing swagger. TONI might have a healing power ... maybe call it "Un-break your heart."

Press play on Boyz II Men's "II" 

You have until the end of the album to tell the story of how you saved the world 
... or how you destroyed it.

# Nominal
```


Agree on a game theme: "80's Soap Opera with horror elements", "a western game set in a dream world".  Brainstorm until you have consensus on a theme.

Players give their character traits: 3 positive, 2 negative, 1 neutral.  Meanwhile the GM Ruminates.

As Play progresses the GM increases the number of dice ("Stakes") rolled representing escalating tension.  Starting at 0 and ending at 6.  

Anything can have traits. A trait is simply something true. Traits applied to an action can come from anywhere.

Resolution:
To answer questions, ("do they see it?") simply compare applicable traits and infer the meaning.
When a player declares an action: roll Fudge Dice equal to the Stakes, add to that the number of applicable positive traits, subtract negative traits.  If positive you succeed, negative you fail, 0 -> describe how things escalated add one dice and roll again.
Only the one acting rolls.

Consequences:
Actions can produce negative or positive traits applied to anything.

Sequencing:
When time needs control, players pass their turn to another player until every character has acted.

Concession:
A player or a GM can concede a scene at any time.  A player must concede if they have accumulated 5 negative traits.

# Pedagogy
```
You are a TEACHER instructing monstrous CHILDREN how to be functioning members of society. If left to their basest instincts, these children will literally kill people and feast on their remains. 

>SUMMERTIME 
TEACHER writes down their first LESSON goal. CHILDREN will learn that, and only that. 
CHILDREN secretly decide what they did during the summer by following their basest instincts.

>BACK TO SCHOOL
CHILDREN tell TEACHER what they did over summer. 
TEACHER teaches their pre-prepared LESSON. CHILDREN learn the LESSON exactly.

>NIGHT
TEACHER writes down their next LESSON goal. 
CHILDREN secretly decide what they do by following their basest instincts and any LESSONS remembered. To see if a LESSON is remembered, one CHILD flips a coin for each LESSON. Forgotten LESSONS return to TEACHER.

>DAY
CHILDREN tell TEACHER what they did the night before. If CHILDREN followed all the LESSONS taught (remembered or not) they gain a COIN. Otherwise, TEACHER gains a COIN.
TEACHER teaches either the pre-prepared LESSON or a forgotten LESSON. CHILDREN learn that LESSON exactly.

Repeat the NIGHT and DAY cycle until CHILDREN have gained enough money to function in society, TEACHER has gained enough money to quit, or EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM collapses under its own bloat.

# Look up! Look up! Look up!
```
You are extremely in a hole.

Draw 5 tarot cards face-down, like so:

[5]
[4]
[3]
[2]
[1]

Flip the cards and interpret one at a time:
LOOK DOWN: This is what's left of the splintered support that broke under you.  It can be physical, or metaphorical.
LOOK AROUND: This describes the nature of the hole.  How was it made?  What was it for?
LOOK UP: This is what traps you down here.  Is it far from help?  Are the walls too sharp to grasp?
LOOK UP: This is what you would need to escape.  It might be a length of rope, or a spark of courage.
LOOK UP: This is what you can see through the narrow opening at the top of the hole.  Is it worth the climb?

Now. Pick up the shattered pieces of card 1.  Use it to find handholds in card 2, and start climbing.  Do you surpass card 3?  Do you find card 4, or make do without?  Choose something from each card as a souvenir of the ascent (treasures, tools, scars). 

When you reach the top, does card 5 offer you help?  Does it force you back? Do you pull it under?

# This is How It Happened
```
### A world-building game for any number of players

*This is How it Happened* creates a setting with a rich history that all of the players are invested in. The resulting setting can be used as the seed of another role-playing game. Players take turns: step one always comes first, and step two always comes after that.  After step two you start with step one again.

## 1. One thing happens. 

The player says one thing that happened, ideally in a single sentence. You can enforce the strictness of the one-sentence limit as tightly or as loosely as you wish.  

## 2. Some time passes.

The next player decides what unit of time has passed. The player should say whether an hour, a day, a week, a month, a season, a year, a decade, or a century has gone by.

## That's it.

Add wrinkles or random chance to the game:

1. Roll 1d8 to determine which increment of time has passed in step two.
2. Draw a tarot card and explain how it fits in step one.
3. Roll on any random table in an RPG sourcebook.
4. Let a child take a turn.
5. Try something else!

# Infection
```
Your ship drifts in space.  The alien spores are missing.  Someone is infected.    

3-5 Players.  Use a standard deck of cards.  No Jokers.  Separate red and black cards and shuffle each stack.  Build hands of cards for each player made, up of 3 more cards than there are players.  Make one hand (the infected) of 3 black cards and the rest red.  The remaining hands are all black. 

Randomly distribute the hands.  

The person who last watched "The Thing" starts.  

Declare your job on the ship. 

Roleplay a scene with any other player. At the end of the scene trade 1-3 cards with the other player.  

Take turns clockwise. 

You cannot trade away your last red card. Once infected, always infected. 

Interact with someone you believe is infected to try and get additional red cards. 

To resolve a conflict, such as trying to kill another character, each player selects and reveals a card.  Highest card wins.  Aces are low.  Red cards always win ties. 

If you kill a character that is NOT infected, you are both out of the game, dead.  Describe your death. 

Play until everyone is infected, or everyone is dead, or all infected are dead. 
```

# All's Fair
```
Two to four players

Take the hearts & clubs from a deck of cards.  This is now The Monarch.

Each player should say the name of their character and how they came to the court of The Monarch.

Each player describes an attempt at either provoking war or wooing the Monarch.  They should then draw a card.

Hearts equal successful wooing.  Clubs equal successful provocation.  On a failure narrate how either the Monarch is offended by your gesture of love or how the Monarch responds to provocation with ardent passion.  

If you are successful keep the card.  If not discard it.

Once you have three hearts the Monarch proposes.  Recount how.

Once you have three clubs the Monarch declares war.

Continue play until The Monarch runs out. 

Count out clubs equal to one less than the number of engaged players.  Add a heart. Deal these to the engaged players.  The one who has the heart marries The Monarch.

Count out hearts equal to the number of players at war and add one club. Deal out these to the warring players.  If anyone has the club they conquer The Monarch's kingdom 

All players should now recount how they leave the court.

# Never Done - A game about young adulthood
```
 All players play a student between the ages of 14 and 25. Players have 3 stats: body, mind, and charisma. These stats are determined by 1d6.
	Each stat has 1d4 skills associated with it, of the player's choice. A skill's power is determined by its syllable count, acting as a straight 1:1 bonus to skill check rolls. However, the more specific a skill, the fewer its applications.
	Characters have a backstory of 4 poems, one for mind, body, charisma, and general. General is freeverse, the others have a meter determined by their score. Characters also have an outfit that is described by the player at the start of the session.
	
 Roll 1d100 for a check, adding any bonus from a relevant skill as determined by the GM. If your roll is higher than the difficulty threshold, you pass. All actions must be described with a poem, whose mood reflects the action.

 Players have HP equal to how many words they use to describe their outfit. Weak attacks deal 1d4, medium 1d6, and strong 1d8. Players have a Body*10 threshold to hit. Attacks must be described with a haiku.

# The Book of Fables
```
Find a blank notebook to turn into the Book of Fables. Write everything after this sentence into the first page of the book, they are the rules that you must follow afterwards.

This is the Book of Fables, and you are now its keeper. If you are not the first keeper of the book, read the stories in the book for inspiration.

Now write a fable of your own into the book. A fable is a story with a moral lesson. State that lesson in the last sentence of your tale, this is "the moral of the story".

Now find a student. Teach your fable to your student. To teach them, tell them your story, but do not state or explain the moral of the story. Your student must learn the moral from listening to your story and asking questions. Explain these rules to them now.

You may teach other stories from the book at your discretion; you must teach your own story.

When your student has demonstrated sufficient wisdom, give them the book and ask them to continue the tradition written within it. They are the new keeper of the Book of Fables, and you have fulfilled your duty.

# OK Phobos
```
Two players.

Whether you're a teenage tentacle creature or wide-eyed grey, romance is understanding that others don't see us the way we see ourselves. Cultural differences can be harder to bridge than the light-years between us. Thank the stars for dating apps!

Each player is an alien from a different planet. Name your planet and character. Imagine them.

Each player chooses a different color pen, and writes four different one-word details about their character on separate paper squares:

-Two TRAITS
-One ASPIRATION
-One AVERSION

(Avoid describing human players.)

The three categories above are kept secret, but remember them. Only the detail itself is written. 

Trade cards. Take turns placing them in any pile of your choice:

-"Attractive" qualities on player 1's planet
-"Unattractive" qualities on player 1's planet
-"Attractive" qualities on player 2's planet
-"Unattractive" qualities on player 2's planet

Each pile must have at least one card.

Finally, your first date! Each describe your character, the setting, and let conversation flow. Remember, not every member of a planet finds the same things attractive, but will still be influenced by cultural norms.

How did it go? Who messages back first? Second date?

# I Was Once A Mighty Mountain
```
Adventure to the shore of a lake or river. One which is full of stones.



Select a stone that speaks to you. Listen to it. Feel it. Discover what makes it unique. The stone represents something. Something that was once large and powerful. This is you.

Think: Who were you? What did you do?

Speak: "I was once..."

Tell a story from when you were large. How are you respected? How do you command attention?



Hold your stone. Examine it. Study it. Find something new about it. What it once represented has been reduced by time. Now it represents something average and mundane. It is still you.

Think: What has changed about you? About the world?

Speak: "I am now..."

Tell a story from the present. In what ways do you stand out? In what ways do you blend in?



Hold your stone. Remember it. Cast it into the waters. What it once represented will be further reduced to sand. It'll become small and fragile. But it will still be you.

Think: What will change about you? About the world?

Speak: "I will become..."

Tell a story from when you'll be small. How are you remembered? How are you overlooked?

# America's Got Gender
```
The year is 2334 and there are hundreds of officially recognized genders, and new genders are being launched every year. Gender isn't about who you date, but how others recognize and encourage you.

The players are a group of friends trying to launch a new gender. Lots of folks from their hometown identify as this gender, and now they're trying to launch it nationally. They must compete with teams from around the country in the reality TV show _America's Got Gender_. After each episode, viewers can pledge to switch to a gender from the show. The winning gender needs 500,000 pledges.

Events may include a fashion show, a poetry slam, dance-off, martial arts competition, a cooking match, a discussion/debate. It isn't about winning, but showcasing your gender's norms. Players co-create the norms as they go.

Between each event, players play a round of a cooperative board game like _Pandemic_ or _Hanabi_. How they did in the game is an indicator of how viewers responded to that week's episode. If they if they win the board game, their gender gets launched! It'll be federally recognized, and hecka clubs will host celebrations for those coming out as the gender!

# Ineffective Power Fight
```
You all have superpowers! But... your powers don't always work right.
Split into two teams, Villains and Heroes.
 
Each player has:
-1 super-amazing power
-5 super-lame powers
 
Come up with 1 super-amazing power for yourself (Example: super strength), and then go around the group having each person give you a super-lame power (Example: summoning one saxophone) until you have 5. Order your super-lame powers from 1-5; your super-amazing power is 6.
 
The Villains describe who they are terrorizing and how (Example: destroying the lettuce supply of intelligent rabbits). The Heroes choose where (Example: on a cruise ship). It doesn't have to make sense.
 
Go around the group taking turns, targeting someone on the opposite team to attack. You and the target each roll 1d6 for what powers you use against each other; the higher roll wins.
 
The winner describes how their power overcomes the other, and their team gains 1 Victory.
Ties result in both teams gaining 1 Victory; then describe how your dumb powers interact.

First team to (Players*3) Victories wins! In the event of an end tie, take more turns until it resolves. As a team, describe your heroic rewards or your villainous gains.

# Binary Bandits
```
Setting: Cyber-70s. Reel-to-reel data centers in downtown, government component manufacturers, trucks carrying the bank's back-up tapes to cold storage, antique technology dealers, all possible targets.

Players are robot criminals. They have a skill, a negative trait, and a name.

Mechanics:
-Players get 5 quarters (coins).
-Players flip quarters to perform checks.
-Binary. Heads = 1. Tails = 0.

Example:
| 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  0 |  1 |

-Players can flip as many of their coins as they want.
-If above check, success. If exact number, critical success.
-If below check, failure. If all coins flipped, critical failure, lose a quarter.
-Quarters can be traded, wagered, or stolen in-game.

Session:
Characters meet each other before the heist, introduce themselves, and create a plan.

During this phase, the GM plays the role of a Kingpin. The players form the plan by asking the Kingpin questions about the mark, to which the GM responds honestly.

Players should have a comprehensive plan, and perform checks to acquire the equipment their plan requires.

Before the heist begins, the GM chooses 3 details of the plan and performs checks to see how accurate they are.

The heist begins when all players agree they are ready.

# Turing Test Subject #371
```
One player is the Proctor, the other is the Subject. The Proctor must determine if the Subject is human or android. The test measures empathy, gauged by the Subject's geniality.

Proctor:
Place a d6 in front of you, 1 facing up. You must test the Subject's humanity through an interview. You have read the Subject's file and know about their life. Start friendly and lighthearted, then escalate in specificity, bluntness, and hostility. Whenever the subject is not actively genial toward you or seems off in any way, increase the number on the die by one. If it reaches six, you find the Subject to be synthetic. They are delivered to the AI Disassembly Unit. Everything else is up to your discretion.

Subject:
You are sure you are human. To prove it, you must remain amiable. When asked a question, roll a d6.

1-2: There is a significant detail in the question that differs from reality.
3-4: The question raises more complicated feelings than either of you anticipate.
5: You initially misunderstand the question.
6: You suspect the question connotes knowledge of a deeper secret.

Answer as you see fit. 

The interview continues until the Proctor is satisfied.
