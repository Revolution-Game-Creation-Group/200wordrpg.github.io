# FONT
```
You left a dying world for the perilous FISSURE; few return.  You seek the FONT, which will change everything.

In secret, record your:
-TITLE (names are forbidden)
-VISION (number from 2 [inward] to 4 [outward])
-RESOLVE (6 minus VISION)

Grandest TITLE chooses a TEST, describes it with three senses.
-Cross treacherous terrain
-Remove a hindrance
-Find something necessary
-Follow something unseen
-Confront something terrifying
-Go somewhere forbidden

Next (clockwise) player describes how all will overcome it.  All ROLL 1D6.
-ROLL under VISION to find / identify
-ROLL over VISION to empathize / withstand
-ROLL under RESOLVE to challenge / destroy
-ROLL over RESOLVE to evade / dissemble

Each describe your outcome.  If you fail, choose a MARK:
-Haunted: -1 VISION
-Afraid: -1 RESOLVE
-Broken: You may pass successes to others, but never enter the FONT
-Dead: Haunt the survivors

Proceed clockwise, choosing TESTs and resolving each once.
Survivors reach the FONT. Describe it with a single sense, and:

ROLL 1D6; describe the outcome:
-ROLL under VISION: the FONT changes the dying world
-Otherwise, the FONT changes you

ROLL again:
-ROLL under RESOLVE: reveal a great secret
-Otherwise, bury a secret forever

Each describe how you escape the FISSURE or why you stay.

# Time Noir
```
Welcome to the Prohibition. Each player interprets a cynic bastard with business to take care of. From a detective tired of crime ready to risk everything to a maid sick of her abusive boss. Decide the exact scenario with your group.

The problem is: You've already failed. Future You knows why, and they're going to help you by hiding useful items for you to find around the scene. Each player takes two 6-sided dice. Decide which represents Future You, and which represents Present You. Each player gets 3 Time Points per round.

At any moment, if your character is in the scene, you may spend one Time Point for Future You to hide something and for Present You to find it.
Roll both dice. Narrate the scene according to the results:

Future You
1-3: Somehow, you hid the wrong item.
4-6: You hid the right item.

Present You
1-3: You found the wrong item. You think it's the right item, and must find a use for it.
4-6: You found the right item.

The lower the number, the more useless the item is, and vice-versa.

After all Time Points are spent, a new round begins.

# Titans
```
What you need:
- A late night
- A quiet place
- A candle or campfire

All players will take the role of Titans, immense and ancient beings of great power. If you wish, agree on a name for your Realm, such as "The Twilight Forest" or "The Dusky Fields." The fire before you is the portal by which you observe the world of mortals. You are dying.

Starting with the player sitting to the west, identify yourselves one by one with a concept or virtue that you embody. You might be the Titan of Creativity, or the Titan of Knowledge. 

Once you have identified yourselves, take turns gazing through the portal. Tell the story of what gift you gave to mortals, what role you played in building the world. Who lives there now?

Tell the story of your greatest physical or spiritual struggle. Maybe you battled a legendary monster or tricked one of the gods. 

Continue telling tales until the fire is dead or until you have nothing more to say. Will you cling to life, watching the dying embers? Or will you surrender peacefully, knowing that your time in this world is over?

All things must come to an end.

# Fumble in the Dark
```
The goal of Fumble in the Dark is to sneak around security systems and steal the valuables unnoticed. However if you make too much noise the guards will chase you and if you get caught, it's the slammer for you!

To make your Thief spend 8 points in the 4 skills below, Minimum of 1 and Maximum of 3.

Might - Your Thief's physical prowess.
Speed - Your Thief's quickness.
Ingenuity - Your Thief's intelligence.
Conceal - Your Thief's skill at hiding things. 

When making a skill test you roll d6 equal to your skill and take the highest result. You can also make Noise to add 1 Dice to your pool of dice.

On a roll of 1-3; you fail while making 1 Noise.
On a roll of 4-5; you succeed but make 1 Noise.
On a roll of 6; you succeed.

Each Heist has a level of Noise that can be made before the alarm systems go off and the guards arrive. For a low security Heist you'll be able to get away with making a higher amount Noise. But a higher security level will have a lower amount of Noise you can make.

# A Regretful Duel
```
A game for two players and a coin

You are witnessing a regretful duel.
Each of you speaks for a duelist, though you are not them.

Answer the following about your duelist:
What is their name?
How do others refer to them? (she, they, he, Doctor, Monarch, Professor, etc.)
What do they look like?

Answer the following together:
The duelists were once very close, but something has compelled them to fight. What was it? (an unforgivable deed, an outside force, a regretful responsibility, etc.)
What weapons are being used in this duel? (ancient swords, beautiful songs, forgotten curses, etc.)

Assign one side of the coin to each of the duelists.

Flip the coin.

If your side is face up, describe how your duelist used their weapon to harm the other.
If your side is face down, recount a happy memory that both duelists shared.

Flip the coin and repeat.

The player who wins three coin tosses describes what becomes of the defeated duelist.
The other player describes how the winning duelist copes with what they've done in the time that follows.

Together, talk about a wonderful moment between the duelists that will never arrive because of what has happened here.

# Being Ogrim Stormbane
```
The arch-wizard Thelgrim the Pale has cursed legendary warrior Ogrim Stormbane! Now, curious patrons may pay 200 silver to crawl through portal beneath the seventh floor of the sorcerer's seclusium; Therein they will experience Ogrim's adventures through his senses for a time, as if they were inside his head!

Players take turns being Patrons. Someone will play Ogrim, the other players are the World. Set a timer for fifteen minutes. A Patron may only ask questions, starting with "where is Ogrim?" They may ask what they see, what Ogrim's doing, etc, and the others must answer them.

Ogrim will never die, and ultimately always triumphs. He will encounter trouble, though. Roll 2d6 for conflicts: 

2-5:  Something terrible happens
6-8:  Succeed, and something new is discovered
9-12: Ogrim is victorious!

After fifteen minutes, the Patron ejects roughly from Ogrim's mind, landing leagues away aside the Kingsroad. Patrons may take as many turns as desired. Patrons hold one after each adventure; they may use a hold to add +1 to a roll, partially narrating the outcome. If an adventure passes without Ogrim making an unassisted roll, the Patron permanently takes over Ogrim's body, and the game is over.

# Lexiconjurers
```
This game is played in rounds.  At the start of the game, one player takes the role of the Archmage for the first round.  

At the start of each round, the archmage uses a random word generator to generate (10 + number of players) each of nouns, verbs and adjectives.  The archmage then narrates a problem that the players must solve.  

Players take turns describing how they would solve the problem by creating a spell using the words generated for that round.  Each spell must be created out of one or two nouns, one or two verbs, and up to two adjectives.  Adverbs, conjunctions and punctuation may be added to the spell name for free. 

Example: "penetrate critical system" could be a spell that hacks computers.

Players act in the order of whoever comes up with an idea first.  Players acting after the first in each round cannot re-use nouns, verbs and adjectives used by earlier players.

After all players have taken their turn, the archmage chooses a winner based on who's spell would have most effectively solved the problem.  That person is the archmage next round.  First player to win three rounds wins the game.

# I do speak human
```
Your spaceship crashed on Earth. You've taken the body of an average suburban human, and you try to blend in as much as you can.

One day, a detective shows up and gather all the neighbors. He claim he research someone acting strange, like an alien.

Player : One detective, at least 3 neighbors

Cut 50 (or more) pieces of papers and write on each of them a word used often in everyday life ("Eat", "Sorry",etc...) Each neighbors pick randomly five papers, without showing them.

Take from a deck one card for each neighbors, minus one. Add to the pile the joker card. Each neighbors pick one at random, without showing it. Whoever picks the joker is the alien.

The detective will ask questions to each neighbor, about their everyday life. Each neighbor have to answer with the most normal and human answer possible. The neighbors can't talk, unless being asked. 

The alien, not used to human language, can't use any of the five words he picked, or any directly derivated (Ex: "Eat" -> "Eating" ).

The game end when the detective accuse someone to be the alien. If it is, the detective and the human win. If not, the alien win.

# Housemates
```
you are ghosts that live in the same house. it's where you died. some people live there now.

each ghost decides how they died, and in what room. another ghost talks about an important event they experienced in that room while alive. this continues until everyone has a place of death, and another memory. these are your anchors.

each ghost talks about a change the new inhabitants have made, and why it hurts. another ghost, in secret, writes down a number between one and six. that is your shadow.

after each ghost has narrated their changes, they take turns describing what power they manifest to change the house one final time. it doesn't need to relate to your anchors.

once your scenes are narrated, roll one die. another ghost may tell you to add/subtract 1, but you decide whether to accept the help. after every ghost has rolled, the shadows are revealed.

if you roll above your shadow, you pass on and your story ends. if you roll under, your shadow wins, and remorse takes your soul until the house falls, and you are forgotten. if you roll your shadow, you confront it, and choose your fate.

# You Will Destroy Something Beautiful
```
Facilitator, 1-3 players, 1d6.
 
You've come here, to this place, to destroy something beautiful. 
 
Decide on a tone together. (Epic? Mundane? Petty?)

TELL ME four things about this place.
(e.g. wretched
above the clouds
hazy
not built to human scale.)
 
TELL ME four things about the beautiful thing.
(e.g. ancient observatory
stained-glass roof
amorphous
has a guardian.)
 
Write them down. This is all that they are. I'll ask clarifying questions as we go.
 
TELL ME:
Why have you come here, destroyer?
What has this beautiful thing done, in your eyes, to deserve destruction?
Why are you cruel?
Who are you?
 
Write these four things down. This is all that you are.
 
Stretch. Get snacks. I'll play the beautiful thing. You'll play out destroying it.
 
WHEN BEAUTY RESISTS DESTRUCTION, I roll.
 
1-3: It destroys something in you. Cross an item off your list. Tell me how you're diminished. 
 
4-6: It cannot resist. Cross something off its list. I'll decide how it's diminished, then introduce a complication. 

If you run out of items, you're enthralled. Tell me how. 

If it runs out of items, congrats. Tell me: what of you survived intact? Was it worth it?

# The Hero Initiatory Journey
```
For 3 players and some d10.

The HERO is on his Journey, he starts with 2 gifts and 3 flaws, write them down.
The COMPANION follows the HERO, during the game he can help him 2 times, and can sacrifice himself once.
The ADVERSITY introduces 5 challenges one by one.


In a challenge, the HERO and the ADVERSITY both roll 1 first dice. The one with the highest dice starts the narration. Then it rotates between all the players who introduce new elements. If the HERO involves a gift, he can roll a new dice, if the adversity takes advantage of a flaw, forces the HERO to reroll his best dice.
If the COMPANION can help, he rolls a dice. The COMPANION sacrifices his life, he forces the ADVERSITY to reroll his best dice.

At the end, the FATE is the person with by the highest dice. In case of tie, the living COMPANION is the FATE, otherwise the ADVERSITY is.
The FATE decides the outcome of the challenge, if passed, remove a flaw; if failed, remove a gift.

The end of the journey is the 5th challenge; the FATE decision determines the outcome of the whole Quest.

# One Last Night Together
```
Players: at least 3
-2 opposing sides
-1 GM

"It's a cold night.  You huddle in your trench, mere meters from the enemy.  You wait for your signal to attack, but it's been a long time.  You start to talk to the humans in the other trench."

Players: Create your soldier.  Describe yourself, think about why you're here, why you fight.   Your side is a distinct faction, the enemy is another.  Decide with your allies what your faction is. Find a way to introduce yourself to the other side.  Get to know the enemy.  Share stories, drink, smoke, candy.  

GM: Keep the conversation going.  Ask questions, let the players answer them.  Don't control.  Only step in if talk is waning or stops being in-character.  Narrate occasionally.  Distant artillery.  Gentle Snowfall. 

Without warning, blow the whistle.

The players may point to their target and shout "BANG!"  If they shout and point first their target dies. GM rules who shot first (or if both die).

The player doesn't have to shoot, but will still die if shot.

Everyone: describe the aftermath.

Did you kill?  Describe the feeling.
Did you die? Describe your last moments.
GM, describe the ending scene.

# Rules Light Munchkin
```
Prep:
Each player comes up with a character. You (the GM) complete/modify their stats in the appropriate/requested system until they are balanced. Break these down into a few basic attributes, each with a tier, 0 to 3. Write down only those attributes for the players, but say verbally what they represent.

Play:
Players take turns acting, and you adjudicate with the appropriate rulebooks. If you get sick of that, instead you and each player notes the relevant attribute and rolls a die. On a maximum roll, increase tier by 1 and roll again, on a 1, subtract and roll again. Highest tier, or highest roll with equal tier, wins.

Tier/Point Cost (Optional):
0/0
1/1
2/3
3/6

EXAMPLE: 3.5 D&D

Dice: d20s

Power Tiers: Mundane, Extraordinary, Godlike, Arbitrary

Attributes:
Offense - Opposes Defense as an action. If successful, the defender can't act this combat.
Defense - Opposes Offense.
Social - For talking to people. Opposes Social.
Utility - For all other noncombat situations.

Example Bonuses/Point Cost:
Taunt/4 - As an action, make enemies only attack you this turn.
"Actually..."/1 - Once per game, say "Actually..." to get a favorable ruling or +1 tier to a roll.
```
<hr>

# The Harsh
```

Players roll a d6.  They must roll at or below their skill level to succeed. Something that causes a minor advantage/disadvantage will subtract/add 1 to the die roll, a major advantage/disadvantage will subtract/add 2 to the roll.  The DM makes the player roll against the stat that closest fits what they are trying to do and compare it to the enemy, highest degree of success wins.

All players start with a 1 in all stats (Courage, Fitness, Wisdom, Appearance, Diplomacy).  Roll a 2d6 and take the highest, distribute those points to stats.

 Players level up after three major events (Battles, diplomatic missions, etc).

Light armor provides -1 to hit, Heavy armor provides -2 to hit.

Characters take one point of damage to be mortally wounded and need medical attention or die in 1d6 minutes.  Two points of damage kills a character.

Small Weapons 1 point of damage
 Large weapons 2 points of damage

Setting: Players are characters in late 1400's Europe trying to survive.  There are no special powers or abilities and life is rarely fair.  The player can be anything such as a priest, dock master, or begger.  The world is Harsh.

# Things Speak
```
1-5 players. 2+ hours.

Follow a unique object as it's passed from person to person and discover what it sees on its journey.

When the rules say... 
CHOOSE FROM TABLES: each secretly pick one item from one table, then all reveal. Roll d6 on any unselected table.
CONSIDER: discuss together then decide.

(1) Choose object attributes from these tables:

ROLE
Heirloom
Masterpiece
Treasure
Hallowed
Taboo
Political

TYPE
Weapon
Text
Art
Wearable
Alive
Tool

QUALITY
Modest
Elegant
Subtle
Dangerous
Tainted
Enchanting

Consider what the object is. Describe it on an index card.

(2) Take turns to ask someone a question about something that happened to, or around, the object.

After the question, choose scene attributes from these tables:

EMOTION
Love
Anger
Sadness
Joy
Hope
Worry

LOCATION
Busy
Natural
Lofty
Formal
Isolated
Cosy

PEOPLE
Authority
Rivalry
Play
Threat
Trust
Kindred

The answering player frames a scene to answer the question (location, time, cast, circumstances), assigns characters, and asks a question for the players to answer through the scene.

Scenes end when both questions are answered.

Summarise the scene on an index card. Keep them in chronological order.

When everyone has answered a question, consider where the object goes next.

Repeat (2).
```
<hr>

# Ask & Accommodate
```
1. Frame a scene in which the other players have offered you something enjoyable, but you will need assistance or accommodation to accept.

Examples:
You are invited to dinner, but you need to make sure the meal won't include ingredients you can't eat.
You are asked to join a BBQ party, but you can't afford a safe way to get there.
You've received a helicopter ride voucher as a birthday present, and you need to make sure your physical needs are met.
You're offered a chance to speak at a local event, but you need help with childcare arrangements.

2. Ask the other players to accommodate your needs. Other players must try to accommodate you, and discuss options. Be respectful. Try to understand the need. Work out a solution together. 

3. Move to the next player's turn. Keep your characters' specifics from previous scenes. Just remember which character's needs are in the spotlight of the current scene.

4. Once every player has a short scene, reflect together:
Did you each get what you needed? If not, why not? Did you apologize for anything? Were you defensive? Did you need explanations? How did you feel?

# Neon Nights
```
You are the hard boiled detectives of Mega LA. The world is shit. The Rich and Famous rule the city, law enforcement is all but nonexistent, and all that is left is the private security force, "The Smileys", who are paid to protect the Famous and Rich. Their motto "they'll beat away the poor with a smile on their face!".

As a Hard boiled detective you will be rolling a single six sided die, with 1-3 being your Moxie (you want to roll moxie for trying to talk out a situation or finding clues), and 4-6 being your Grit (you want to roll grit for taking hits and especially for hitting back). If you should roll above or below your intend roll you take a blow. You can take 5 blows before lights out! 

It's up to the GM to decide what the detectives are facing; whether it be a billionaire hunting people for sport and their client is the next hunt, or a POP Diva has gone missing and her Entourage has sent "The Smiles" to burn the slums down until shes found! With the Neon shining it is their job to find the truth!

# Ogre in the Court!
```
You are a fantasy public defender. You represent thieves, cultists, and even intelligent monsters. Today your defendant is THE OGRE!

Ogre has a tendency to rage then attack witnesses, which causes a mistrial.
The Defence doesn't get paid unless the trial completes. 
You MUST keep Ogre calm.

Other players can be the judge, prosecution, witnesses, or Ogre.

There are a minimum 3 witnesses: Eye, Expert, Character.

Roll for crime:
1. Many Manslaughter
2. Grand Theft Mule
3. Uttering Loud and Strangely Detailed Threats
4. Loitering 
5. Assault with a Beehive.
6. Non-Licensed Alchemy.

As witnesses testify, Ogre might overflow with rage over their "baseless" accusations. 

Roll for Witness Mood:
1. Hostile
2. Confident
3. Fearful
4. Friendly

Prosecution and Defence are encouraged to object to each others line of questioning to encourage the Judge to rule in their favour.

The Judge will award a d4, d6, or d8 depending on how the role playing was. Add the number to Ogre's rage pool. If it goes to 12, he will LOSE IT! 

The Defence can call a recess to calm the Ogre down once per trial. Roll a d6 and decrease Ogre's rage by that amount.

ALL RISE FOR THE JUDGE!
```
<hr>

# Stick it to the Man!
```
Requires tokens, paper, 3-5 players.

SETUP

One player is The Man.

- Who are you?
- What do you want?

The others are the Rebels.

- Why do you resist?
- Did you have a chance or choice?
- What will you do?
- What won't you do?

When you hurt The Man, you create Consequence.

Each Rebel has an Approach. Ask The Man:

- The Hurt (3,6,9)
- The Refresh (1,2,3)
- The Consequence (3,6,9)

What is your Goal (recommended 30)

Start with 0 Consequence tokens, and 5 Influence tokens.

PLAY

Ask The Man, "What's going on?"

He'll describe, including:

- Target
- Risk and Reward (Consequence and Influence gain or loss)

The Man bids a hidden Challenge: Target + waged Consequence.

Choose a Rebel to bid Effort: Hurt + waged Influence.

Rebel wins if Effort exceeds the Challenge.

Winner tells result. Losers shut their piehole.

- Add/Subtract Consequence and Influence.
- Add Consequence from Approach.
- Take used Approach to zero.
- Refresh used Approaches, usable again when recharged to Hurt.
- Fix Influence- you can't use or lose it.

ENDGAME

If the Rebels's non-fixed Influence goes below zero, they are crushed. The Man tells what happens.

If their Influence exceeds the Goal and is higher than current Consequence they win and tell how.

# Party People
```
The big event is coming up! It's the most festive time of the year! ...Too bad it's your turn to host the party.

You are a small group of...NOT party people. You have, nonetheless, been tasked with hosting the biggest party of the year. Oh, dear.

To play, you will need plenty of "Confetti" (multiple colors of six-sided dice,) and a large "Confetti Bowl."

For each player: Pick two hinderances. Such as "tin ear," "bland palate," "tacky," "weak stomach," and "bad with budgets." Then pick one skill. Such as "eye for detail," "eclectic taste," and "crafty."

Plan your party. As a group, discuss and decide on food and drink, decor, music, etc. When a decision is made, put a piece of Confetti into the Confetti Bowl for each player. Subtract one piece for each hinderance applicable to the decision, add an extra piece for each skill relevant to the decision.

Roll the Confetti! The total is your group's score. 
```
<hr>

# Revenant
```
You live.

You die.

You come back from the dead only to find out that life goes on without you.



You are the Revenant ("you" and "Revenant" are interchangeable), the other players are Anchors.

The game is divided into 7 phases.

1) Describe who you are: Revenant's name, looks, personality. Ask Anchors to define and describe themselves in relation to you: lover, spouse, child, friend, etc.

2) Each Anchor in turn frames a short slice-of-life scene with you, answering: "What Need of this Anchor does the Revenant satisfy?". Example: sex, love, guidance, support, etc.

3) Describe how you die - literally or symbolically: accident, murder, suicide, life sentence, vanished, etc.

4) Each Anchor in turn frames a scene WITHOUT you, answering: "Who is the Other that satisfies this Anchor's Need while the Revenant is gone?".

# Summer Legends
```
The J. Stanley High School bell rings for the last time of your Sophomore year. You and your friends rush out the front door throwing papers and late assignments to the wind. You, Chip, Jamie, and Slim get on your slick bikes and race down to Graham's Arcade. Your group takes shortcuts, riding in backyards, and through ongoing traffic. As you arrive to the Arcade, you see Mathis with his gang, the Sluggers, messing with kids who want to enter. You and your gang park your bikes behind Mr. Johnson's beige sedan. You find and pick up lucky penny on the ground and gain Charisma. 

A Slugger notices your group and the gang start antagonizing your friends. If you keep on walking, you feel scared and lose Charisma but get to play the latest game. Should you stay and put up with the Sluggers a fight might break out. Chip has her hockey gloves ready in her backpack, Jamie has her soccer ball with marks from the last tussle, Chip with his baseball bat, and you with your tennis racket and some tennis balls. The Sluggers look intimidating but they can't coordinate. How do you decide to start the summer?

# Dear Elizabeth...
```
You are a heroine in a regency or Victorian novel. So is your best friend. Though apart, you write letters to each other. 

You will both need notecards, paper, pens - fountain or quill. Biros will Not Do. Tea & cake optional.

-: Create Your Heroines :-

Describe your personality. Pick a Virtue, a Vice, a Hope. Embrace those 19th century values.
Describe your family. What does Father do? What is Mother like?

How did you meet? Each describe a special moment you share. Why did you part?

-: Setup :- 

On notecards write one each of:
MEETING
GUEST
COURTSHIP
BIRTH
SCANDAL
DEATH
QUARREL
PROPOSAL

Shuffle, deal half to each player.

-: Play :-

Players sit in separate rooms. No interaction between players or their characters except by letter. Maintain the illusion.

An Event happened this Spring. Draw a notecard - interpret imaginatively. 

Use pen & paper to write a letter to your friend. Describe your event. Ask them questions about their life; answer theirs. Develop shared history & supporting characters. Channel your inner Austen, Brontë, Eliot.  

When done, post it under the door. Read the letter posted to you.

Repeat for Summer, Autumn, Winter.

SOLO VARIANT: You write letters, but never receive replies. You wonder why.

# Youre Not A Nice Person Will You Die That Way
```
With a group, create a nonlinear story of doomed criminals given an ultimatum and sent on a suicide mission. You will need 3x5 cards, d6s, and players.

-Collaboratively decide your final goal/genre: assassination, stealing documents, sabotage a doomsday weapon in WWII, high fantasy, ancient China, etc.
-Players secretly write one "unbeatable" obstacle of the mission on a card. Shuffle the cards.
-Players write the name of their criminal on a card. DON'T discuss other character details.

On each player's turn, narrate a scene addressing either:

-Life (criminal, familial) prior to capture
-Pre-mission training with the group
-The mission itself

Have this scene reveal character and context. Can they be redeemed? Should they?

After a scene, roll dice equal to 1 + (# of character deaths). On any 6, a DEATH SCENE triggers. Otherwise, pass to the next scene.

On a DEATH SCENE, shuffle name cards. Draw one with an obstacle card. That player narrates the group's success over the obstacle and the death of their character. Players with dead characters still get turns.

Play until two characters remain. Those players each roll a die. On a 6, their character survives. Combine the final two obstacles and narrate the finale.

Heart: Bond: Place two cards next to each other. Write the nature of the bond. 

Spade: Catastrophe: Draw another card. A character matching its suit dies. 

Diamond: Doubt. Draw another card. A matching character becomes disillusioned and leaves. 

Club: Toll: Draw another card. A matching character is transformed. Write a new adjective.
