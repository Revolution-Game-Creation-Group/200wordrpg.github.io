# Sidewalkia!
```
One player stands in a square of sidewalk with clearly defined boundaries and shouts: 

"I CLAIM THIS LAND IN THE NAME OF SIDEWALKIA."

This player is now the Prime Minister.

Other players join by declaring their loyalty to SIDEWALKIA. The PM declares each new player a role in the government. 

Each player describes an aspect of SIDEWALKIA's landscape, using real-world landmarks nearby as inspiration. 

Each player describes an unusual, outlandish historical moment of SIDEWALKIA.

Each player declares something that SIDEWALKIA needs to succeed/grow/prevail.

Without leaving the boundaries, look for these things in the world around you. 

To get these things, convince others to join SIDEWALKIA. Chant catchy slogans or sing songs to make passersby smile and join. If your total numbers reach more than 4, expand to another square and redistribute your population how you see fit. CELEBRATE RAUCOUSLY when new citizens join you.

If someone walks through your square, SIDEWALKIA suffers a natural disaster. Describe it, mourn, and rebuild.

If someone pauses, they vacationed in SIDEWALKIA. Describe their vacation experience for them, congratulate yourselves on being a destination.

The game ends if your population reaches 15 or you have expanded to three or more squares of concrete.

# PaperBits Showdown
```
Players get one index card, and they have 5 minutes to draw their character on the card. The player is then given 5d10 to assign to features of their character with a maximum of 1d10. The player rolls each d10, assigning the result as HP to that feature. 
Before combat, the DM has 30 seconds per player to draw out as many enemies as they can on post it notes, assigning 1d10 to each of the enemies they manage to create. Enemies must have at least 4 limbs, and one head.  
Combat is simple - the player targets an enemy / post-it with one of the features on their index card. The player then rolls their d10 for that feature against the enemy d10. If the player has the higher number, they destroy the post it. If the enemy wins, they do damage equal to their roll to that features HP. Features that drop to zero HP are erased. The player is considered "dead" if all their limbs assigned dice are all erased. Players may choose to heal by affixing the enemy limbs to their index card if they roll a 10 during combat.

A game about fighting the clock and reaching objectives.

Go to your local.
Get the first round, steal the comfy seats.
GM is designated driver. Buy them soft drinks.
Remember to have a laugh.

Talk setting, characters, silly voices, the mcguffin, why you want to steal it, where it is.

Panic! when
Bored
Plot too simple
Awful joke
etc.

# Sensitive Emotional Breakthrough
```
Each player is a disembodied emotion in search of validation. Fill a whimsically-decorated serving dish with macaroons. Each player gets a box of tissue.

Take turns talking about which emotion you are. If someone cries, they get to take another turn. Everyone else eats a macaroon.

When you're all done talking about your emotions, look out the window. If it's still daytime, the person who cried the most gets another turn. If it's nighttime, the tallest player gets to sing a song and everyone else eats a macaroon.

The game ends when there are no more macaroons. Group hug; you're all winners.

Fin.

# Tower of death
```
Requirements: 
1+ player(s) 
1 gamemaster 
6-sided dice
Jenga tower 
Timer

What's going on? Where the hell are you? 
You find yourself on the top floor of Tiny Tower, which ironically has 34 floors. 

You hear screams and suddenly your phone is being blown up by alerts: people are going insane on the streets, killing and eating each other!
You've got to get to a safe haven and find your family... or maybe just get some fresh air and have a smoke. 

The players form an alliance to get out of the tower of death, while the gamemaster provides creative ways of scaring the players, creating intense situations for players to handle and calling for d6 rolls to find useful items.

In intense situations, the players describe their action and have to stack the Jenga tower while under a time limit. Depending on the difficulty and how they handle the situation, they may have less time to do so.
If the tower falls, then death awaits. If the timer reaches zero? Pain. 
When bitten, you must roll a d6 every time someone stacks the tower. 3 or higher turns you into one of them.

Good luck getting out alive!

# Don't Tust HUMAN
```
You are ALIEN. Find another who is HUMAN. Bring a writing surface and implement, deck of cards, and 7 trinkets each.

Shuffle the deck. HUMAN draws a card and hides it. Do not trust them! They are duplicitous. If their card is a face card they desire WAR! Otherwise they desire PEACE! You win if you achieve PEACE! HUMAN wins if it achieves its desire.

Do not speak to HUMAN. They cannot speak back. HUMAN's mouth parts are too different. Its noises are strange. Arrange your trinkets in front of you. HUMAN does the same. Record a TRADE, trinket for trinket. Do not let HUMAN see. Play in rounds.

Each Round

1) Is HUMAN a filthy sneak? You may take your trinkets and leave. No one wins.

2) Through gestures, explain to HUMAN your TRADE. No pointing! No spelling! No numbers! You are noble. You will not cheat.

3) HUMAN presents a trinket and points at one of yours. Is this your TRADE?

Yes? TRADE is successful. You have achieved PEACE!

No? Flip a card off the top of the deck. If revealed cards would bust in Blackjack HUMAN has tricked you! They take all your trinkets. This means WAR!

# Haiku Rebels Society
```
Japan, 1633. The HRS uses poetry to stir and organize an uprising against the isolationist Shogun. Rebels' punishment is death.

3-6 players create a rebel each with one verse. Verses must be 3 to 5 words long. One player is the Shogun (first verse "Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu").

REBELS.
Talk in first person. Describe quotidianity, people's problems, meetings.

When you find fuel for the uprising, write a verse about it. 

SHOGUN.
Listen. Show isolationism; tease rebels.

When a rebel:
- talks about uprisings;
  or 
- pronounces forbidden words,
write a verse about it.

PLAYERS.
Recite a finished haiku (3 consecutive verses).

If it has a Kigo (seasonal reference) or kireji (oxymoron or caesura), you explain:
- the uprising advancement [delete one of the Shogun's verses]; 
  or 
- isolation laws' enactment [forbid a 4+ letters word; delete it from rebels' verses];

Otherwise, you describe:
- the uprising advancement with casualties or problems [rewrite one of the Shogun's verses].
  or 
- new tax's imposition [rebels delete a word per tax from haikus they recite].

UPRISING.
When Shogun's haikus reach 200+ undeleted words, rebels write two haiku each, describing:
- their arrest;
  and
- if their haikus reached 200+ undeleted words, part of a successful uprising.
Then rebels suffer death sentence.

# Goo-goo Ga-ga
```
Silence.

Warmth.

You are content.

Suddenly, bright lights! Loud noises! Rapid motion!

It's cold here! Where are you? What's going on?!?

Ugh, another loud noise!

Wait. It's coming from your own mouth. You're screaming.

It's too much. You don't like it here.

Huge, steady hands grasp your body. This new room is strange, white, but more temperate. 

Gentle hands hug you to their warm body. Tasty liquid enters your mouth. You swallow.

For a moment, you feel content. You like this person. They make you feel safe.

The other set of hands is back. They take you to a different room. Now you are in a box with clear sides. You have your own blanket, but feel very lonely. Where is the friendly person with milk? 

Through the clear walls, you see others your size. Maybe they can tell you where you are, or why big people here keep little people in boxes.


You need a 4 to successfully take action.

Roll 1d4 (+1 if no nurse nearby) to move.

1d6 to read another baby's thoughts.

1d8 to cry. Maybe you can summon someone.

Sleeping requires no roll.

+1 bonus to one action after feeding / sleeping.

# RED TREACHERY
```
The Red Lady calls from inside the mountain. You and your friends hear her screams during the night. The other children don't. Together, find answers at the mountainside.

Describe why you choose to investigate.
In secret, choose a friend you want to PROTECT.

You find an opening. As you descend, it collapses behind you. FIND AN EXIT. The Red Lady watches from the dark, singing temptations through her unhinged jaw.

Sentient traps, gruesome puzzles, and unfathomable magics scar the underground city.

You start with 2 Fear.

When doing something difficult, roll d6 equal to your Fear. If throwing someone, roll d10's instead.

If you roll any 1's, everything worsens; you gain one Fear. Otherwise, you succeed.

If you roll two or more 1's, the Red Lady crawls from beyond, her jaw twitching sporadically.
Either
You are TAKEN by her.
Or
If a friend succeeds on a roll to throw another friend towards her, they are TAKEN in your place.

Those TAKEN become the Red Lady and may speak through her in temptations, trying to make players betray each other.

If two remain, and one PROTECTs the other, they escape the cavern together.
Else, only one can escape alive.

# A Tiny Person
```
A tiny person is hiding under a paper cup. This cup is mixed in among many other paper cups, all upside down. This person is purely imaginary, a conceit of the game-they are not real and are not represented by a player. The players want to find the tiny person, for whatever reason. 

As the players play, they will talk to each other and to the little hiding person, discovering the setting and who they are as they play.

The players will begin by trying to entice the tiny person out with words, then gently lifting the cups one at a time. The players will become angrier as each cup is revealed to be empty. Eventually they will start swatting cups off the table, then smashing them.  All of these will prove to be empty too. 

Eventually one cup will be left. The players know that this cup conceals the tiny person-it is a certainy. Pause a moment, let anyone speak who wants to speak, but someone must smash the cup.
 
Clean up the play area, but leave that last smashed cup untouched. Do not look underneath.  The game is over.

# Two People F*** in a Spaceport
```
A two player game where two people meet at a spaceport to fuck. Who they are, what they are and why they're going to fuck is up to you. Why in space? Why not???

A timer
A random number generator

DESCRIBE to each other:

The surroundings of your meeting

How you present yourself differently to meet them

Where you last met and how long ago

How you leave to go to the hotel

When the hour is up, take a break! Discuss together what you hope will happen next. Plan it! Your characters certainly have been...

Next, randomly generate a number of minutes between 10 and 60 and set the timer. This is your time alone together. You may wish for more! You may find yourselves with too much.

Play until your timer rings, then you may have an additional sentence each.

AFTER, describe one thing you left behind: physical or not, intentionally or not.

(Want 3+ players? +50% to each time base per person!)

# The Revolution Will Take Us All
```
The Revolution is coming. Fearful streets whisper: this rotting order will finally topple.

Choose from these characters:
* loyal soldier
* bitter lord
* anxious lover
* clever merchant
* naive rebel
* compassionate thief

Tell us their name, their wishful dream, their looming fear.

From a poker deck without face cards, lay 3 scene cards face-down for each player. Draw hands of 4 outcome cards. Never discuss them. 

Take turns. Reveal your next face-down scene. Roleplay your character. Describe surviving the turmoil. Imply their fragile world.

Themes:
* Clubs - Power
* Diamonds - Money
* Hearts - Companionship
* Spades - Hope

We join the roleplaying as troublesome things: endangered friends, spreading chaos, violent strangers. We bedevil you. When you can't bear more, place an outcome card across the scene to resolve it.

* Outcome > Scene: place face-up. Tell how your sacrifices make things better. 
* Outcome <= Scene: place face-down. Tell what you salvage for yourself, and the price paid by others.

When the last scene resolves, the Revolution comes. Sum outcome cards (revealing face-downs), then sum scene cards. Subtract the lower sum from the higher. If your remaining hand card is greater than the difference, you survive. From highest hand to lowest, narrate our epilogue: the fate of society and those who mattered.

# Crystalium
```
In a world ruled by sorcerers, you have decided to challenge your lack of magic through gem alchemy.

To create an alchemist, chose two colors for your major color group and give yourself five gems of that color. Do the same for the two minor color group and give yourself three gems. The remaining colors are opposed, and you get only one gem.

You resolve actions by using gems of the color you want which changes the way you approach actions. Gems give you supernatural abilities, but also change your personality while you are attuned to theirs colors. More gems mean more power.

Red gems make you aggressively and with a sense of urgency. They increase strength and awareness.

Blue gems make you act professionally and calmly. They increase oratory and cognitive abilities.

Green gems make you act peacefully and in balance of your emotions. They increase endurance and health.

Yellow gems make you act cheerfully and optimistically. They increase speed and reflexes.

Purple gems make you act with sensitivity and love for other. They increase natural charm and empathy.

White gems make you act with balance and purpose. They cancel the magic of other gems.
```
<hr>

# Pay it Forward
```
A coin and two or more players.

"Kindness goes a long way" they said. They also said that it was better to give than to receive. But what if you could do both?

The person with the shortest pinky starts the game by describing a fictional random act of kindness bestowed upon them. The person to their immediate right gives a glimpse to their characters own needs. The first player bestows a kindness* upon them, with detail. Flip the coin to see if the receiver pays it forward (heads) or halts the kindness (tails) with themselves.  

Halting the kindness removes the player from the game.  Pass the coin to the next person on the right. They start describing their character, with the person on the left describing the kindness their character will bestow. Play continues counter-clockwise until only one player remains.

In the end? Everyone wins. 

Pay it forward.

*Acts of kindness should be realistic. No grand gestures of throwing money at the problem.

# Charlie, the Devil and Me
```
Write these names on three different index cards.

Charlie.
The Devil
Me

Charlie is the only AM radio newsreader we receive out here.
The Devil won't get off my shoulder. 
And here's Me, stuck between them and the backroads.

Charlie sets a scene; reading off the weather, the date and what local event is happening right now. 
The Devil states our most desperate Need.
Ask Me... we'll say how we try to get it.
The Devil says what tries to stop Me, and we get to respond.
Charlie decides who wins out, and closes off with a news report of "the incident".

Possible Needs: Food. Water. Care. An Audience. Help. Fuel. Closure. Answers.

As the scene ends, each pass your card to the player on your left, and the new Charlie kicks us off. Repeat until 9 scenes have played. 

Come the end, The Devil will say what we lost, and ask Me... you'll hear what we found. Charlie, as always, will tell us what the News had to say about it.

# Confabulation
```
Five players portray Witnesses of a crime and Detectives looking for answers. Need: pencils, 20 notecards.

-Setup-
Write Detective attributes on separate notecards:
- Personality: Arrogant, Intelligent, Cautious, Rookie, Observant
- Approach: Demand, Intimidate, Empathize, Bargain, Convince
- Flaw: Temper, Nerves, Overwhelmed, Distrustful, Lazy

Randomly take one from each category.

Write questions on separate notecards:
- What crime was committed?
- Who did it?
- Where did they go?
- When did it occur?
- Why did they do it?

Randomly take one. Write five answers on the back. Keep them secret.

-Witness-
Pass answers left. Cross off one answer. Repeat until only one answer remains on each. These are the answers. Hide them. Remember what you can. Memory is subjective.

-Investigate-
Take turns being a Witness. Detectives to your left and right question you. Set a timer for 3 minutes. Detectives act their attributes, attempt to learn answers. Witness reacts to Detectives, attempts to recall answers. Stop when the timer ends. Repeat for each player. Perception becomes truth.

-Deduce-
Detectives piece together answers to solve the crime. Do you know enough to confidently close the case or is it left unsolved?

If you close the case, check answers. Were you wrong?

How do you succeed or fail?
```
<hr>

# Trench
```
You are a group of soldiers, huddled in a trench trying to make peace with your final moments. 

Players: 5 Soldiers with a Director

Before play, write a secret, a regret, and a hope for your Soldier.

The Director times Rounds, deals cards, and announces the high card at the end of each Round.

Soldiers sit on the floor between two lines of chairs that represent the sides of the trench. Rounds last 15 minutes. At the beginning of each Round, the Soldiers are each dealt a card from a standard deck. At the end of each round the Player with the highest card dies. Players may not show their cards to each other. Shuffle and redeal each round.

During rounds, each Soldier should try to make peace with their almost certain death. They should unburden themselves. They should talk about why they are here and why they fight.
When a Soldier dies, they take a seat and silently face the remaining Soldiers. A Soldier may choose to sacrifice themselves to save another. 

Play ends when all but one Soldier is dead. The dead now portray their families and the Survivor tells them the story of their lost love one.

# City of Souls
```

You're a soul fragment of The City, incarnate as a human to rise against the rot that gnaws your mother.
Corruption, criminality, pollution.

One of your brothers has failed The City.
He's The Lost Soul.
He's your enemy.
And he's one of the players.


- Roll secretly 2d6 with the referee. The lowest roll designates the Lost Soul.
- Choose four Aspects: a name, and three other broad traits that may apply to both a human and a city's neighborhood.
- One has to be a serious flaw!
Ex: John, artistic, full of life, insane
- Each is valued 6.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To perform a difficult action:
 - Choose an appropriate Aspect (including Name)
 - Roll 1d6 and minus Aspect by one
 - Roll <= Aspect: success, otherwise: failure
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except Name, all Aspects can generate « low magic » (use your imagination).
A serious wound reduces Name by 1.
Reaching 0 on an Aspect means Soul's vanishing.


Play a short adventure in which characters fight corruption/criminality/pollution in a big city (think about "street-level characters" in comic books).
If at the end the flaw of the Lost Soul is above 0 and lower than any "positive Aspects" of the other players, Mother City dies, and The Enemy reveals himself.

# Home Church
```
1-2 players. Requires the game Guess Who and a 10-sided die.

You were ten before you noticed all your parents' friends were church friends. There was no time for anyone else, and these friends babysat you, attended your birthday parties, carried furniture when your house flooded. Their kids were your friends, though you don't talk to them anymore. You will see many of them and their parents today, the day of your final visit to your home church. Time and distance will never let you return.

Start with all Guess Who cards face-up. On each round, roll a d10. Choose that number of faces to lower, and tell how they fit into the story of that round.

Round 1- They attended your graduation and bought you a gift
2- They made it clear they disapprove of your partner
3- They distanced themselves after the divorce
4- They still send you holiday cards
5- Political rants on Facebook
6- They live in your city and never call
7- The kindest person(s) you ever met
8- The cruelest person(s) you ever met

Choose one person. They talk to you before you leave the sanctuary. What do they say?

# Day at the Planet
```
A 1v1 game about surviving the terrestrial.

Roles: 
The Alien; a physically all-powerful being limited only by necessary secrecy. Their goal is to go unnoticed. 
The Planet; The Alien's normal human workplace and the colleagues/superiors therein that must be placated and kept oblivious. They present The Alien with tasks. 

When The Planet presents a task (eg. drink coffee, type a report) they give a target number: 
     7 (minimal effort for humans) 
     10 (average) 
     14 (unreasonable) 
     17 (beyond human limitations) 
The Alien then rolls any number of d6 they choose. 

If the result is up to two above or below the target number, they succeed and narrate their actions accordingly. 

If they are 3 or more below the target number, they narrate their failure from insufficient effort (they fumble/drop the mug, the report is late). 

If they are 3 or more above the target number, they narrate how their over-achievement arouses suspicion (they crush the mug in their grip, the report is impossibly detailed). 

The game ends when: 
     The Alien fails 3 tasks and is fired for incompetence 
     The Alien over-achieves 3 tasks, is exposed as an alien, and shunned 
     The Alien gets through the day

IMPRINT, roll HELD dice. Take narrative control by PLAYING dice to meet RAZOR's totaled PLAYED. If you cannot, play none, only respond.

Reaction time is a factor.

Player with higher PLAYED total determines PROBLEM ending; keep scenes brief. Players pass PLAYED dice, HOLD passed with non-played dice for next PROBLEM.

RAZOR, quote EDGE during PROBLEM, include IMPRINT's action, instead ask "Why are you doing this?" Roll EDGE, PLAY with others. Discard afterward.

IMPRINT, reference ECHO before PLAYING rolled dice, roll ECHO, PLAY with others. Discard afterward.

Testing ends after one player uses all EDGES / ECHOES.


Decommissioning:
Players roll HELD and unused EDGES / ECHOES. Player with more dice begins physical scene, PLAYING any amount. Match PLAYED total to take narrative control. Discard dice once PLAYED. Once unmet, narrate conclusion including / avoiding decommission.

# Life Behind Screens
```
Everyone plays a courtier with four stats:

Eligibility
Wit
Bitterness
Rank

Draw a card for each.

Name your character.

The goal is to gain and keep rank.

Every few years, a young noble debuts at court. One player draws a card (this is the noble's rank), and describes their name and achievements, and this year's festive contest (e.g. archery, poetry, feasting).

Successfully courting a noble gives a character +1 rank. Marrying them gives a player character their exact rank.

When the outcome of a character's action is disputed, or they are trying to court someone, their player draws a card. A result less than the appropriate attribute is a success. Rank decides ties.

Each character who wins/loses a contest gains/loses one point of the appropriate attribute.

At the end of each debut, all player player characters increase their Bitterness by 1 and decrease their Eligibility by 1. The declaration of the next debutante is done by the player on their left.

# Filling the Void
```
A game about the space between story and self.

2+ players
 
Things
A large flat playing surface
Enough paper to cover it
Many small objects of various sizes and colours
Marking devices

Finding the Tone
To begin, read a mythological tale aloud.
 
Casting the Night Sky
Gather up the small objects in your hands, as many as you can hold. These are your stars.
In a single motion, throw the stars down onto the playing surface. We all do this at once.
 
Naming the Constellations
Take turns.
On your turn, find a group of stars of any number that look like a constellation. Draw the lines connecting the constellation. Name it out loud.
The next player tells a story about the constellation, a myth about its origin or meaning.
The last player relates the myth or constellation to the lives of everyday people. They tell a personal story about someone living under our sky, from the perspective of the inhabitant.

Welcoming the Dawn
Continue playing for any length of time, over any number of days, until the night sky is filled with your stories.
