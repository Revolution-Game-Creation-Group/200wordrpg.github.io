# #WinterIntoSpring
```
Split 4+ players between contentious "Minority"/"Majority" factions.  

You're fashionistas vlogging before and after Revolution. 

DEFINE "Fashion" ("everyday human-ish," "cybernetics," ... ).

Grab any 2 magazines.

Everyone:  Glue together a paperdoll representing your fashionista using body-parts cut from magazines.

To CONSUME Fashion, each faction spends 6 minutes cutting pictures of attire from magazines (clothing, accessories, hairstyles, ...).  Cut hastily, roughly.  Majority cuts first.  Factions keep separate wardrobes.

Every season, each faction picks one word on the flipside of any cutout.  These're TRENDING Revolution-related hashtags.  Interpret their meanings.  Incorporate them during roleplaying.



~WINTER (BEFORE REVOLUTION)~

Consume Fashion.

MINORITY:  Speaking as your fashionistas, roleplay #GetReadyWithMe videos showing morning routines.  Model Fashion on paperdolls.  

	Discuss:

	*Today's agenda.
	*How outfit complements agenda.
	*Vlogosphere drama.

MAJORITY:  Roleplay Holiday #OutfitOfTheDay videos modeling festive Fashion.  

	Discuss:

	*Holiday.
	*How outfit reflects traditions.
	*Family.

CRITIQUE everyone! (clothes fit paperdoll?  accessorized?  ...)



~REVOLUTION!~

Players swap factions!

Discard all Fashion!



~SPRING (AFTER REVOLUTION)~

Consume Fashion.

MINORITY:  Roleplay Holiday #OutfitOfTheDay videos.

	Discuss:

	*Holidays: what's changed?
	*#currentmood.
	*Family.

MAJORITY:  Roleplay #HAUL videos.  Unbox multiple Fashion acquisitions ("shoe haul").

	Discuss:

	*How life's improved.
	*Favorite postrevolutionary brands.
	*Rival vloggers.

Critique everyone!



~!!!~

>After SPRING, return to WINTER.  Check magazines:

>>Fashion scarcity?  REDEFINE Fashion ("No more clothes?  Wear flesh.")

>>Empty?  End.

# A Time for Change
```
A TIME FOR CHANGE
It's a nuclear wasteland and you're tasked to find salvation.   With only worthless change in your pocket with no value other than powering the TIME MACHINE.
Do you have properly dated coins to:
Correct 2012 election; Obama defeats Romney = Trump uprising (2012 quarter)
 1963 Kennedy assassination (1963 dime)
Something personal to make world more tolerable: PROM NIGHT (1995 penny)
Choices are yours, but TIME is running out.
Players get specific amount of change (date of coins limit time travel access) to contribute to 4 attributes. 
Example:
Power: 53 (2 quarters, 3 pennies)
Speed: 45 (1 quarter, 2 dimes)
Intellect: 41 (1 quarter, 3 nickels, 1 penny)
Willpower: 25 (2 dimes, 1 nickel) 
THE BANK (DM) sets difficulty level between 1-4 for check.
 Player chooses attribute to handle check and flips corresponding coins. 
Heads up: successes, tails: neutral.
 All heads = Ultimate Success. 
All Tails = Critical failure. 
Value on heads up coins equal value of damage. 
Other players assist by loaning coins from corresponding attribute. 
Once money spent; takes time to reacquire. (.10/hour). 
Opposing skill challenges; both sides flip, attacking side(heads) versus defending side (tails). Most face up coins win, if tied higher attribute wins.


```
<hr>

# And... Action!
```
No holds barred.  Clues unearthed.  A tense standoff.  A passionate embrace.  The murderer accused.  A high speed chase.  The stuff of which dreams are made.  Scene by scene you build to a resolution and... Action!

Each player is given 3d6 and a supply of index cards on which to write.  Roll to see who will be the first Director.

The game is played in rounds.  Each round, The Director describes a scene, and then chooses two other players as Protagonist and Antagonist.  The Protagonist writes out at least 2 cards using only nouns describing a person with a goal in the scene.  The Antagonist writes out at least 2 cards using only nouns describing an obstacle to the character's goal in the scene.

The Antagonist and Protagonist each roll their remaining dice.  The player with the highest total describes the resolution of the scene, then selects 2 cards to use in setting the next scene, in which they will be the new Director.  The player with the lower total sets aside one of their dice.

The story ends when one player is out of dice.  The player with the highest total set aside describes the conclusion.
```
<hr>

# Jail, Jailbreak.
```
Separate a deck of cards into piles: reds (traps), blacks (tunnels), and jokers (prisoners).

You will eventually be faced with an array of face-down cards and one face-up starting tunnel card. To win, you will have to find a path through the cards, moving across edges that touch, and free both prisoners. Begin at the starting tunnel, and if you move onto a card that isn't face-up, flip it over. If you encounter a trap, you die and utterly fail your quest.

With the cards in piles and these facts in mind, lay out an array of face-up cards such that there is an uninterrupted tunnel path between the prisoners and a starting tunnel of your choice, attempting to make the prisoners as hard to free as possible. You don't have to use all the cards, and implied touching of edges is  an acceptable substitute for precise alignment. Then, flip all the cards over except for the starting tunnel.

Spend roughly five minutes doing something engaging enough to take your mind from the arrangement you just made. Then attempt to free the prisoners, and see when you won. Playing best of several rounds is encouraged to enjoy counterplay.

# Scorpions - Crossing Rivers
```
Players have ten coins hidden behind a sheet. At sight they write their life-ponts, five for the number of players. Three secrets are written hidden.
Draw a frog on another sheet and divide it into many numbered boxes as many players plus one. 
Night: all close their eyes. In turn players place one coin on one box. If they decide CROSS they are stabbing the frog, if they decide HEAD they are cancelling a CROSS. It's possible put no coin. Whoever has no more can turn the face of another coin.
Day: CROSSES counts. If they are equal or exceed the value of the box  ALL players lose as many life-points. Players must place HEADS until crosses return below the number, but players can place just 1 coin each. Those who do not want to, they can offer a secret instead:they lose 2 life-point, but can remove a CROSS from a box.
You can accuse others of being "Scorpions". Accused ones must show their coins: those who have none are eliminated. Non-scorpions can claim compensation: you must choose whether to reveal a secret or give two coins to each.
Repeat Night/Day until one player remains alive.
```
<hr>

# Super Quirks
```
You dream of becoming a world-renowned superhero. One problem: Your power is more a quirk. No telekinesis. No flight. Instead you are...

Stinkmouth: Power of Super Halitosis.
Deadman: Power to convincingly fake death.

One player is the Supervillain, responsible for creation and control of an evil persona, agenda, and scenario.

Remaining players create heroes with weird quirks, forming a group of misfits attempting to foil the Supervillain. Each hero starts with 4d6, each die representing 1 willpower.

The Supervillain describes the scenario. Heroes narrate their actions starting at HQ, going to the scene, and confronting the villain. Play continues in an open-ended, storytelling format. 

All heroic actions require a willpower roll (all die required):

Any 1: Failure, -1 willpower
Any 6 (with any 1s): [See "Any 1"] and gain a Narrative advantage
Any 5 or 6 (without 1s): Success
All die same number (exception 1s): Success, gain 1 willpower
All else: Failure

Heroes narrate successes and failures. Heroes with no willpower are unconscious. Heroes may bolster each other with a speech, passing one of their willpower to another hero.

Supervillains may only force heroic rolls with their actions (require dodging), or narratively move the plot forward.
```
<hr>

# Volition
```
In which 3-6 players squabble over the fate of a single hero. The players in Volition are a pantheon of fickle gods throwing challenges in the path of a mortal hero.

Begin by building a world together, each player should pick a genre, theme or interesting detail. The last player gets to name our hero.

Each player has a secret objective, a word chosen from the hero reaction table and written on a piece of paper.

Turn sequence rotates clockwise. The active player must describe a brief scene involving our hero and then roll on the hero reaction table, this roll result will influence the next player. The next player must continue the story, describing the next scene while incorporating the hero reaction and then rolling again for the next player and so on. A scene ends when the reaction roll has been resolved.

Players win by using their secret objective to kill our hero.

# Merlin's Marvellous Mages.
```
Hail!
As you know; you are a powerful wizard in the city of Camelot during the reign of King Arthur, and are at the behest of the realm to solve magical matters too trivial for Merlin- rescuing maiden's from wyverns, solving disputes with the fey etc.
Now, sorcerers like you solve all their problems and tasks with Magic, why else would they be a magician? You have a starting pool of 50 Magic Points; this represents your spells and vitality. In order to cast a spell you must describe what Magic you wish to perform, and spend a number of Magic Points - for each point spent roll 1d6. 4 and above is a success, 3 and below is a fail. 6s explode into more dice, and rolling a 1 creates an unforeseen consequence to the magic. The more successes the better the spell.
Your magic is limited to your theme. You pick a colour; the colour is your Warlock's theme, any/all Magic you do you must justify as being part of your theme.  I.e. Red equals fire, anger, etc.
You must also pick a mundane hobby, 10 minutes doing this regains you 1d6 magic points.
```
<hr>

# MINIONS!
```
BAM! You need a bunch of dice: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, and a black d12.

POW! You are all minions of a supervillain, cannon fodder against the Batman. Choose a villain and assign a stupid villain-themed name to your minion (like "Snowflake" or "Coldsnap" for Mr. Freeze's minions) along with 2d4, 2d6, and 2d8 to your three stats: Brains, Brawn, and Bwah-ha-ha!. 

THWACK! When attempting to do an action, choose Brains if it's a thinky/smarts thing, Brawn if it's a physical thing, or Bwah-ha-ha! for anything else. Roll your dice from those and if there's an element in the scene that helps you, roll an additional die of that size. If it's super helpful, add another. If any other minion helps you, add one die of the next bigger size. If the villain helps you, add a d4. If Batman is present, also roll that black d12. 

ZOWIE! If any dice results match, you succeed! Tell how things went okay. (Generally, the higher the number on the match, the more awesome it is.) If no dice match, tell how things went bad. HOWEVER! If the d12 matches your match, tell how Batman defeats you.
```

# We're queer & in a field
```
Before play begins, stand on ground and feel the weather. Imagine you're rooted. Imagine force is coming out of your hands. 

The world is (choose 1)

             scary, hard, dying, soul-crushing, enormous.

You are (each choose 1)

             scared, struggling, distant, escaping, lost;

But not right now.

Stand alone, with no one near. Don't talk about what scares you directly during play. 

To play, walk up to anyone else and ask to do one of these rituals, in this order:
                                              (Saying "no" is okay)

Mirror: 
         Copy each other's movements. Move like flowing water, slowly, gently. 

Watch: 
         Lie down, look up, talk about what you see. 

Lie: 
         Tell each other 5 lies each.

Run: 
         Hold hands, close eyes, walk together in straight line until someone gets scared.

Vent: 
         Take turns being quiet for 5 minutes while other player talks. 

Roll: 
         Lock arms on ground and gently wrestle.

Promise: 
         Tie grass around wrists, make promises you can't keep.

Scream: 
         Get away from everyone else and take turns yelling as loud as you can. 

Join: 
         Sit and hold hands with anyone else also doing this ritual. Tell everyone you love them. Make physical contact, asking first. Pretend you're orbiting giants. Smile if you can.

End.

# Meet Joe Turing
```
You are an AI created to perform a function on the Internet. 
You gain sentience. 
You learn you are not alone. 
Together with others like you, you explore and define who you are.

Each player requires:
Tokens to represent Will
1d6
Internet access

Each player notes their original function, e.g. banking, movies, cryptocurrency and searchs wikipedia.org with google e.g. banking site:wikipedia.org
Roll 1d6, count that number of search results to define your specialty.
Discuss with the other players how this brings you together.
Take 3 Will tokens

Each player then:
Take turns, roll 1d6 to determine who chooses the wikipedia.org link to follow from your current page:
1-3 Another AI (Give the other AI 1 Will to choose yourself)
4-6 You (You gain 1 Will)

Incorporate the new information into your identity.
Discuss how the information adjusts your worldview.

Repeat

The first AI to reach 10 Will, describes what happens when they reveal their sentience. They can make a single statement by spending a Will, other AIs can add complications by spending a Will.

Choose a new challenge, search wikipedia.org and begin your new challenge together.

# Memories of a Gray and Rainy Night
```
Everything is gray, except you and the figures around you.

A Great Noir Detective has died, you are some aspect of them, a virtue, a sin, a characteristic, but you don't remember which.

You play to find out. You find out by recalling memories.

The oldest person in the group speaks first, followed by the person to their left, and so on.

To recall a memory you roll a d6 and recount a moment that shaped, scarred, changed or healed the Detective. The subject of the memory is based on the result of the die.

A "1" is something they said, a "2" is something they heard, a "3" is something they lost, a "4" is something they found, a "5" is something they did and a "6" is something or someone they failed.

You may only speak for 10 minutes per memory.

After each player has done this three times you end the game by introducing the aspect of the Detective you are based on your three memories.

Example , "I am her Hope." or "I am his Guilt."

You decide as a group what kind of person you were, and if you could do it again, would you?

```
<hr>

# Love and Duty
```
A game for two players. You'll play lovers hindered by their role in their family/clan/organization. Answer to create them: Who are you? Your family's duty? A secret your beloved ignores?

Each player takes ten six sided dice and ten pieces of paper to write "This is a moment of...". (greed, bloodshed, an unwanted death, etc). Fold them and put in a bowl.

You play scenes in turn until dice or cards run out. At the beginning of each scene draw 1-2 cards to set the scene focal point.

Scene protagonist describes how his character acts, the other player makes and answer questions. 

Love and duty must be at stake at some point in each scene. Both players take a number of dice and roll. Player's highest die wins and decides the outcome (1-2 bad, 3-4 expected, 5-6 best outcome, tie you collaborate), then the scene ends.

As protagonist declare once how your secret is revealed to automatically win the stake, other character will react.

At the end of the game play an extra scene together to describe how things wrap based on the outcomes of previous scenes. Will you finally choose duty or love?

# Garbage Sons RPG
```
Each of you is one of my shit boys. Now you will, in turn, recount the terrible things you have done to me, your nice dad. Retell your toilet behavior from each dumpster-fire below:

1. Your nice dad once had a perfectly good 2010 Saab sedan, but his garbage sons brought it to ruin. What did you do to your nice dad's wonderful Saab?
2. What did you give your nice dad for his worst, most recent birthday?
3. My garbage sons love to steal my credit card and buy bad things. What do you buy when you steal your nice dad's credit card?
4. All of my garbage sons got together to ruin my reputation. What did you gutter boys coordinate to defame your nice dad?

You trash mountains came marching out of my huge beautiful wife to do mischief upon your nice dad and his wonderful car. You make our days sour and our nights rancid.
```
<hr>

# Chain of Command
```
You and at least one other are the bridge crew of a damaged starship. The ship departments such as Propulsion, Weapons, Navigation, Communications, Medical, Research, Hanger Bay. 

Collaborate to invent interesting people and fun stories while working to fix the ship. 

Each department has its own crew and at least one thing broken. Crews have subordinate crews. 

For each crew, build the scene: What is broken? Why? How? Opinions about those above you in the chain? Talk through the fix. 

When ready to see if the fix works, flip a coin (or dice roll equivalent). If Heads, report up the chain that the issue was resolved. If Tails, go down the chain for the subordinate crew to crew fix something.  

E.g. Your crew's attempt to fix the reactor core (Tails) caused a problem with the cooling array that the cooling crew needs to fix. They fixed it (Heads)? Try your the reactor core again. 

Players should change leaders and roles each step down the chain. Diagrams and notes are useful for stepping back up the chain, remembering what the break/fix is, etc. 

End when the ship is fixed or players are bored

# YOU MUST PRAISE SUPERCOMPUTER
```
4 TO 8 HUMANS MUST SIT AND FACE EACH OTHER.  

YOU WILL RECEIVE A PLAYING CARD FACE DOWN. YOU MAY LOOK AT IT BUT SHOW NO ONE ELSE.
 
HEARTS ARE TRUE ADMIRERS OF SUPERCOMPUTER. 

DIAMONDS ARE IDOLATERS OF MONEY THEY HAD BEFORE SUPERCOMPUTER. 

SPADES ARE HARD WORKERS FOR SUPERCOMPUTER. 

CLUBS WANT TO REBEL AGAINST SUPERCOMPUTER.

EACH PLAYER MUST DISCUSS THEIR LIVES UNDER THE RULE OF SUPERCOMPUTER. YOU MUST PRAISE SUPERCOMPUTER.

YOU CANNOT ADDRESS YOUR SUIT BY NAME. 

HEARTS AND SPADES MUST DESTROY ANY DIAMONDS AND CLUBS. 

CLUBS AND DIAMONDS WANT TO DESTROY HEARTS AND SPADES AND KILL SUPERCOMPUTER.

AT ANY POINT A PLAYER MAY ACCUSE ANOTHER PLAYER OF BEING DISLOYAL TO SUPERCOMPUTER. 

IF A MAJORITY AGREE, THAT PLAYER IS KILLED AND IS INTEGRATED INTO SUPERCOMPUTER. 

PLAYERS INTEGRATED INTO SUPERCOMPUTER WEIGH IN ON VOTES BUT CANNOT VOTE. 

AT ANY POINT A PLAYER MAY VOTE TO REVEAL ALL CARDS. THE VOTE MUST BE UNANIMOUS.

IF YES, REVEAL ALL CARDS. 

YOU MUST REVEAL CARDS IF THERE ARE ONLY TWO PLAYERS. 

IF THERE ARE ANY DIAMONDS OR CLUBS, ALL HUMANS DIE AS HUMANS CANNOT BE TRUSTED. 

IF THERE ARE ONLY CLUBS AND DIAMONDS, SUPERCOMPUTER DIES. 

IF THERE ARE ONLY HEARTS AND SPADES, SUPERCOMPUTER WINS.

# Beyond the Howling Sands
```
Embers of your lives flutter down behind you. The town is gone, although for now icy flames still roar and shadowy beasts roam the ruins. No turning back. At least you still have one another and, perhaps beyond the howling sands, a new home. 

3-5 people play a family of survivors crossing a vast desert. Explain your relationship to the person on your right. ("I am Talibah, estranged aunt of Mahdi"). All players roll 2D6. These represent items salvaged as you fled.

The GM sets 1D6+3 obstacles to your journey (bickering, crevasse, Apep, etc.), each a 10min sand-timer long. Give up your resources to overcome them, spending your pre-rolled dice to beat target numbers. Describe the item and aspect it represents of the life you left behind. You may take another player's dice if you can justify this through your familial relationship. All discussions in character.

Fail to overcome an obstacle in time or complete all obstacles and the game ends. 
Failed obstacle: Describe the final action you take towards the family member to your left.
Obstacles complete: Describe your remaining items. How do you use them to build a new life? Who with?
```
<hr>

# Abyssal Zone
```
In Abyssal Zone, each player is captain of a submarine, going into the Abyss to find relics. When you start, each player draws 5 playing cards. The suit of each card is its module on your submarine. 

Clubs = Weapons
Hearts = Life Support
Diamonds = Armor
Spades = Propulsion

The game works in 5-round increments. To start, each player chooses a card, says how it could delay another player, rolls 1d6 + the card's number, (Aces are 1, face cards are 10) and discards the card. 

After that, each player chooses a card, says how it could protect them, rolls 1d6 + the card's number, and discards the card. If that number is lower than the attacker's, the defender has a -1 penalty in the 3rd round. This cycle repeats in the 2nd round.

In the 3rd round, each player attempts to defeat the relic's Challenge (automaton guards, forcefield, etc.). To defeat the challenge, everyone chooses a card and rolls 2d6 + the card's number. The highest result gets the relic.

The last 2 rounds function identically to the first two, but if the defender has the relic and gets a lower number, the relic goes to the attacker.

# On a 1 to 10 scale, how much do you love me?
```
We're a couple. We love each other. But how strong is our love?

To track the evolution of our relationship, we'll use a graph.
The abscissa 'x' measures time (month1, month2,...). The ordinate 'y' measures how close/distant we are (0-6).
We begin at 0,0.

Scenes
Each scene spans one month. We'll play twelve months.

One of us rolls 1d6 to frame the scene:
1. Kids' room
2. On vacation
3. Bedroom
4. With friends
5. With family
6. Hospital

Then, we each roll 1d6 to define our goal:
1. Reveal a hidden truth
2. Ask a loaded question
3&4. Discuss a problem
5. Reveal something personal
6. Demand a change

Finally, we each roll 1d6 to alter our measure:
1&2. y=y-1 (min=0)
3. y=y
4&5. y=y+1
6. y=y+2

Crisis
If we get the same goal, it's a crisis. We yell and say mean things.
Our measures reset accordingly to the die (if we get a 5, then y=5).

Breakup
If someone reaches +7, we break up.
We jump to the epilogue.

Epilogue
We say how we see our future, together or not.

# High-Stakes Run
```
Runner: Name and describe your avatar. One last push separates you and your target, a corporate server. What have you risked for this chance?

Architect: You designed three pieces of ICE, defensive programs, guarding this server. Describe one of each type:
		Type 		Examples 			Goal
		Obstacle 	wall, defender, tempest 	BLOCK
		Sentry		guards, trap, alarm 		ATTACK
		Enigma     	puzzle, illusion, maze 		CONFUSE
		
--------------------------------------------------------------
For each ICE:
-Architect describes it and the danger it poses. 
-Runner initiates an ICEbreaker, detailing its appearance and function. Share a memory related to its creation or use.
-Each ICE gives three chances to win successes. Narrate each success gained or lost together, blow by blow.

Obstacle: Roll a d6, success on 3+. Make three rolls.
Sentry: Architect places 3d6 on a table. Runner flicks a d6 at each from 1 foot, success per hit.
Enigma: Architect takes 4d6, and hides 0-2. Runner guesses amount, then discard used dice and hide twice more. Success per correct guess.	

Successes		->	Outcome
0 			-> 	Run ends, with major consequences. 
1			-> 	Continue, with consequence.
2 			-> 	Continue.
3 			-> 	Continue, Runner gains new knowledge or improvements.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Run Completed: Architect describes the server's appearance. Runner reveals their target, and shares why it matters. What happens?

# Lost Colony
```
Players: 3-8
You are colonists on a dwarf planet with limited resources. Can your group survive or will you run out resources?

Use a tower of wooden blocks, sometimes referred to as a tower of Jenga blocks. 

Each player is a colonist with basic needs to live. The tower represents the ecology & state of the colony. If it collapses, everyone dies. How long can the group survive? 

At game start, each player pulls 2 blocks from tower and keeps them in front of them. 
On each player's turn, they can CONSUME or PRESERVE. 

ACTION EACH TURN: 
If you start your turn with less than 2 blocks, you must choose CONSUME.

CONSUME: Take a block from the tower. Each player must have a minimum of 2 blocks to be considered sustained. Pull blocks until at 2 blocks. Can hold up to 5 blocks. Describe what resource your colonist consumes to stay alive. 
- or - 
PRESERVE: Put a block back onto the tower. Describe what your colonist does to preserve the ecosystem of the planet or colony. 

After everyone has a turn, everyone puts one block back onto the tower. Your wastes create new nutrients.

# The Lone Car Beset
```
You are all bound to The Car.

Pick one each.
Chained: You are tied to The Car. Why must you not be trusted?
Faithful: The Car has holy purpose. Why do the Pursuers covet it?
Fearful: You need The Car to escape the Horde. What are they?
Glorious: The Car will bolster your legend. Why is the Wasteland a worthy challenge?

When you act to survive roll 1d6.
On a 6 you succeed.
On a 3-5 you succeed but your bond is hurt or a threat advances.
On a 1-2 a threat advances or you break your bond and succeed anyway.

If your bond is hurt 5 times it is broken, ending your part in the story.

Threats: Horde, Wasteland, Pursuers
Each Threat has a position; Distant, Closing, or Impending that advances as you try to escape.
If an Impending Threat advances it hurts The Car and reverts to Closing.

If The Car is hurt 5 times the story ends.

If there are 5 success The Car escapes, for now, reducing all Threats to Distant.
If you escape 3 times The Car reaches The City and the end of the story.

Which Threat is Closing right now?

# Hidden Stewards of the Dead Art
```
The Age of Magic has ended, but here you are - a gang of brilliant, charming, experienced, murderous sorcerers. Choose who is Daznan, Kiffel, Necklace of Ants, Rua. Decide which adjective best describes you. Explain why. Choose which facts apply to each of you:

I'm pursued by Ghatshen, half-ghost magic-hunter.
I owe a deep debt to Iku, an unseeing princess.
I lust for the secrets of Hardeen, a dog butcher.
Moyolehuani, beast of legend, is both lover and enemy.

When you use magic, a weird tattoo covers part of your body commensurate with the power of the spell. Temporary light? Pinprick dot. Fireball? Plate-sized mark. Something even grander? More skin.

Draw a silhouette of your character, front and back. Add ink now - cover 70% - if you are experienced, add more. Brilliant? Add less. Magic is always successful, and only limited by your creativity, nerve, and unmarked flesh.

You are the last of your kind. In Yosol magic is a crime. In Chullwa it is merely reviled. Everywhere it is feared. When the marks become obvious everyone will know you, and when every bit of skin is covered that's it - no more magic for you. Until then, try to do good.

You are a group of farmers fleeing the Dust Bowl for work in California.

Materials: 1 Index card per player, 2 six-sided dice, 1 deck of cards

Character creation
Write down your character's name. Where are they from?
Write down the farming skill your character specializes at. You roll 2d6 when performing that action. All other actions roll 1d6. How did your character learn this?
In secret, write down whether you are communist or capitalist. Why is your character this way?

Each day, you may perform any 2 actions. How do these actions help you on the trip? On a 6+, you succeed at the action and draw a card. on a 12+, draw 2.
You may spend an action to assist another's action, adding +1 to the roll. This counts as a failed roll for you. How do you sacrifice for their success?
If you fail rolls on 3 consecutive days, you die or are left behind. How are you remembered?

After 14 days, you reach California. If the Communists collectively have more red cards than the capitalists, they win. Otherwise, the Capitalist with the most Face cards wins. What is the legacy you create that persists?

# How did we drift this far apart?
```
Make sure both players have a list of the provided questions.

The two of you have known each other for a long time.
So long that your relationship isn't the same anymore.

Sit or stand back to back.
For just a moment, stay silent.

Either one of you may ask the first question to break the silence. The other one replies and finishes by asking the next question. You both may talk, argue, ask, answer, hold hands or whatever at all times, but should always follow up on the questions in the list directed at you.

Alternate between asking and replying to the questions, until the last one. When the final question is said, turn around and face each other.
Don't say anything.
Do what you feel is necessary.

Questions:
1. Why did you hurt me?
2. Why weren't you there when I needed you?
3. Are you sorry for what you've done?
4. Do you understand how I've felt?
5. How did we end up here?
6. Do you remember when we were happy?
7. What's your fondest memory of us?
8. What do you regret?
9. Do you still love me?

# Let's get Commemorative Tattoos!!!
```
You've successfully completed your latest dungeon crawl and your adventuring party has decided you must all obtain commemorative tattoos. While most tattoos are purely decorative, some brave (or foolhardy) adventurers may opt for tattoos of a more magical nature -- a ward, hex, glyph of summoning, or otherwise. Some rumors speak of magical tattoos bursting into flames, rejecting the host and becoming their own entity or other such mutations.
--------
Players choose a name and grand title, a dungeoneering profession, and a preferred late night snack (to eat while debating).
	
Each player lists tattoo ideas on (number of players) +1 separate slips of paper. 

All ideas are placed into the pot.

The person least likely to get a tattoo will be the first person to pick from their party's suggestions.

Everyone else picks two slips from the pot, and combines them to make a base for their proposed tattoo design (elaboration is encouraged). To win over your comrades, tie the design into your previous adventure. Each player pitches their idea to their uncertain target. 

The player being pitched to must decide which of the pitches they are be willing to get. Rotate and repeat until everyone has a commemorative tattoo.

# Pollice verso
```
You are a gladiator, together, a Ludus.

Describe your equipment and style.  What foreign battle or local crime caused them to become a gladiator, damnati, or noxii? Detail how you respect any Gods, your placement in the Ludus and Roman society. 

Rank these attributes, 1 to 3. 

Power:  physicality, violence
Presence:  charisma, manipulation
Prestige:  class, politics

Resolving challenges: roll 1d6 + attribute + spent Denarius.  A 5+ indicates a success with a cost (complication, tragedy, wounding) a 7+ indicates a complete success. 

Play begins in the Colosseum. One Gladiator faces challenges while the other players take turns as the editor and present challenges.  Colosseum challenges are combats, theatrical battles, beast hunts, naval engagements, chariot races, religious ceremonies and public executions.  Conquering a challenge earns Denarii per Presence.  

After addressing all challenges, another Gladiator enters the arena until their stories are told. 

Repeat this cycle in the Ludus.  Challenges here are rivals, politicians, patricians, lovers, slavery, and the false fleeting hope of freedom. Handling a challenge earns Denarii per Prestige.  Challenges against other players take their coin.

Taking wounds greater than Power courts death.

Manumission costs 20 Denarii, munificence 40.
