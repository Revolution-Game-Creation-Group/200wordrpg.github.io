# Copycat: A Cyberpunk Game
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: ableism !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A part of you has been replaced by a mechanical copy. The Company repairs your copies and leave you with massive debts.

Choose which job you do to pay The Company: Espionage, Bodyguarding, Hacking, Assassination, Something Else. You don't want to do this job but it is the only way. For now.

Determine which stat (Awareness, Agility, Might) your copy helps, and which it hinders. The stat your copy helps has 3, the one it hinders has 1. The other stat has 2.

When the outcome of something is uncertain, roll the appropriate stat in d6s. If your job is relevant, add 1d6. If your copy is broken, replace 1d6 with 1d4. If you are wounded, remove 1d6. If you act against The Company, add 1d6.
	See which dice has the highest number. If the highest number is a 5 or 6, you do what you wanted. On a 3 or 4, what you do has cost you or you don't get exactly what you want. On a 1 or 2, you fail. 
If your highest number has doubles, something lucky happens.

The Company thinks that because you're a Copycat, you're disposable. Prove them wrong.

# Shit, The World Is Ending!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Ideally you should have 1 week set aside before playing because the game starts as soon as you begin reading the rules- this is to prevent over preparing for the game and taking all of the fun out of it. This is a game about being resourceful with what you have. *The author is not responsible for any damages, injuries, or deaths caused by playing this game. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Your phone starts blaring an alarm... Annnnnd BOOM! You just got an alert saying the world ends in one hour! You have that time, starting right this instant, to gather and prepare food, water, and other supplies.

At the end of that hour, you no longer have conventional electricity, running water, or access to networks/infrastructure. If you have to leave to get more supplies and are not back within that hour, you are presumed dead.

Over the next week, you have to ration those few supplies you saved.

The game ends in one week or when you/all players give up.

"Giving up" signifies death.

You lose if you die before the week is up.

# Open Mic at a Funeral
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, disrespect for the dead !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A terrible game for 5+ people.
 
You are at the funeral for someone you barely knew. You were not personally invited, but it was an open invitation. Those who were officially asked to speak have said their words, and now it's time for the open mic. A facilitator must tally points and keep time to ensure everyone speaks for five long, uncomfortable minutes.
 
Speakers gain five points per each of the following:
·      Make a statement about how you don't want to take up too much time.
·      Sneak in an admission about how little you interacted with the deceased.
·      Incorporate an object into your speech. Ex: a paperclip the deceased once loaned you.
·      Tell an inappropriate story about the deceased.
·      Tell an utterly boring story about an interaction with the deceased.
·      Make an impossibly grand statement about how much the deceased meant to you.
·      Fake cry.
·      Humble-brag.
·      Incorporate an impromptu performance about the deceased that you are ill-prepared for.
·      Claim you share something with the deceased that nobody else does.
 
Players may refer to the list. The game is over once everyone has had a turn to speak. Whoever has the most points wins.

# Finely Marbled

 
```
You are lab-grown meat companies in a reasonably advanced future, seeking to impress the finicky customer.

( Table Setting )

The person who last ate meat is the Arbiter; if none, then whoever last read a cut of writing. The game begins as the Arbiter sits at a dining surface. Other players scavenge the environment for pieces of writing as raw material, or construct their own.

( Creation )

The Arbiter hungers. Players construct steaks by rendering writing with scissors into word clusters representing muscle, and infuse fat by kerning the gaps between. Serve on a mobile platter at the table when ready, in an orderly queue.

( Dining )

The Arbiter reads each steak out loud in the orientation they choose, along the grain. Take time to chew both sinew and silence. Feel the contour of the steak and the shape of words as they form in the mouth. Describe its floral and vegetal tasting notes, its tone and marbling, the literature it evokes. Steaks that satisfy the Arbiter's craving are kept at the table (all players are encouraged to consume for market research). Others are recycled to the creator.

The game ends when the Arbiter is sated with a full table of worthy cuts.

# Hitman
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: "Assassinations" "Poisons" !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The Hitman is a dangerous assassin that kills their target no matter what. Tonight is a dinner party, there are a lot of guests but two of them are marked for assassination. The guests know ahead of time that the Hitman is coming but they don't know who are the targets. They must find out who is the Hitman and stop him before he'll assassinate both targets.

There would be rooms and all players would be randomly assigned by dice to different rooms each turn. Each room will vote on whether they should kill someone inside or not, and who. Resolve voting stalemates using dice. After the first turn, a card is left in each room. These cards are clues guests can choose to pick up. If the guests collect enough cards, they unveil the Hitman's identity and win. However, the Hitman can lace a card in the same room as him with a deadly poison. Any guest that picks up the poisoned card immediately dies. Only one card can be poisoned at a time, and it stays there until another card has been poisoned.

# Wherefore

 
```
A game of strong constitutions, for several players.
 
Together, establish scale:  Nations?  People?  Cats?  Ants?
 
Each describe your own purpose.  A single sentence, perhaps two.  This is your raison d'être.  Your "Wherefore".
 
Divide six points between Original Intent, and Flexible Interpretation.
 
Together, describe your relationships, ambitions, and plots.  Make up actions you might take until some action is contentious.

Other players decide if you are acting within the intent of your stated purpose.  If so, roll against the value of your intent.  Otherwise, against Flexibility.  If needed, you act as the tie breaker.

If you roll equal or under, you have the presence and purpose necessary for success.  Good job.
 
If you roll over, you lack the focus, clarity of intent, or will to be successful.  Maybe you didn't try hard enough, prepare enough, or want it enough.

Choose the reason for your failure.  This becomes a defining quality of your character, and colors the way others interact with you.
 
Record any success or failure as precedent.  A majority of the players may cite precedent to declare that you automatically succeed or fail in any similar endeavor you attempt in the future.  If needed, you may be a tie breaker.
