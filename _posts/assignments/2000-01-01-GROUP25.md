# Copycat: A Cyberpunk Game
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: ableism !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A part of you has been replaced by a mechanical copy. The Company repairs your copies and leave you with massive debts.

Choose which job you do to pay The Company: Espionage, Bodyguarding, Hacking, Assassination, Something Else. You don't want to do this job but it is the only way. For now.

Determine which stat (Awareness, Agility, Might) your copy helps, and which it hinders. The stat your copy helps has 3, the one it hinders has 1. The other stat has 2.

When the outcome of something is uncertain, roll the appropriate stat in d6s. If your job is relevant, add 1d6. If your copy is broken, replace 1d6 with 1d4. If you are wounded, remove 1d6. If you act against The Company, add 1d6.
	See which dice has the highest number. If the highest number is a 5 or 6, you do what you wanted. On a 3 or 4, what you do has cost you or you don't get exactly what you want. On a 1 or 2, you fail. 
If your highest number has doubles, something lucky happens.

The Company thinks that because you're a Copycat, you're disposable. Prove them wrong.

# The Heffalumps Graveyard

 
```
You play characters near the end of childhood, whose spirits journey through the land of dreams accompanying your corporeal toy companion to its final resting place in the fabled Heffalumps Graveyard, while avoiding the clutches of the villainous China Doll, the spare-part pirate. 

Gain access to the graveyard by getting past the guardian, a giant black dog, Mr Sausages. He talks with a refined accent and only lets the worthiest toys in. Lay your toy to rest & mature, or refuse and stay young forever.

Each player describes a treasured toy and names it. The group agrees which two skills the toy confers. For example:

Teddy: Grapple, forage
Action man: eagle eyes, opposable thumbs
Evil Kneivel: drive, jump
Robot: Logic, strength
My Little Pony: ride, kick
Dolly: etiquette, charm
Stretch Armstrong: reach, resist wounds

For any challenge the players roll 1D6 and an additional 1D6 for each applicable skill. Use the best roll as the result
Fail: 1 - 3
Success: 4 - 6

Sample encounters:
===========================
Buckaroo's rodeo challenge
Kerplunk - the marble tsunami
The snakes and the ladders
Sand pit dunes
Plastic dinosaur stampede
Beanie baby jungle
Hungry hungry Hippos
Meccanno bridge
Tamagotchi menagerie with  transformer zookeeper
Skeletors Bouncy Castle

# Rising Tides
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Apocalypse, Tsunamis !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The globe warmed. The ocean invaded your city and its people fled, but you could or would not follow them. You surf the waves atop its sunken streets to survive.

The Fibonacci Sequence tracks your Will to Live. You start at 0.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

When the tsunami comes you abandon your crumbling home and take to the skyscraper-gridded waterways, roll (1d6 x 10) + 1d6 to surf for your life. If you roll lower than your current Will, the tsunami consumes you and your board. 

Survival is pain. If you survive a tsunami, advance your Sequence by 4 steps. Start the game with a tsunami.

Between tsunamis, you strain to establish a home. After each of the following acts, roll 1d6. On a 6, another tsunami ravages the city.

If you selflessly comfort another survivor, advance your Sequence by 1 step and retreat theirs by 1.

If you search for meaning, roll 1d6. On a 2 or lower, you find something of beauty and retreat your Sequence by 1. On a 3 or higher, you find something of stabbing nostalgia and loss and advance your Sequence by 1.

# The Ultimate Kraken Festival
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Ocean, Aquatic Life, Abyssal Gigantism !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The table works to appease The Kraken. 

Gameplay is two parts: First, players gather items to appease The Kraken. Second, players ensure the success of the annual festival. 

The game only needs 1d6+(stat mod) rolls to complete easy(5), medium(6), or hard(7) tasks. DM can increase difficulty.

Character Creation: Roll 1d6 for each stat-this is both total and modifier.
Arms
Noggin
Squish
Hide
Swim
Style
Morals

Part One
DM tells a legend that indicates the Kraken's likes & dislikes. Based on this legend, the players announce what they will each gather for the festival. Players can help each other-or sabotage each other if they think another player's idea won't appease. The DM presents at least one obstacle for each effort to gather.

Part Two
Players attend the festival and must ensure optimum festivities. Each must contribute to the festival in some way. DM presents one problem at the festival per player.

Ending: Kraken Judgment
At the appropriate time in the festival, the Kraken evaluates the offerings gathered and the quality of the festivities. If the Kraken is appeased, the Kraken slumbers for another year. If the Kraken is displeased, there is a Kraken Rampage.

# FUN IS BANNED

 
```
Components: d4, d6

3+ players: One is Judge, rest are citizens.
Judge picks first citizen to interrogate, asks how their day was.
First citizen rolls dice, talks about their day at [LOCATION] with [PERSON].

LOCATION is determined by 1d4 roll:
	1- Party
	2- Beach
	3- Concert
	4- Amusement Park
 PERSON is determined by 1d6 roll:
	1- Significant other
	2- Best friend
	3- Your clone
	4- 1d6 clones
	5- Canadian Prime Minister
	6- Any religious deity

Other citizens are terrified of Judge, and will sabotage speaker to save themselves.
Each other citizen may interject once and add to the story, hindering the speaking citizen. Speaking citizen incorporates and explains additions to satisfactory degree, determined by Judge.

Topics like domestic/sexual abuse shouldn't be used. Players may decide on other banned topics before play.

If speaking citizen is ever happy in their story, Judge takes them away for breaking the law.
If anyone else in speaking citizen's story appears to be happy, Judge takes them away for failure to report a crime.

If story is satisfactory, Judge deems the citizen innocent, and it's the next citizen's turn to be interrogated. Play continues until all citizens have been interrogated.

# We collaterally effected (a warm-up game)

 
```
We play those, whose lives were altered, but who where ignored by the narrative for far.

Recount the events from the last RPG session.

Everyone rolls D20s. Re-roll to break ties. Game order: high -> low.
The first player describes a non-exclusive meeting place, like a pub.

Then, one by one, every player (starting with the pub describer):
* ... thinks of a reasonable effect of the events, that have gone largely unnoticed so far.
* ... chooses or comes up with a figure in the story, that has been strongly impacted by that effect.
* ... portrays and plays that figure, telling her story.

... while listening to her story, the other, attentive player place tokens (dice work) in front of the talking player, whenever:
* the narration is surprising, but fits the setting
* the player now feels differently about aspects of the events
* the portrayal of the figure brings the setting to life

Everyone counts the tokens they got.
The players with the most tokens are encouraged to narrate a moment during the evenings main game where their figures from this warm-up game -by pure happenstance- creates a small, positive situation; the figure distracting a suspicious guard for a moment, for example. Subject to GM/table veto.

# Pigeon? Impossible!

 
```
You are an elite infiltration/exfiltration team composed of pigeons. 

Choose a name, a skill (e.g. explosives, hacking, wing-to-wing combat), a weakness.

Give each pigeon 3 cards. Write on each a pigeon-y action (e.g. bristling feathers, unexpected defecation). 

PM Questions

- What is your target? 
- What protects it? 
- What are you after? 

Use their answers to challenge the team.

Pigeons are small and the world is large; success requires fast, silent, coordination.

When an obstacle is encountered every pigeon will suggest a plan. The PM will secretly rank the plans (1 is best).

Each pigeon will indicate their preferred plan using a card. No other communication is allowed. Then they will secretly and simultaneously commit to a plan.

For each mission roll 1d6: 

For every pigeon on the mission;
For every pigeon that uses their skill;
If plan creator chose it;
If the plan was described using only cards. 

Subtract 1d6 for every pigeon that exposes their weakness.
 
A success is a 4+. A mission succeeds if the number of successes exceeds the plan's rank. 

If a mission succeeds the team progresses. Failures cause complications and every failure increases the next missions' success requirement by one.
