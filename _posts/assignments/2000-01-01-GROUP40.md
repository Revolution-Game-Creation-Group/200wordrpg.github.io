# The Stars, Our Constellations

 
```
Each player draws 15 to 25 stars on the same piece of paper with pencils.

Then each player takes turns drawing lines between 5 and 10 stars to make a constellation.  Constellation lines cannot cross any other constellation lines.  Players continue to take turns until everyone has added two constellations, or there are no more clusters of at least 5 stars available.

Once all constellations have been created, the First Age starts.

During the First Age, all constellations and stand-alone stars are given names.  On their turn, each player gives one constellation or star a name.  Continue, rotating between players, until all are named.

Rotate again, this time each player gives a named constellation or star a story.  Once all constellations and stars have stories, the Second Age begins.

In the Second Age, half the constellations shift.  Go through each constellation and decide if it changed by adding new lines.  One player proposes a new name, while other players provide a new story, and a brief history why it changed.

The game ends once every changed constellation has a new story.

Example Names:

Crown of the North
The Investigator
Scythe's Handle
The First One
Varnek, the Winter Moose
Scorpion's Face

In year 20XY, superpowered people emerged within the society, but society doesn't like them. Your group is made up of several.

You have two stats - Power and Injury. Power is any number between 2 and 11, 11 meaning your superpowers are strongest they could be, but that you suck at other things. Injury starts at 1, +1 for each injury you receive. If it reaches 13, you die. It resets after sleeping for 8 hours.

Everyone picks one thing to control. It must be made up of particles, so fire, biomass, neon, and electricity are okay, but time, life, or force aren't. No two players should have the same powers.

Whenever you need to do a task, roll 2d6 or 1d12. When involving your superpowers in task, you need to roll below Power to succeed. If you can't involve superpowers, you need to roll over Power to succeed. If you roll below your Injury, you fail automatically. When you use your superpowers, describe how. Game Master (GM) must approve your use of superpowers. Follow the Rule of Cool.

GM controls everything else by rules above. Change starting Injury for harder or easier to defeat NPCs. Have fun!

# Wordhunger

 
```
This is a game for two people-myself, and a partner. It should never be played with an empty meal, such as when my partner is a mirror or a photograph.
We'll sit together, you and I, and lock our aching hands together. You can begin. Stare silently into my eyes for as long as you can bear, until words begin to come crawling out of your mouth. Describe me, fully, as what you see before you. You're not here to bolster my ego, or to dig deep against my insecurities. I am your teleprompter. Your tongue shapes me.
Describe my jawline, jutting forward. Describe my skin, stubble bursting. Describe my off-white teeth, my thin gums, my tired hair. Describe my eyes as I listen to you say these words. Describe my tears, describe my smile, describe how I look when I try to look away. Call me what you want. See me. 
With your teeth and lips and alveolar ridge and dagger tongue, tear against my soft skin.
Once you have finished, and you are full of me, I can do the same for you, and we can feast together on what remains.

# Rubik's Labyrinth

 
```
You have each been kidnapped and abandoned by the GM in a labyrinth controlled by a magic cube. You party up to try escape.
Have the GM scramble a Rubik's Cube and place it down. 
This is the 'gameboard'. Players start at the top-right and end at the bottom-left tile, moving in an 'S' shape.

Players create their character by choosing descriptors - name, 1 equip, 2 attributes.
The GM assigns a power value to each tile colour:
Sum of all (six) colours' values <= no. players times 6. 
Maximum colour value equals no. players times 3.

Each turn, the GM creates the conflict, using the tile's colour as a prompt. Players cooperate to create a plan of action that must incorporate a number of descriptors >= the colour's power value. Planning time = 15 times no. players in seconds.

If the party wins, they describe the outcome and move to the next tile.
If the party loses, GM describes the outcome and rotates 3 rows/columns. Then the party moves back one tile (move forward instead if on first tile).

When rotating, the party stays on their tile. Afterwards, their tile should face up. 

Party wins when the bottom-left tile's conflict is resolved.

# You bloody shot me!

 
```
You bloody shot me!

A drug deal gone wrong. An abandoned building. A gang of bleeding criminals. A bag full of cash.

Each player needs 
-	D6. 
-	Pin.  
-	Balloon full of water.

Look to your left, give that player a "codename" of any object in sight that is their character.

Each player holds their full balloon above the table, this is your Health. At the start of the game each player takes their pin and puts a hole in the balloon of the player on their right, this is your wound.

If a player's balloon empties, they are gone and their dice is removed.

Dice must stay in the middle of the table. To overcome an obstacle, roll all the dice. 
To succeed each dice needs to roll 4+ you can re-roll failures as many times as needed.

Use your free hand to try and cover the hole in your balloon or use your pin to add holes to other players balloons.

If you put down your balloon you can take no actions.

Get out of the building alive with the cash and escape while the GM throws obstacles in between you and the getaway van.

SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR THE FROZEN TOWER-CITY OED
===============================================

The GUIDE will lead you.

When you RISK something, establish CONSEQUENCES together.
   ACCEPT, AVOID, or SUGGEST A COMPROMISE for each or FAIL.

AVOID CONSEQUENCES by ROLLING your D20 bellow your STAMINA.

CONSEQUENCES may be missed OPPORTUNITIES 
   or have no COMPROMISE.

Circumstances may impose or grant REROLLS 
   and/or CONSEQUENCES.

Subtract HARM from STAMINA,
   then AVOID getting KOed. 

Spend LUCK to negate HARM.

SAFE RESTS recover STAMINA.

BREAKS refill LUCK. 

Discuss, continue.
