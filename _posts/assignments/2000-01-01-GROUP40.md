# The Stars, Our Constellations

 
```
Each player draws 15 to 25 stars on the same piece of paper with pencils.

Then each player takes turns drawing lines between 5 and 10 stars to make a constellation.  Constellation lines cannot cross any other constellation lines.  Players continue to take turns until everyone has added two constellations, or there are no more clusters of at least 5 stars available.

Once all constellations have been created, the First Age starts.

During the First Age, all constellations and stand-alone stars are given names.  On their turn, each player gives one constellation or star a name.  Continue, rotating between players, until all are named.

Rotate again, this time each player gives a named constellation or star a story.  Once all constellations and stars have stories, the Second Age begins.

In the Second Age, half the constellations shift.  Go through each constellation and decide if it changed by adding new lines.  One player proposes a new name, while other players provide a new story, and a brief history why it changed.

The game ends once every changed constellation has a new story.

Example Names:

Crown of the North
The Investigator
Scythe's Handle
The First One
Varnek, the Winter Moose
Scorpion's Face

# Small Spaces

 
```
You're the first group of humans to live long term in outer space. 

Describe what you live in, is it a small dome, ship, or station? 
What supplies do you have? 
What supplies are you lacking? 

Introduces yourself 
- What's your job? 
- Why you're here?
- How do you feel about someone you work with? 
- How you spend your free time? 


How to play 

Each player takes two notecards and writes a complication word on one and an emotional word on the other. These words are the themes for each scene. Place the cards in the middle of the group and have someone start by pulling a card. They're the narrator for this scene as it will be from their point of view. They must use the word on the card to come up with and act out an event that happens during the first week living as a group. The scene can be just them or whoever they want to be in it with them. There is no limit on how many people are in a scene. Each pull from the deck is a new week, then on the second round a new month until you end on the last card.

[Two players.]

INPATIENT, here is what you know:
* Your mind is a wound, grievous and profane.
* You must become a tourniquet.

HOSPITAL, when INPATIENT approaches an Inquisitor (psychiatrist, orderly, or otherwise) for help with their symptoms, portray the Inquisitor and its lair: gleeful, mazelike, ceremonious, gnashing, weeping, spine-laden, phantasmagoric, booooorrred!!, or otherwise.

Have it prescribe a treatment:
* "Spin your afflictions into finery."
* "Arrange your brain meat like a pretty bouquet."
* "Swallow the worm of absolution at the meds window in plain view."
* "Swap neuroses with a fellow patient."
* "Grind a prickly memory to powder, then blow."
* "Just exercise! ...in the Maceration Chamber, of course."

INPATIENT, describe how you obey the prescription and flip a coin.
* Heads: The treatment nearly maims you, but somehow you make it useful. How?
* Tails: It maims you, but you learn to love something about your mind. What?

Your symptoms manifest daily. Seek help from Inquisitors.

HOSPITAL, once INPATIENT has obeyed five prescriptions, say their insurance coverage has expired and depict the Discharge Process.

INPATIENT, you come home to your dingy flat in throbbing Ten-Temper Town, to all your adoring cats. Feed them. Hold them.

Are you a tourniquet yet? What do you want to be?

# Building the Rainbow Bridge
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Pet Loss !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Players are family, maybe blood relatives, maybe not. Say your name, your age, your relationship to your left-hand neighbor. Everyone puts a heads-up coin on the table.

Red
Your pet enters your lives. Everyone says a few sentences about their first day with the pet. Turn to tails when you've had your say.

Orange
The pet chooses its name. Suggest one, explain why, then turn to heads. After, everyone flips coins- heads eliminated, tails are contenders. Flip contenders until one's left. Zero tails? Do-over.

Yellow
The honeymoon's new and lovely: temperaments revealed, boundaries tested, behavior learned. Everyone flips. Share an unquestionably good (heads) or questionably good (tails) thing your pet does.

Green
is a little later. Everyone says one word in turn, making a story about the good, comfortable times. Repeat as needed.

Blue
is later yet. Everyone says one sentence, telling the story of the decline. Stack your coins together.

Indigo
is the end. Take a moment. Then, everyone tells about their last day with your pet. Take a coin when done. Your pet dies when the coins are gone. Breathe. Cry together or alone.

Violet
is a year later. How do you feel?


Once you're ready: play again.
