# Mice Wearing Tiny Scarves: Winter's End

 
```
Winter rages. The colony is dying. Your party has volunteered to save Spring.
Materials: 
	Markers, 
	Tokens, 
	Bag, 
	Paper.
Each player describes their mouse. (Name, appearance, home, deeds)
The Elder(GM) gives each mouse a title, scarf, and 1 to 3 gifts.
	Cut paper into strips. Mark each strip into 8 boxes. 
	In 1 box each the Elder(GM) writes any gifts, then the character's name + title. 
	The remaining boxes are colored by the player as their scarf. 
	Each player and Elder uniquely mark 1 token - placing them in the bag with 1 blank.

Players work alone or together to perform "Deeds." (Elder can set constraints)
	Draw 1 token, 
		if blank or matching any player involved - Success. 
		Otherwise fail. 
Players face "Peril" from winter, predators, and extreme failures.
	Draw a token from the bag
		If token matches:
			Player involved in "Peril" - That player tears a box off their scarf
				or perishes if no more scarf is left.
			Elder - Elder chooses from involved players.
		Otherwise nothing.
Return tokens after each draw
Pertinent Gifts and Titles allow involved players 1 redraw per "Deed" / "Peril".
Gifts cannot be exchanged or lost.
The Elder(GM) describes each "Deed" / "Peril" and constructs the narrative.

# A Paper Football Game for 2-6 Players
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: N/A !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The players play for an american football team (Quarterback, Receiver, & Defense)

On a piece of easel paper, draw 4 parallel lines to segment the paper into quarters.

Flip a coin to determine which team will start.

The team will have 4 attempts to get the ball past the opposite end of the easel paper (touchdown).

The quarterback will whisper to the receiver what quarter she will try to get the paper football into.

The opposing defense will place her plastic cup into the section she thinks the team will try to throw into.

The receiver will then place her cup into the section her team decided.

If the two cups share the same quarter, they will be placed on their side next to each other.  If they are in different quarters, they will be placed on their side where they are.

The quarterback must try to flick the paper football into the receiver cup.  If it goes into the defense's cup, it is a turnover and the other team plays offense.  If it goes in the receiver cup, play resumes from that point on the paper and that team has 3 more attempts to get a touchdown (7 points).

# You Are Beautiful
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: emotional intensity !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The person with the lightest eyes says: Welcome to this space. This space is safe. I value you, myself, and this space we are sharing. I am ready to be your witness and be witnessed by you.

The person with the darkest eyes then says the same thing back.

Decide who will speak first. The other person will witness.

The speaking person then tells a story from their past, an event or moment they are uncomfortable with, not proud of, or that is a confession of something they feel guilty for. The story can be short, long, or somewhere in between. They may also speak about something they dislike or are insecure about themselves. Give all the context needed. 

Once the story is told and silence is hanging, the witnessing person reaches over, takes the speaking person's hands, holds them gently, looks into their eyes and says, "You are beautiful."

The hands are released once the speaking person says, "Thank you."

The experience proceeds going back and forth until either person says, "Thank you for witnessing me and letting me witness you." 

The other person responds, saying the same, and the experience is over.

# RPG FM

 
```
2 players
Any app where you can play music.

Introduction:

You live in a remote village. It's a nice place, but there's one thing that really bothers you; reception is terrible, there's one single radio network and it only plays an annoying loop where a dull voice reads the local news.

Talking with a friend you come up with a great idea, you'll start a local radio music show. After getting all the materials you meet at your house for your first show.

Rules:

The game starts with players picking a name for their show and defining its personality. Will they play all types of music? What's its logo? At what time will your show end?

Players take turns to play songs they like. Each song should be introduced by the player who chose it, either telling why that song is special to them or providing a fun fact about it. The show goes on following the structure agreed by both players (it could have special sections defined by them). The game ends at the time set by the players, who must say goodbye and remind listeners to tune in again next week.

# Final Voyage

 
```
Year 2122, pollution, global warming, and rapid population growth have planet Earth on the brink of destruction. Over the last century, scientists from around the world have gathered a vast amount of information regarding potentially habitable planets around the universe. However, with most of these planets being so far away, there's no telling for sure how hospitable these new worlds will be to human life. A group of interstellar explorers from different countries and with different skill sets is assembled, they are not the first team to take on this important mission, but previous pioneers were never heard from again. They will navigate the stars on a newly developed spacecraft capable of safely traveling through our known universe, complete with identified galaxies, black holes, constellations, and other wonders and dangers of space. The crew will have to deal with common problems like overcoming mechanical, interpersonal and health issues as well as more serious problems like contamination, mutiny, radiation, meteors, black holes, and many other mysteries of space. The goal of the game is to navigate through space by evaluating clues, avoiding catastrophes, and using the strengths of your crew members to locate and colonize a habitable planet, a new earth.

```
Both:
Narrate all actions; be theatrical.  
 
Sorcerer:
Bind a Demon: write your desires on a defixione (curse tablet). Recite binding. 
 
Demon:
Ripped from your infernal realm, announce your truename and historical misdeeds.
 
Sensing weakness, plunder Sorcerer's memories. Use any image search website. Find three images representing powerful emotional experiences from Sorcerer's lifetime. Use terms: Love, War, Art.
 
Show Sorcerer. 
 
Sorcerer:
Experience memories, full-force.
 
On 3 notecards, write a one-sentence story-your memory of each image. Secretly number each from 1 (strongest) to 3 (weakest), writing number on back. 

Read memories aloud to Demon. 

Shuffle cards and give to Demon, memory-side up.
 
Demon:
For six minutes, interrogate. Use cunning and cruelty; divine Sorcerer's true feelings about each memory. Spellbound, Sorcerer must respond truthfully, in visceral detail.
 
Sorcerer:
Interrogation may surface new emotions. If necessary, re-number cards.
 
Demon:
Use your learnings; arrange memories from strongest to weakest. Declare your reasoning.
 
Both:
Sorcerer, reveal sequence.
 
If Demon numbered all three correctly, the binding fails.
Demon, break Sorcerer's will with memories. Condemn them to their eternal fate.
 
If Demon fails, they are bound.
Sorcerer, tell Demon the menial tasks and great boons you will ask over the next millennia.
