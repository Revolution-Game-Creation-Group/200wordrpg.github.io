# Mice Wearing Tiny Scarves: Winter's End

 
```
Winter rages. The colony is dying. Your party has volunteered to save Spring.
Materials: 
	Markers, 
	Tokens, 
	Bag, 
	Paper.
Each player describes their mouse. (Name, appearance, home, deeds)
The Elder(GM) gives each mouse a title, scarf, and 1 to 3 gifts.
	Cut paper into strips. Mark each strip into 8 boxes. 
	In 1 box each the Elder(GM) writes any gifts, then the character's name + title. 
	The remaining boxes are colored by the player as their scarf. 
	Each player and Elder uniquely mark 1 token - placing them in the bag with 1 blank.

Players work alone or together to perform "Deeds." (Elder can set constraints)
	Draw 1 token, 
		if blank or matching any player involved - Success. 
		Otherwise fail. 
Players face "Peril" from winter, predators, and extreme failures.
	Draw a token from the bag
		If token matches:
			Player involved in "Peril" - That player tears a box off their scarf
				or perishes if no more scarf is left.
			Elder - Elder chooses from involved players.
		Otherwise nothing.
Return tokens after each draw
Pertinent Gifts and Titles allow involved players 1 redraw per "Deed" / "Peril".
Gifts cannot be exchanged or lost.
The Elder(GM) describes each "Deed" / "Peril" and constructs the narrative.

# Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dice

 
```
3-7 players play as celebrity chefs. You each star in your own restaurant review show.

Describe your chef's:
Name
Culinary specialty or dietary restriction
Fashion
Vehicle
Catchphrase

Do not name your show yet.

Players take turns in clockwise order.

On your turn, pick another player to scout a restaurant for you to feature on your show. They describe the restaurant and the kind of food it serves. They then pick another player to play the restaurant's head chef. (This can be their celebrity chef or a new character - their choice.)

The head chef walks you through the preparation of one of their dishes. Feel free to interrupt to ask them to clarify things for the audience or to insert your hilarious catchphrase. Play things up for the camera. You're the star here, not them.

When the head chef is done, roll a d10 to determine how much you enjoy their food. Narrate your reaction as you eat the food on camera.

Once each player has had 2 turns (1 for 5+ players), you must end your episodes. In turn order, give your show's trademark sign-off line to the camera. Be sure to work your show's name into the sign-off.

# Judy was Punched
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Domestic abuse, puppets !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are fleeing Punch, the most terrible puppet of all, trying to find a better life away from him.

He has taken your words away.
You can grunt, mime, gesture and babble but not say any words. You will mainly communicate using your hands and hope you are understood.

When you want to attempt a difficult action, play rock paper scissors with the GM.
If you win, you succeed.
If you fail, you suffer a setback.
If you draw, ask "the audience" a question like "Where is he?" or "What did he do to our baby?". This is the only time a player can speak. The GM answers.

To escape Punch, you need to make friends along the way.

GM: Pick 3 characters from this list. Each one will help the player a little bit but may ask for something in return. 
The Policeman
The Crocodile
The Devil
The Doctor
The Executioner
The Clown 

Once the player has been helped by the three characters, they have their words back and the freedom to exit into the audience. Or they can choose to stay and battle Punch, finally finding the strength to fight back. 

At long last, the choice is theirs.

# Alien Shotgun

 
```
5 Players 

Prep: Arrange 5 chairs in a car layout, driver's side slightly ahead of shotgun. Have 5 playing cards, identify one for the driver, one for the alien. Shuffle and deal cards out, driver sits in driver's seat, alien silently reveals themselves to passengers, tells everyone else where to sit.

Setting: June 1947, on a road on the outskirts of Roswell New Mexico, late at night.

The driver of the car is suspicious that one of their passengers is an alien. But the passengers are under the alien's control, they're not allowed to reveal the alien's identity.

Play: The driver must keep looking forward, eyes on the road thank you, and can only talk to the passengers about idle chit-chat. The alien must give orders to the passengers silently, hand gestures, mouthed words, whatever. Passengers must follow these as best they can, but do nothing else. Every 5 minutes, the alien can knock out one passenger via the cut-throat gesture.

At any time, the driver can kick one passenger out.

If the alien is kicked out before all passengers are knocked out, driver/passengers win. If a passenger is kicked out, or all passengers knocked out, the alien wins.

# The cold grave
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Warning: This entry deals heavily with death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A dark tale for two players.

You're lost at sea, alone in the open water, struggling to survive. It's dark, it's cold. You're terrified. You must stay awake until rescue arrives.
As you slowly freeze, your hallucinated future self appears and urges you to keep fighting.

How to play:
In turns, draw a card and describes a memory associated with its theme. Future self describes events that have not yet happened to you.
When someone draws the card "Death?", decide together if you survive.

Cards:
Death? (epilogue)
A deal with God
Sunset
The most truly fantastic smile
Let me be weak
Not a soul, only me
Under the ivy
Wake up, sleepy head
A stone around my leg
Where the crossroads meet
Never say goodbye
I won't forget
Driving home
Murderer of calm!
Somewhere in the depth there is a light
Born again
Bad dreams
Three wishes
Joy and then more joy
Something moving under
I know your face well
The little line in my palm
Waking up crying
What made it special made it dangerous
I can't hide you
Something good is gonna happen
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?
Peekaboo
Favourite place
Give away a secret

2. assign each die to a sphere

Then each player:

1. narrates, how chosen sphere influences the sphere determined by written value,
2. leads the narration to either negative (1-3) or positive (4-6) conclusion, based on assigned die value.

What about seasons, transportation, trade routes?

## Beasts

Do people hunt beasts and vice versa?

## Culture
What are local traditions, rules? What's their relation to the spheres?
How people behave to themselves and foreigners?

## Individuals
Did any individuals significantly influence the village? Why?
What were the consequences of their deeds?

## Outland
What happens beyond borders?
Describe how religions, wars, and revolutions influence the village.

## Transcendence
How is its presence manifested?
Do other spheres register, control, or crave for it?
