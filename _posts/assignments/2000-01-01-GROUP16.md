# Hush

 
```
A paranoid, conversational game of finding community for 1 Keeper of Silence and 2-5 Strangers. 

The first thing you noticed was the quiet, a rare and heavy phenomenon that has now grown to be your everyday. But you have finally found others and desperately reach for connections, slowly realizing how everyone became so sick...

Strangers each secretly write 5 Desires in this empty world but can never give them voice. Strangers each place a D6 Community Die in front of them set to 2.

The Keeper secretly writes 8 Poisoned Words and begins a 5-minute timer.

Strangers speak of their world, their silence, and ask questions of other Strangers. If any Stranger utters a Poisoned Word, the Keeper will soon give them a token. When the timer runs out, the Keeper writes 2 new Poisoned Words and restarts the timer. When a Stranger states or fulfills another's Desire, it is announced, and the fulfilling Stranger increases their Community Die by 1 and gives 1 token back to the Keeper. That Desire is crossed out.

If all Strangers' Community Dice are set to 6 they have found a new community, home. If any Stranger gets 8 tokens, they perish.

# Drunk Monk
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Alcohol Consumption, Religion !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
God: "You stupid f#$@% monks! You drank too much dang wine! You're no longer pure! You've sullied your souls, and must pilgrimage through treacherous terrain to find the Purity Pond and take a cleansing bath!"

*creates beacon of light in the distance indicating location of the Purity Pond*

Monks: "Oh shoot dang -BELCHh, we're gonna be setting off then."

REQUIRES
d4, d6, d8, d20, bottle caps/tokens, friends and beer

MAKE YOUR MONK
4 points divided across the 3 stats
Body for guesses on any physical actions
Mind for guesses on any mental actions
Heart for heartiness

God declares which dice He will be rolling. Bigger dice = Bigger challenge. He rolls in secret to get the Holy Number. If a monk wants to overcome an obstacle, they must guess the Holy Number. Every time they guess wrong, they must take a drink. 

Finish the beer to succeed even after failing to guess the Holy Number.

d20 is for a Group Action; monks guess the same Holy Number together. If anyone repeats a number, they drink twice for not staying focused.  

If failure means getting hurt (like fighting an ogre, or climbing a cliff) then they lose a Heart.

Drink Responsibly

# Backstage

 
```
It is OPENING NIGHT.

The show is a disaster. Your job is to save it.

There are 2-4 DESIGNERS and a STAGE MANAGER (SM). The SM facilitates the game. Each DESIGNER starts with 1 TIELINE.

The DESIGNERS are the: Lighting DESIGNER, Sound DESIGNER, Set DESIGNER, Costume DESIGNER.

Each DESIGNER selects a quirk and then reveals simultaneously. If a quirk is shared, DESIGNERS are (rivals/dating).
     1. Neon hair
     2. Colored clothes
     3. Heavy accent
     4. Band shirt
     5. Coffee drinker
     6. Former actor

Decide the show together. Mockery is encouraged. 
     1. Shakespeare
     2. Musical
     3. Community Theatre
     4. Off-off-Broadway
     5. One-person show
     6. Greek tragedy

The SM (with suggestions from DESIGNERS) narrates the the show. 4+ things go wrong.

When you try to fix something the actors messed up, roll 2d6+TIELINE.

     * On a 10+, it works better than the original. Gain one TIELINE. 
     * On a 7-9, it works, but there's a problem. The SM offers you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
     * On a 6-, it gets a lot worse.

After curtain call, all DESIGNERS vent, and then read the reviews. 

The DESIGNER with most TIELINE is mentioned. The rest are not.

# The boys are back in town

 
```
A game for 1+ players.

The boys are eldritch entities who return to town once a year, heralding the arrival of summer. But who are they? What do they want? What will happen?

Blast your favourite song. Pour drinks. Spread the word: they will be here soon.

Each round, read the prompts, write down your answers, and share with the group. If answers don't match up, find a way to merge them in a way that leaves you all confused and doubting your memories.

Round 1
1. "Wild-eyed and dressed to kill." Describe the Boys. Are they human?
2. What is the last death you remember happening when the boys were here?
3. Where do they go each year? Why does summer always return with them? Does it?

Round 2
1. They're looking for you. Why? Where are you?
2. "You're cool, you're red-hot, you're steaming." What powers does this give you?
3. You slapped a Boy once. Why? What happened?

Round 3
1. The Boys are at their usual place in town. Where?
2. The Boys want to fight. Who? How does it go down?
3. What happens to the town now that the Boys are back?

# Night Monsters

 
```
You are boggarts, hobs, bogles, or similar fey creatures that skulk at the edge of society. You are shackled to the humans you hate-their pillows are comfortable, their liquor is marvelous, and their keys are delicious. You lair near what they call a "suburb," and each night you venture from what they call "Puck's Hollow Nature Park" into human houses to steal things and cause trouble. 

Take 7 d6s. Apply 1 to 4 to each of Lurk (hobs are best at being sneaky), Beguile (bogles are best at enchanting mortal minds), and Bully (boggarts can loom frightfully). Choose a Great Fear you must flee from (like running water, mirrors, or clanging windchimes) and a Great Rage you must fight (like dogs, pool toys, or mailboxes).

Roll your appropriate dice when performing a task; rolling any 5 or 6 means success. Failure increases your risk of getting spotted or adds complications. 

At sundown, each night monster picks a different Mischief (such as to break a house's mirrors, steal its whiskey, or befoul its milk). Help each other complete Mischiefs during the night, taking turns narrating to describe Obstacles (such as tall fences, curious teens, angry dogs, or automated sprinklers).

# Attrition

 
```
Attrition is a two-player game about clashing forces.
You are on the same team, working together to win.
You need 3 ten-sided dice and 4 index cards to play.

Setup:
Decide the setting and scale of the conflict, from gangs to armies.
Name each side and decide which side you are playing on.

Choose 3 advantages for your side (training, reputation etc.).
Choose 4 obstacles you must overcome (zealotry, chokepoints etc.).
Record these on two index cards.

Each player secretly records their favourite type of plan on an
index card (violent, stealthy etc.). Never reveal this.

Play:
On your turn the other player asks you: "What's the plan?"

Announce which obstacle you are attacking with what advantage. Briefly
narrate your plan.

The other player silently hands you dice:
-one by default
-another if they think it could work
-another if it matches their favourite plan type

Roll.
- On 11+, cross out the obstacle. You overcome it.
- On 10-, cross out your advantage. You lose it.
You narrate the result as the OTHER SIDE in the conflict.
Pass turn.

Endgame:
If all obstacles are gone you win, if all advantages are gone you
lose. Take turns briefly narrating the aftermath.
