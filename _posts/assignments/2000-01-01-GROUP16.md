# Hush

 
```
A paranoid, conversational game of finding community for 1 Keeper of Silence and 2-5 Strangers. 

The first thing you noticed was the quiet, a rare and heavy phenomenon that has now grown to be your everyday. But you have finally found others and desperately reach for connections, slowly realizing how everyone became so sick...

Strangers each secretly write 5 Desires in this empty world but can never give them voice. Strangers each place a D6 Community Die in front of them set to 2.

The Keeper secretly writes 8 Poisoned Words and begins a 5-minute timer.

Strangers speak of their world, their silence, and ask questions of other Strangers. If any Stranger utters a Poisoned Word, the Keeper will soon give them a token. When the timer runs out, the Keeper writes 2 new Poisoned Words and restarts the timer. When a Stranger states or fulfills another's Desire, it is announced, and the fulfilling Stranger increases their Community Die by 1 and gives 1 token back to the Keeper. That Desire is crossed out.

If all Strangers' Community Dice are set to 6 they have found a new community, home. If any Stranger gets 8 tokens, they perish.

# Reciprocation

Reciprocation

Rule number 1: During this game, you may not say in character anything that you believe to be true about a player out of character.

The richest player will plunge their arm into a bag of rice. They will draw out a fistful and move across the room to place it in their bowl. The other players will catch fallen grains in their own bowls. For every grain they catch they must thank their benefactor. They must earnestly flatter them for every grain, one by one. They must describe their fictional life and their great deeds. Praise the following:

Ruthlessness
Opulence
Fairness
Intelligence
Physical appearance
Devotion to a deity
Virility
Skill in a profession
Honesty
Humility

After drawing rice, choose the next player to draw a smaller fist of rice. If they take too much, prevent them. Repeat this until everyone has drawn rice. Weigh your bowls. The player with the lightest bowl has been lying. They must retract their praise and speak the truth instead, whilst continuing to respect rule number 1. For every insult they may take rice for themselves, and continue until their bowl is the heaviest. When this is done, prepare a meal together.

# Lighthouse

 
```

Describe your isolation. Where are you? What forces you to stay? Why do you desire to leave? What do you think will happen if you fail to maintain the lighthouse? What forces you to explore?

Get into your character. Make choices based on what you know, flesh it out through play. If your chosen action isn't easily achievable, role a six sided die. Do this often.

Have you rolled this number before? No, write down the number, next to that write a vague word a twist on the results of your action. Each player will wind up with their own unique pool of twists.

Have you rolled this number before? Yes, use the twist already written.

How does the twist affect the results of your action? Resolve as you see fit, perhaps with a cost.

Your sixth twist will always be lighthouse.

You encounter a force in your work or exploration. The force is other and has its own desires. When the force acts upon its desires resolve things as before with the dice using the same pool of twists as the player the force is interacting with.

What actually happens when the lighthouse goes out?

What happens to you?

# Wax Nostalgic

 
```
The Wax Museum, your forever home, is aflame. You, resident ghosts, watch as the only bodies you've known for ages melt into flesh-colored puddles. This is your last night to possess your favorites; choose wisely!

Light a two-sided candle or tealight in the middle of the table; when it goes out the game ends.
Turn off the lights.
Each ghost chooses a famous or historical person; that's the mannequin you possess first.
Each ghost, light your own tea candle.
Pick a discussion topic such as "What's the secret of a fulfilled life?"
Each ghost role-plays with the others; speaking in the wax mannequin's character. If you break character, the ghost to your right gets one puff to blow out your candle. 
If your candle is blown out, your mannequin has melted, and you must choose a new mannequin to possess. You can immediately try to strike one match to relight your candle. If you fail in striking the match or lighting your candle, you must wait to try again when the next ghost fails to stay in character. 
When the center candle burns out the game is over. Any ghost with an unlit tea candle has perished forever!

# Ye gods!

 
```
You're a pantheon of capricious, bored gods who amuse yourselves by meddling in one mortal's day.

Each player-god is able to manipulate the world remotely, but mortals retain their autonomy.

Roll for each player's god-type: god of... (d6)
1 - Justice
2 - Love
3 - War
4 - Trickery
5 - Vengeance
6 - Snakes

Each player starts with 3 god points (gp).

Name the target NPC mortal, e.g. Chad. Play through a mundane event in Chad's life, e.g. morning routine, going on a date, doing photocopying. 

The GM narrates this event action by action. A player can spend 1gp to INTERCEDE and become active player. They narrate how they HELP or HINDER Chad at that moment, in keeping with their god-type. Active player then regains 1gp and rolls d6; other players can spend 1gp to modify this intercession by +1 or -1, explaining how they assist/impede the active god. 

4+: Chad succeeds
<4: Chad fails

Then the GM resumes narration until a player intercedes again.

If Chad gets 5 successes his event ends favourably. If he gets 5 failures he non-fatally fails. 

Players aim to manipulate Chad's life to get a conclusion that aligns with their god-type.

# Entmoot

 
```
You are tree-folk gathering to share stories of your kin.

Entmoot requires fallen leaves. It's best on a windy day surrounded by trees, friends, and little else.

Pick a leaf. Damaged gnarled shredded desiccated is best.

It's a record of your family. Find a rib with defects. Your kin's story.

Look up at the tree. Your kin. Its movement. Shape. Imagine how they walk. Speak. Watch. Their name.

Follow the rib. Tell your kin's story in turns.

A forking is a sapling's birth. What were they taught they began their wanderings?

A spot is conflict. Who or what did they encounter? Did they quarrel?

A hole is adventure outside the forest. What new things did they see, achieve?
(Lay your leaf over another's, positioning the adventure over their rib. What was their kin doing? How were they involved?)

At leaf's edge, tell of your kin's death.

If it's worm-eaten, they were consumed. By what? Were they resentful, or happy to provide sustenance?

If it's curled, they were felled. Were they cut, or toppled in a storm?

If it's browned, they burned. What grows from their ashes?

When you're finished, find another rib or leaf, another kin. Tell their story.
