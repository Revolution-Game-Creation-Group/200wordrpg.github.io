# We Who Once Ruled
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: vampires, violence, antagonistic player characters !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are the last remaining vampires

Materials:
Handmade masks, worn throughout play
Red and black fingerpaint

Take turns clockwise.  The condition of your mask determines your prompt.

Memory (Fresh or Partially Red)
Say:
"I once ruled..."
Describe the decadent power you once held.

The others either respond:
"But now"
Describe how that institution was lost to time, or taken by mortals for their own ends.  Relish their loss.

Or one may challenge:
"But I envied it..."
Describe how they sought to usurp this power.

The challenger and challenged smear red on their masks, revealing simultaneously.  The others point to the reddest mask: this is the winner.  If uncertain, pass to the next turn.

The loser marks their mask with black.

Rage (Completely Red)
	Say to another:
"I have come for you..."
Describe your attempt to destroy them.  They respond.
The others decide a winner and point to them.
The loser must destroy their mask.

Regret (Black Mark)
Say
"I never..."
No one responds
Smear at least enough red to cover your mark.

Twice-Dead (Destroyed)
Do not speak words or take turns (still point).
Walk around, clutching your broken mask, hissing or laughing at those remaining.

End when one remains

# Blood on Ministry's Carpets

 
```
3+ players
A D10 dice

One player gets to be a GM, others are 'janitors'

You work in the very heart of a totalitarian State - The Ministry. The Ubergeneral is going to visit soon but for some reason there's blood on the carpet near the conference room! And the worst of all - you've lost your keycard that allowed you to get into the technical zone, where the closet with all your stuff is situated.
 Players try to get the cleaning chemicals by all possible means - tricking the officer into believing they are high-ranked officials, crawling through the vents or just stealing keycards from others. GM sets the difficulty on 1-10 scale and janitors roll dice trying to get over the number. When players fail they are noticed by officers and can blame other players for their faults. If they don't succeed at convincing GM or if other player successfully blames them they get a 'warning'. After three warnings player is taken by the secret police. The janitor that actually cleans the blood stain is declared a 'National Hero'. 
When all the players are out or the carpet is clean, GM narrates Ubergeneral's visit and each janitor's fate.

# Agile Ribbit-ribbit, my Creators salute you!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Depending on all players' choices game might include ANY kind of animals trying to TEAR YOU APART.

```
A party game of incorrect assumptions for minimum four players.

Players are amorphous technoblobs, tasked by their CREATORS with contacting Earthlings, bound by:

Biased instructions - to "Copy NATIVES' form and behavior to facilitate the contact". CREATORS are uniform and they evolved on perfectly monotypic planet. Concepts like "lesser species", "diversity's consequences" are meaningless to them.
 
Matter - Ants? Elephants? Whatever you resemble, you weigh 1 lb with size to scale.

Everyone puts same number (3 + planned number of rounds) of unrevealed animal names (no microorganisms) into the drawing bag. 

Everyone draws from the bag to meet their first NATIVE. They depart before you finish morphing, but you are ready... for some rushed ASSUMPTIONS. 

Everyone, in turns:
====
Share your assumptions on how your CURRENT form signifies SAPIENCE.
Search for another NATIVE: draw from the bag.
Strive to achieve communication, against remaining players collectively roleplaying the NATIVE, reaching "consensus" by: first come, first served, unless second is funnier! 
Reassemble yourself if required, accept and analyze your failure aloud, morph into the NATIVE just met.
====
After a full round, each player distributes four points among two opponents, awarding most entertaining attempts.
Start next round, or:

Tally the scorecard and declare the winner.

# What is the deal with radioactive cannibals?

 
```
The world has ended, and only the people in your hotel survived.  The building is secure and supplies are plentiful. 

All of you were attendees at a Stand Up Comedy Convention. With nothing left to do, you perform routines.  Forever.

During each game (or Show), players take it in turns to perform Sets of an agreed length (one minute is ideal). Each player has three Sets per Show.  

A player's sets should each cover one of the following topics: the player's backstory, the nature of the apocalypse, and the world that remains. (Like all stand-up comedy, actual laughs are ideal, but in no way required).

During the game, players must use the following phrases at least once each:

"Who else remembers..."
"Don't you just hate it when..."
"What is the deal with..."

After each player has performed three Sets, the group should vote on the winner.  Consideration should primarily be given to players who crafted a cohesive character, setting and narrative.  Lesser consideration should be given to whether the comedians were actually funny.

# A Mutiny Most Foul

 
```
The Captain is dead, and one of you will be forever branded.

Write the following numbers and motives on index cards, and deal one to each player: 1-love, 2-duty, 3-cowardice, 4-greed, 5-cruelty, 6-hunger. These may be attributed to either your character or the captain; either way, it has created an intolerable situation. Repeat with the following: 1-hate, 2-treachery, 3-bravery, 4-fear, 5-justice, 6-compassion. These represent a trait of your character. Together, these reveal who your character is, and why they were willing to mutiny. If both numbers are the same, however, you must secretly remain loyal to your captain!

Players now take turns describing the situation that led to the mutiny. Reveal a card to determine who narrates first; a player with a 1 on either card goes first, followed by any 2, etc. No player may narrate a second scene until everyone has taken a turn. Once each player has taken a turn describing the situation, repeat with your other card to describe how the mutiny occurred.

If there is conflict, the numbers will determine the number of sailors who will fight with you. The higher total wins.

# Theatrical Release

 
```
You are collaborating to make a movie. Decide what kind. However, each player has their own agenda for it. Roll 2d6 to determine what that is, re-rolling duplicates.

2- You already had this giant mechanical contraption made, so...
3- This product placement WILL happen
4- Promised role to bumbling cousin
5- Ensure staff are treated well
6- Stay within budget
7- Win a major award
8- Tell a compelling story
9- Showcase technical aspects
10- Cats are cute
11- Piss off your dad(s)
12- Characters can only speak at most 200 words
          
Each player has 3 dice. Choose a player to start with Creative Control. They describe the movie: the setting, themes, cast, plot and scenes. At any time, someone may interrupt and give a die to attempt to take Creative Control. They both roll. High roll gets Creative Control and continues describing the movie. Low roll introduces a minor complication.

Players without dice may get one from another by agreeing to a stipulation.

Player with Creative Control may ask anotherr for help to lock in an aspect of the movie. Both players lose a die each.

Once all dice are lost, the movie is released as is.

# The Truth about Jevallik: A Game for Two

 
```
Servant's Rules

You're a recent convert to Jevallik's Servants.

Love motivates you to share the truth door-to-door despite the controversies. You had a scary experience at the last door. What happened?

Knock to begin. Introduce yourself, your mission, and the peace of Jevallik.

Whenever they make an objection, the objection is partly true. Choose one to begin your response, each exactly once:

-Well, what the scriptures say is:
-That bothered me at first. Think of it this way:
-The media has exaggerated this a bit. Here's the truth:
-Jevallik's servants are imperfect too, but here's what I think:
-I don't believe that, but here's what I do believe:

Convince them to hear more about the Truth.


-----

The Unconverted's Rules

You're at home when a crazy Jevallik's Servant knocks on the door. What were you doing? 

Something about them makes you think you can help them start to break free.

After they introduce themselves, make an objection and let the Servant answer. Make five objections, either about:

-Something controversial their organization did 
-A bizarre belief you heard about

Whatever you say is true, but listen politely to the Servant's answer. Be gentle.

Convince the Servant to share their doubts.
