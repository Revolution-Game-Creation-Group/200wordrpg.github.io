# We Who Once Ruled
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: vampires, violence, antagonistic player characters !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are the last remaining vampires

Materials:
Handmade masks, worn throughout play
Red and black fingerpaint

Take turns clockwise.  The condition of your mask determines your prompt.

Memory (Fresh or Partially Red)
Say:
"I once ruled..."
Describe the decadent power you once held.

The others either respond:
"But now"
Describe how that institution was lost to time, or taken by mortals for their own ends.  Relish their loss.

Or one may challenge:
"But I envied it..."
Describe how they sought to usurp this power.

The challenger and challenged smear red on their masks, revealing simultaneously.  The others point to the reddest mask: this is the winner.  If uncertain, pass to the next turn.

The loser marks their mask with black.

Rage (Completely Red)
	Say to another:
"I have come for you..."
Describe your attempt to destroy them.  They respond.
The others decide a winner and point to them.
The loser must destroy their mask.

Regret (Black Mark)
Say
"I never..."
No one responds
Smear at least enough red to cover your mark.

Twice-Dead (Destroyed)
Do not speak words or take turns (still point).
Walk around, clutching your broken mask, hissing or laughing at those remaining.

End when one remains

# Untitled goose rpg

 
```
As a group, pick a GM (Goose Master) and pick the setting of your untitled goose rpg.
Example settings: village, castle, space station, military base.

The GM should come up with some locations, some humans to antagonise, and some items for the geese to steal. At worst, let the geese decide. They must bring this loot back to their goose hideout.

Players, roll a horrible goose by first choosing an identifying item.
Example items: eyepatch, flat cap, red ribbon, sunglasses, bandana.

Then assign 0-3 once each to the following stats: RUN, DUCK, HONK, PECK.
Your FLAP stat is 2.

When you do a thing, roll d6 against the appropriate stat.
You succeed if the result is equal to or less than this number.

RUN: Move quickly, feats of agility
DUCK: Move stealthily
HONK: Persuade, intimidate, deceive
PECK: Pick up something, enter combat

FLAP: Attempt to fly.
A goose can add their FLAP to any other stat, provided that player is flapping their arms.
Someone else may have to roll their d6 for them.

If a goose does something particularly horrible, the GM can award them a Horrible Point, which can be exchanged for an instant success on any action.

# Stories from the Toybox

 
```
You are children's toys acting out a child's fantasies.

Needed: 
    1 Magic 8-Ball
    3-5 people
    one d6 (optional)

As a table choose a Setting.
Each player chooses a Toy and a Role.

You may create your own Setting, Toys, and Roles, or roll below.

One player must play as the Villain and proclaims their evil goals to start the game. 

Players take turns framing Scenes that involve 1+ toys and a defined conflict. Once the Scene reaches a climax, ask the Magic 8-Ball a yes/no question about the conflict (e.g. does the cowboy catch the rustlers?). React to the answer appropriately. It is acceptable to end on a cliffhanger.

A Story has 3 Acts, and an Act consists of each player framing one Scene. The villain's scene goes last. Act 1 establishes conflict. Act 2 escalates danger. Act 3 resolves the story.

Settings

1 - Cowboys
2 - Astronauts
3 - Knights & Wizards
4 - Dinosaurs
5 - Pirates
6 - Cops & Robbers

Toys
 
1 - Stuffed animal
2 - Puppet
3 - Action figure
4 - Doll
5 - Vehicle
6 - Etch-a-sketch
 
Roles
 
1 - Hero
2 - Love interest
3 - Sidekick
4 - Authority figure
5 - Voice of reason
6 - Villain

# Two Hearts with One Face
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: doppelgangers, memory loss/recovery, possible gaslighting !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Take a deck, shuffle it, place it between you two. Gather tokens to represent your memories, your right to live.

One of you is a doppelganger. One of you is real. You can't remember who is who. Why?

Create three things: 
+ the identity you fight for
+ who you love most
+ what happens if the doppelganger is undiscovered

Spread the cards, draw one. Share a memory of:

CLUBS: Passion, mistakes well made.
SPADES: Violence, lies well received.
HEARTS: Love, corrupted and sincere.
DIAMONDS: Treasure, intangible and deadly.

The other responds. Draw one.

CLUBS: No! What actually happened was... (Gain 2 tokens)
SPADES: No. Maybe. From a certain point of view... (Gain 1 token)
HEARTS: Yes, but! You forgot something essential...(Lose 1 token)
DIAMONDS: Yes, and as a consequence...(Lose 2 tokens).

Draw cards until someone: 
+ Reaches 6 tokens
+ Despairs and gives up
+ Falls in love with someone else

When the doppelganger is revealed, draw two cards each. Reveal from your heart: 

CLUBS: Your selfish desire
SPADES: Your haunting truth
HEARTS: Your true intentions
DIAMONDS: Your hidden weapon

What happens next? Be gracious, be kind. Forgive, and let go. Forget, if you like.

Or kill, and be done with it.

# When the world ends

 
```
You are a group of three to four researchers at a remote location (describe) to save the world. Discuss the nature of the issue to be solved. Each researcher secretly choses one of the following words:

FAME
PRESSURE
SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS
BOASTING
SOCIAL CONTACTS
RELATIONSHIP

This is the real reason you're here. Flesh out your character.

The game is divided in four scenes, in which players take turns as the lead researcher. During each scene: roll a six-sided die, consult the table below and narrate how your characters proposes a solution. Let other players react in character.

1-2: A quick fix, which doesn't solve anything.
3-4: An expensive fix which has no support.
4-6: A good fix which introduces a bigger issue.
7: A great fix which will ensure public outrage.
8: The perfect fix at the expense of half of the world population.

A player may opt to show her/his real objective to add 2 to the die roll. Narrate how the personal issue affects the solution.
Play ends with a vote (own solution is excepted). When you showed your objective, your vote doubles. Ties mean no solution is approved. Narrate together how the world ends.

# Double, double toil and trouble.
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Witches !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
This is a world building game where the players follow the flow of history as told through questions.
The players take on the role of witches scrying over a single world.
Play requires a magic-8 ball which when used provides random "yes" or "no" style answers with varying levels of confidence.
If the group has a preferred random answer generator, such as an oracle, they may use that instead.

To setup: Each Witch describes who they are, and states a detail about the world in which they all live. This creates a starting point for asking questions about said world.

Each Witch takes it in turn to scry by:
1) Asking a question that could be answered with either "yes" or "no".
2) Obtaining and recording an answer from the magic-8 ball. If the question relates to the answer from the prior question the group may decide to veto up to one nonsensical answer. The scrying witch must agree.
3) Pass play to the next Witch.

Sometimes apparent contradictions may occur. Lean into them. How they get resolved will reveal much about the world being explored.

As with life, these stories may have no end. Play until no longer fun.
