# Alone
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Solitude !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Alone is an immersive, narrative game for either one (solo), or two+ people.

You wake up and everyone is gone. Even the internet, which still exists, seems devoid of people.

You need:
A diary: notebook and pen, digital notepad, or recording app
30+ minutes every day for a week
A private space
Optional: headphones

Spend at least thirty minutes each day without any human company. If your environment is usually filled with human sounds, use headphones and play white noise. Please be aware of your limits and end the game if it affects you too much.

Contemplate these things while you sit in silence for 15-20 minutes. Then take 10-15 minutes to chronicle (write, speak, or draw) about it in your diary.
Day 1: The first person you noticed missing
Day 2: The first house (other than your own) you checked
Day 3: The first social media platform you checked
Day 4: The first public building you checked
Day 5: Who you miss the most
Day 6: How you fill your days now 
Day 7: You found another person! Exchange diaries (you can do this online). If a solo game: Describe finding signs of another person

# Snake Eyes
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: pft no !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A snake is you.
Each snake has three traits: Blue, Green, and UV, among which they must distribute twelve six-sided dice (minimum two in each and maximum six in any given one).
Blue dice are used for logic and resilience.
Green dice are used for persuasion and agility.
UV dice are used for intuition and force.
When no particular trait is called for, roll Snek, which is equal to your lowest trait +1 die.

When you act and the outcome is in doubt, the Snake Handler will tell you what the TN is for each trait in order to succeed. You must roll at least this many trait die with a value of 3 or less to succeed, unless you roll snake eyes (two or more occurrences of 1, which is an auto-success) Sometimes a particular trait can't be used to succeed on a challenge. TNs follow.
TN	Relative Difficulty
0	Why roll?
1	Easy
2	Moderate
3	Difficult
4	Brow-Furrowing
5	Britches-Chapping
6	Teeth-Breaking
When you are injured or otherwise halted, take 1 die away from the trait you just attempted the roll with. Once you cannot roll a trait due to having no dice in it, you lose.

# Bullshit, LLC
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Imposter Syndrome, Unemployment !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Your resume is so padded you could wear it to keep the chill off. The problem? You've been tapped for The Big Project. Your goal? Don't get found out as a complete fraud.

Each player describes their character. State their name and job title. Any non-executive occupation is allowed. The GM describes the company, however much they choose.

Players need five bullshit tokens (cards, coins, beer koozies, etc) apiece.

When challenged by the GM, players roll 1d6. If they roll under their number of bullshit tokens, they succeed. If not, lose one bullshit token.

Players may corroborate their bullshit: roll 1d6 per corroborating player against their total number of bullshit tokens. Rolling under is a success.

Players may also call bullshit on other players. Roll 1d6. If the roll is higher than the other player's number of bullshit tokens, the other player is called out and loses a bullshit token.

Once per game, a player may double down on their bullshit - roll twice and take the higher number.

Rolls that tie count as successes.

If a player loses all bullshit tokens, they're fired. They can relax. Unwind. Update their resume.

# Zombie Mall
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Zombies  !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
3-8 Players are trapped in a mall defending zombie attacks.

Start the game with 2 store catalogs and 1D8 for each player. Each catalog represents a store in the mall.

DAY: players can take 8 actions:

Move: to an uninhabited store

Shop: choose products in their store, cut them out from the catalog. Players can hold 5 products.
Trade: choose a player and agree to trade any products you are holding.

Eat: Remove an edible product from inventory

Barricade: remove a product from inventory, explain how it will help your defence. Players rate your product 0-3.
Record the average rounded down as the products defense rating.

NIGHT: players add up the defense ratings and $ value of all products in their barricades. Minus 1 defense rating for each eat action below 3 taken during the day.

Players, in order of the cheapest to the most expensive barricade roll a D8 and choose a player to attack. Roll result is number of Zombies attacking. If number of Zombies exceeds defense rating player is killed.

# Persist - A 200 Word RPG

 
```
This game is best used with the X Card. Players are free to leave at any time.

Players sit around a table with pens and paper, and smile. On a sheet of paper, write your character's name, a description, their current state, five truths they hold about themselves, and five talents they have.  

Introduce your character to the group. Try to do this in character. Keep smiling.

Players should decide now what is off limits, if anything. Don't put things off limits if possible.

Situations will happen to the characters, progressing along the following scale:

A problem
A crisis
A disaster
A calamity

For each event, pass your character sheet to the left (clockwise) to a person who hasn't yet written on your sheet, if possible.

Have the player write down what happens to your character and cross out a talent, before passing the sheet back. 

Write down how your character responds to the event, using at least one of the remaining talents written on your sheet. Cross out a truth the character holds about themselves before passing the sheet. Keep smiling.

After the last phase, tell each other what happened to you, and what you lost. Keep smiling.

# Menu Quest

 
```
You're in a restaurant, with a menu and dice in front of you. Time for adventure!

One player is the gamemaster; the others create characters based on menu items.

~Setting~

Collectively choose a setting for your quest, inspired by the venue itself. Horror story with evil clowns? Wild animal encounters in the Outback? Fantasy adventure in the faerie cupcake kingdom?

~Character Creation~

Players: Choose a menu item to represent your character. Your action die is the one closest in value to (but not lower than) your item's price in dollars. (For items higher than $20, add the digits.) A lower die succeeds more often, but a higher die has a greater effect.

Use your menu item to also give your character a name and description.

Example: Reuben is Swiss with a rye sense of humor and a d10 action die.

~Adversaries~

GM: Choose some adversaries, each based on a menu item, with the price as their strength.

Now the group describes their journey, with the GM presenting adversaries. Each player attempts to defeat the adversary with their action die; an action is successful only if the highest number on the die comes up, reducing the adversary's strength by that number.
