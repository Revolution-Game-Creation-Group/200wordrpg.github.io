# Top Hats

 
```
These aliens look like hats and control the humans wearing them. They want to take over. The players are under their control.

You'll need some variety of hats (one per player), index cards, pins, pens.
Give each player 4 cards. On two, they write personality traits (like impulsive, cautious, joyous, grumpy, awkward). On the other two, write skills (like acrobatics, pediatrics, romance novelist, rocket science).

Shuffle personality traits and pin two to each hat. Shuffle skills and pin two to each player. Each player puts on a random hat. The hats invaded and took over a group of humans.

Players exhibit their hat's personality traits. Some hats have accents or mannerisms. These traits follow the hats (the hats are the characters). A player (and the hat controlling them) always has access to their skills.

Negotiate the best combination of personalities and skills for global domination. Argue. Plot. Plan. Trade hats. Try various combinations.

Human subjects experience confusion for a few seconds after a hat is removed. Negotiations end immediately if one of the subjects escapes or all hats agree to their current assignment.

How does each hat contribute to the invasion? How successful was the invasion as a whole?

# Little Green Men Scouting

 
```
You are a squad of Aliens sent to Scout Earth during the 1950's.

You have Advanced Camouflage Devices, but don't know the precise settings to use.

You are to observe Normal Human Activities.

When you Observe Humans, roll d6. On a 6, you understand the situation, anything else, and you miss Significant Context and must keep observing. Your interpretation of the situation should be colored by the missing context.

Each time you observe, roll d6. On a 6, the Camouflage works, anything else, and a human starts suspecting you.

You're not authorized to hurt humans, but lying, running away, and Memory Rays are all options. To undertake something risky, roll d6. On a 4+, you succeed, anything else, and the situation gets more complicated.

Once you have successfully Observed, you may move on and find another Activity.

When you must Beam Yourself Up, make a Report. Roll a d6 and add the number of successful Observations. On a 6+, your commander is pleased. On a failure, you're sent to the cloning vats to be recycled!

Beware of: Communists, Police, Rednecks, and the Men in Black.
Use: Advanced Alien tech, Cloning Chambers, Memory Rays, Tractor Beams.

   - ESCORT the LUREWITCH

 When you TAKE A RISK or USE MAGIC, roll 1d6. 
   + add 1d6 if your background prepared you for this. 
   + add 1d6 if the action aligns with your dragon's trait. 
   + add 1d6 if you have help. 
 You succeed without cost if the highest die= 5, 6.  
 Else, something goes wrong.  The GM tells you what. 

 When you HARM NATURE, keep tally.  At III, your dragon's spirit returns to the earth.

 When you BECOME HURT, the GM may write something on your sheet.
 This stays unless someone takes action to remove it.

We are (3-7) poker players but the game is only an excuse, everybody knows, maybe you even don't know how to play.

Poker deck: remove the aces, mix them, put them in the middle of the table.

Role: each player draws a secret card.
Diamonds: you are a cheater, find your piggy bank.
Hearts: you are you. stay at the game.
Spades: undercover FBI agent. Find the culprit.
Club: you are a psychopath; find the prey.

Shuffle the remaining cards, deal 5 to each player.

Game:
Each chooses 1 secret card and simultaneously reveals it, the highest wins, the owner asks a question to another player.
Those questioned must tell the truth, but with circumspection, everyone listens.
Repeat 3 times.

End of the game, the bravest reveals the first covered ace:
Diamonds: cheaters tell how they have squeezed their one out.
Hearts: wake up! Your work awaits you, choose it from the other roles. Why did you choose it?
Spades: the agents arrest. What crimes have been committed?
Club: psychopaths kill. Why precisely those prey?

# Hey, this song reminds me of you

 
```
A two-player experience about listening to music together.

to set up, each player shares one song to the other, then they narrate who their character is based on your songs. both songs are added to a new playlist.

to start, player-A shares a song to player-B and says "hey this song reminds me of you"

player-B then leads a scene inspired by the song.

a scene needs to be about a time the two characters listened to this song together, sharing some kind of vulnerability like listening to something in a car or listening on a call late at night or in a crowded room with shared earbuds. have your characters converse and interact.

at the end of every scene, both players vote at the same time to add the song to the playlist

if both say no: it does not get added.
if there's a disagreement: naysayer removes a song.
if both say yes: add the song.

now player-B shares a song to player-A and player-A leads a scene. scenes can take place hours, days, or even years after the previous scene.

if you feel as though their story is told, give the playlist a name.
