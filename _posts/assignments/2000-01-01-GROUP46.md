# Responsibilities
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Alzheimer, neglect, strong feelings. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
As many players as you want.
Someone you love has Alzheimer. You players must take care of they for 8 weeks.

Every week the loved one makes something that stress you. That must be up to you and how much you want to get into it.
Each player rolls a D6 signifying how much stress each of you gain. 
After that you get one chance to reduce the stress in one of two ways:

-Working with the loved one. Taking care of them and later confronting you feelings.
Roll a D4. Reduce the stress by that level.

- Get angry or sad. Ignore the problem and let someone else deal with it. 
Roll a D12. Reduce the stress by that number and add half of it as Guilt. Round down.

After 8 weeks you count the stress and the guilt together and see who has more negative points.

# Trashbots

 
```
Crudely built, simplistically programmed, and expendable, only Trashbots leave the detritus-encircled Fortress, braving ruins, mutants, and corrupted bots in search of meaning and treasures among trash.
 
Players: One GM, others are Trashbots.

Dice sizes (least to greatest) are:
Destroyed, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, NaN.
 
Trashbot ATTRIBUTES are: Power, Finesse, Logic. Assign to them a d10, d8, and d6 in any order. Select two monosyllabic actions for your PURPOSE. Start with 0 FULFILLMENT.

GM: describes situation.
Trashbots: describe actions. 

For uncertain outcomes, roll the relevant ATTRIBUTE die against the GM's die (d4 to d12, depending on difficulty, d6 being average). With relevant PURPOSE, roll ATTRIBUTE and a PURPOSE d6, then choose one.

Rolling higher succeeds.
 
Rolling lower fails and DEGRADES rolled ATTRIBUTE one size.
 
When tied, succeed but DEGRADE rolled ATTRIBUTE.
 
Success achieved via the PURPOSE d6 earns FULFILLMENT. Failing despite rolling PURPOSE loses FULFILLMENT.

Exception: Upon rolling the maximum value on an ATTRIBUTE die, Trashbot must ignore all other results. Succeed and UPGRADE the ATTRIBUTE one size. Describe your unwieldy improvement.  
 
If any ATTRIBUTE is Destroyed/NaN, Trashbot dies/becomes corrupted.
 
Upon completing mission: with at least 2 FULFILLMENT, rest fulfilled among the trash. Else, wander aimlessly until corrupted.

# Tickets to Nowhere

 
```
Get a slip of paper.
Get someone to stamp it.
If it's stamped, you get to play the game.

Use the stamp to imagine this slip of paper is a ticket to somewhere.

Imagine this somewhere.
Draw this somewhere on the slip.
Write on the back of the drawing all of the promise of that somewhere.
Three good things.

Hand the ticket to someone you trust, but don't let go.
As they hold the ticket, describe in frantic detail the somewhere you want to go.
Ask them if they'd like to go too.

If they don't, that's fine.
Go about your business.

If they do, then they'll need a ticket too.
Have them get a slip of paper, draw on it, write good things, and again find a third party to stamp it.

[Repeat the above with other trusted friends until you have a group of the right size.]

Get some tape.
With your group and stamped tickets, go to a bus shelter and tape them on the glass there.
Say aloud as a group:
"This isn't where we're going, but they cannot take our tickets away either."

Give each other high-fives and go get some drinks.

# Dreams of the Old Worm

 
```
You (four): Dreamshapers (sorcerers)
You (one): Rang, the Old Worm (senator)
You (all) need: marker, whiteboard, playing cards (54)
Rang has bad policies but believes in the people's will. He is dreaming (and therefore connected to other dreamers). Dreamshapers will change his dreams.
First turn (Rang): Describe your dream in three sentences. Write the sentences out. Place a card on the table for each significant detail (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, conjunction, preposition) given. Rang plays face-down cards.
First turn (Dreamshapers): Draw three cards from the deck, and flip the table's cards face-up. Every dreamshaper takes a turn placing a card on top of one of the table's cards with the same value or suit. A Joker overwrites anything. Speak of the new detail; how did the dream change?
Other turns (Rang): After all Dreamshapers go, replace a detail by replacing a table card with a face-down card from the deck. Describe what changed.
Other turns (Dreamshapers): Flip the card face-up. Take another round replacing cards and describing changes.
Play continues between Rang and Dreamshapers until Dreamshapers are out of cards. Rang takes the last turn. He wakes up and tells his chamberlain his dream. What is his new plan?

# Pool Pirates

 
```
Requires: 1 body of water, 3 pool noodles in black (Pirate), blue (Navy) & yellow (Merchant)
Collectively decide on 3 locations in the water for ports and 3 players to be captains

Each captain takes a noodle and other players join a crew 
Players may leave ships at any port and then may join any ship that travels to that port

The crew of the Merchant ship gets a point by traveling from one port to another
The crew of the Pirate ship gets a point for battling merchants
The crew of the Navy ship gets two points for winning battles against pirates


Battle
If ships meet at sea the captains will declare why they are the best captain and all players in each ship pick a side.  The captain with the most players on their side gets 3 points.  


Mutiny
If the crew mutinies the captain must swim to a port and a new captain is elected.  If more than half of a crew agrees they can mutiny


End
The game ends when it feels right.  Players with 20+ points win, players with < 20 points wasted their life.

# ACORN
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: N/A !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Setting: as desired.
Deck of cards needed for each player.
Select any 15 cards between 1 (Ace) and 5. The sum of the selected cards should not exceed 10. Add one Joker, one King and one Jack. 
Heart: Charisma
Club: Strength
Spade: Agility
Diamond: Intelligence
Shuffle your cards. When making a skill check, the GM determines the difficulty between 1 and 5 (1 = easy; 5 = difficult), draw the top card, and keep drawing until you draw the appropriate suit. If you drew => the difficulty, you succeed; otherwise, you fail. Keep the cards you drew in a discard pile.
If you run out of cards while drawing, reshuffle discards, take the top card, face down, and set it aside in a "dead" pile, then continue. 
Kings are an automatic success; Jokers are an automatic failure. 
Jacks mean something interesting happens, good or bad (determined by GM).
Suits do not matter for Jacks and Kings.
Health is your deck: if you are hit, take the top undrawn card and set it aside, face down, in the "dead" pile.
If you heal/rest, take one random "dead" card and reshuffle into your deck. You may never look at cards in the dead pile.

SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR THE FROZEN TOWER-CITY OED
===============================================

The GUIDE will lead you.

When you RISK something, establish CONSEQUENCES together.
   ACCEPT, AVOID, or SUGGEST A COMPROMISE for each or FAIL.

AVOID CONSEQUENCES by ROLLING your D20 bellow your STAMINA.

CONSEQUENCES may be missed OPPORTUNITIES 
   or have no COMPROMISE.

Circumstances may impose or grant REROLLS 
   and/or CONSEQUENCES.

Subtract HARM from STAMINA,
   then AVOID getting KOed. 

Spend LUCK to negate HARM.

SAFE RESTS recover STAMINA.

BREAKS refill LUCK. 

Discuss, continue.
