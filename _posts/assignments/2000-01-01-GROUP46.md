# Responsibilities
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Alzheimer, neglect, strong feelings. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
As many players as you want.
Someone you love has Alzheimer. You players must take care of they for 8 weeks.

Every week the loved one makes something that stress you. That must be up to you and how much you want to get into it.
Each player rolls a D6 signifying how much stress each of you gain. 
After that you get one chance to reduce the stress in one of two ways:

-Working with the loved one. Taking care of them and later confronting you feelings.
Roll a D4. Reduce the stress by that level.

- Get angry or sad. Ignore the problem and let someone else deal with it. 
Roll a D12. Reduce the stress by that number and add half of it as Guilt. Round down.

After 8 weeks you count the stress and the guilt together and see who has more negative points.

#### 3+ players, d6(*) and coins ####

You're a...
*Neurotic...	        *Scientist...
*Thickly-Accented...	*Engineer...
*Belligerent...	       	*Pilot...
*Superstitious...	*Passenger...
*Cowardly ...   	*Linguist...
*Robot...	        *Medic...

...on a rocket-ship exploring uncharted-space.

Secretly you're...
*...terminally-ill.
*...engaged.
*...3-days from retirement.
*...expecting a baby.
*...the rocket-company owner.
*...a spy! (Improvise!)

 ---###---

Introduce your character; role-play radio-chatter. After a few minutes take-turns flipping a coin.

On the third 'tails', the rocket violently explodes because of a...
*...core-meltdown!
*...robot mutiny!
*...computer-malfunction!
*...cosmic-storm!
*...space-squid!
*...tear in space-time!

Suddenly you're all blasted into deep-space! You hear panicking-survivors on your radio. One life-pod pings on your suit-instruments...

 ---###---

Center the life-pod (biggest coin) between the players; everyone places a space-suit (coin) on their table-edge.

Take-turns flicking your space-suit across the table to reach the life-pod and avoid or kill other survivors. Role-play your radio-chatter. 

Remember there's only one seat! 

 ---###---

If your space-suit:
-falls off the table, you're lost-in-space but can still curse the others via radio!
-stops within coin-width of the life-pod you grab-on.
-stops within coin-width of another space-suit, push-away (flick again) or you...
*...burn alive from a fuel-leak! 
*...both die from the impact!
*...struggle but escape!
*...just miss each-other!
*...smash their helmet!
*...fry them with your ray-gun!

To win, be the last-survivor.

# The State Banquet for Visiting Aliens

 
```
Best played over a meal.

Alien dignitaries have been invited to a state banquet in their honour. 

Some of you are from EARTH and some of you are ALIENS. You are all VERY IMPORTANT GUESTS, so put on pompous voices and use your manners. Give yourself a title. 

Unfortunately, the Aliens have no idea what is being served at the banquet and they are very agitated and confused. This meal could cause an interplanetary incident! The Earthlings must avert disaster by describing menu items.

To begin, an Alien should point to a dish on the menu or the table and ask: "WHAT IS THIS?" Earthlings respond by describing the food, its ingredients, taste, smell or any other feature. 

However, the Aliens have no concept of Earth ANIMALS or PLANTS, and no translation for the words SWEET, SALTY, SPICY or SOUR. Whenever an animal, plant or taste sensation is mentioned an Alien should ask "WHAT IS THAT?" Earthlings should explain.

The stranger the descriptions the more appetising the Aliens find the dishes. This should be conveyed through facial expressions, gestures and sounds.

Earthlings should continue describing dishes until the Aliens are happy. With the crisis averted, everyone eats.

# We Are Sorry
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Body horror, cats !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are all a cat. You live in a house with your owner, John. Whenever you declare you'd like to do something, you perform that action unless another player disagrees. All players who are in conflict flip coins. Those who get heads control the actions of the cat. If more than one player gets heads, the cat gruesomely changes to be able to perform both actions simultaneously. The game ends when John can't leave the house.
The narrator controls the house, John, and the consequences of your actions.

You are hungry.

# The Capsule.

 
```

In which we roleplay recollections then replay other characters' differing memories!  


Setup:

Each player puts 3 mementos in a bag/time-capsule. 

Random things at-hand are great. 

We're together again. Time to exhume the capsule!  

Discuss these questions:

What brought us together then?  Now?  
Why did we bury it?  

Describe your character....  

Each player makes one notecard for each other player (completing ALL-CAPITALIZED as below).  These will guide other's roleplay by telling them how they're remembered by you. 



(REMEMBERING CHARACTERS NAME)'s  TAKE ON  (YOUR CHARACTER)

I AM:  (DESCRIPTION OF HOW YOU'RE SEEN BY THE REMEMBERER)

BECAUSE: (rememberer will describe a situation) 

YES-AND:  (ADD SOMETHING...)



Vary people's take on you. 
Connect to what's established.  

Pass out cards for "Because:" input.  

Re-collect and complete.

Redistribute so each player has a card-set describing their biases toward each other character


Play:

Take turns pulling a memento out.

Use it to frame a scene (recollecting in character). Lean into your biases. 

Rememberer hands out their cards to respective player/characters. Everyone shares information then plays accordingly!

 "Rememberer" calls scene and re-collects cards. 

Each scene elicits replays:   

Another character disagrees, describes changes (in character) and hands out their cards... 

Reenact!!!

No telling where the "truth lies";).

# Space Cowboys

 
```
Blood-thirsty Outlaws are terrorizing our peacefull Galaxy! Such reckless times require equally hot-headed heroes!

There is one Captain, who tells the story. Other players play as Cowboys - beautifully crazed bandit hunters. To create a Cowboy player should choose Badassness ("Drunken Monk", "Sexy Pilot", "Bold Grunt" or come up with their) and randomly receive Hidden Agenda ("Make love with...", "Vendetta on...", "Trick...", "Destroy..." - the target for Agenda could be a party member, Outlaw or even some special object). They also describe their Ships with one Style- "Speeder", "Stomper", "Trapper" etc.

The Captain describes an Outlaw with 3 Cunnings such as "Bug Collector", "Giant Mothership", "Smokes Poison", "etc. And of course one Edgy Plot - "Rob a Strip Planet", "Kill President of the Galaxy" etc.

Cowboys need to capture Outlaw, but each of them has to secretly fullfill their Agenda.

When Cowboy should overcome Danger, they roll 2d6. If they can use their Badassnes, they get to reroll one die. 1-4 counts as Very Bad, 5-9 as Goes Partly As Planned, 10-12 as Badass!

Outlaw is roleplayed accordingly to his Cunnings (define character and give benefits that Captain thinks are necessary) and Edgy Plot.

# Happily Ever After

 
```
Many suitors wait outside the Princess' window.
One of them is her authentic Prince Charming.
One of them is the Princess in disguise!
Game for 3 or more players. 

The goal of the Princess is to find her Prince Charming and vice-versa; Suitors aim to be chosen by the Princess.

At the start of the game, one player writes a "Princess" card, one "Prince Charming", and as many "Suitor" as necessary for the remaining players. These cards are randomly assigned to the players in order to set their secret identities.

Each player takes turns to try to impress the Princess. Each one describes an amazing feat they'd done or would do for the Princess' love. 
Example: "I'd slay every dragon in these lands!".

After each player described at least 2 feats, the Princess reveals her identity and selects a suitor. If she guesses the Prince Charming, they live happily ever after. If she does not, the Suitor then narrates a new end to the story. 
Example: "We moved to my farm to raise chickens!".

The couple formed may exchange phone numbers and become friends.

Winking is allowed throughout the game to signal other players, whichever their role or intentions are.
