# Babies Vs. Caretaker

 
```
GM: You are a caretaker, Your goal is to keep the babies safe and clean.
Players: You are a baby.  It is your goal to drive your caretaker to madness.  

Players: Call your mother, ask her on a five point scale how difficult you were as a child.  This is your energy in D6's
GM: Call your mother, ask her on a five point scale to rate your parenting skills.  Multiply this by the player count.  This is your sanity. 
 
Player: Describe a dangerous/disgusting act your baby performed, GM will determine a difficulty.  Players can combine efforts/dice.  Roll the dice pool.  4+ equals success.  Discard each 1-2.  When you are out of dice, you are sleepy and it's time for a nap.  If you roll more successes than the difficulty, GM loses sanity equivalent to difficulty fixing your mess/saving you from injury.  
GM: Set difficulty.  "Diaper blowout over expensive rug" is 1 difficulty.  Complex things like "open baby-proofed cabinet and swallow cleaning supplies" are 3.   Describe how your caretaker stops it, easily if the player rolls failure, stressfully on success.

The GM wins if all babies fall asleep.  The player win by driving the caretaker insane.

# Snake Eyes
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: pft no !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A snake is you.
Each snake has three traits: Blue, Green, and UV, among which they must distribute twelve six-sided dice (minimum two in each and maximum six in any given one).
Blue dice are used for logic and resilience.
Green dice are used for persuasion and agility.
UV dice are used for intuition and force.
When no particular trait is called for, roll Snek, which is equal to your lowest trait +1 die.

When you act and the outcome is in doubt, the Snake Handler will tell you what the TN is for each trait in order to succeed. You must roll at least this many trait die with a value of 3 or less to succeed, unless you roll snake eyes (two or more occurrences of 1, which is an auto-success) Sometimes a particular trait can't be used to succeed on a challenge. TNs follow.
TN	Relative Difficulty
0	Why roll?
1	Easy
2	Moderate
3	Difficult
4	Brow-Furrowing
5	Britches-Chapping
6	Teeth-Breaking
When you are injured or otherwise halted, take 1 die away from the trait you just attempted the roll with. Once you cannot roll a trait due to having no dice in it, you lose.

# Sailor's Sewing Day

 
```
You are a sailor at sea. Today you are mending your clothes.

Each player needs a sheet of paper towel, needle, and thread. 

For each sheet:  
Tear a line from edge to center.
Rip out a hole.
Rip off a corner.

Put all scraps together in the middle of the group. Decide the nature of your ship and why it is at sea.

Each player threads their needles. As you do, talk about who you are and how you came to be on the ship.  

A player begins sewing one rip/tear on their sheet. Randomly take a scrap from the center to mend missing pieces. 

Based on what you are mending, talk about:
Tear - An unfinished business or regret.
Hole - A special person and why they are special.
Corner - How you almost died in the ship, and how you were saved. 

Players take turns sharing stories based on the prompts until everyone has taken a turn. The round moves when all rips/tears selected in the previous round are mended. Fill time by conversing on what has been shared. 

When all rips are mended, talk about how each sailor has grown at sea and how their clothes reflect this.

# My Red Goddess
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: noir stereotypes, violence, romantic relationships !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Two players, poker deck, index cards. Everyone gets the cards between brackets.

  * Her: femme fatale (Q Hearts, A Hearts, A Diamonds);
  * Him: detective (J Spades, A Clubs, A Spades).

Describe:

  * Her: in velvet and roses;
  * Him: in smoke and grey.

She sets the scene and hires him to find something important, personal, and stolen.

In conflicts the last word is:

  * Hers: mind and heart;
  * His: body and violence.

Before every scene, she deals one red and one black card face down, then writes and hides an index card under each:

  * Red: a secret about her;
  * Black: a clue about the case.

  He taps one, she sets the scene. He plays the detective, she plays other characters. She reveals the secret or clue he tapped.

Play scenes until three secrets or three clues are revealed. She sets a scene in which they confront each other.

She gives him her Aces, he gives her his Aces. Both play one.

  * A Hearts, A Spades: she loves but kills him;
  * A Hearts, A Clubs: they love each other, but cannot stay together;
  * A Diamonds, A Spades: he gets paid, she'll never love again;
  * A Diamonds, A Clubs: he gets paid, she's framed by justice.

# Building the Rainbow Bridge
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Pet Loss !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Players are family, maybe blood relatives, maybe not. Say your name, your age, your relationship to your left-hand neighbor. Everyone puts a heads-up coin on the table.

Red
Your pet enters your lives. Everyone says a few sentences about their first day with the pet. Turn to tails when you've had your say.

Orange
The pet chooses its name. Suggest one, explain why, then turn to heads. After, everyone flips coins- heads eliminated, tails are contenders. Flip contenders until one's left. Zero tails? Do-over.

Yellow
The honeymoon's new and lovely: temperaments revealed, boundaries tested, behavior learned. Everyone flips. Share an unquestionably good (heads) or questionably good (tails) thing your pet does.

Green
is a little later. Everyone says one word in turn, making a story about the good, comfortable times. Repeat as needed.

Blue
is later yet. Everyone says one sentence, telling the story of the decline. Stack your coins together.

Indigo
is the end. Take a moment. Then, everyone tells about their last day with your pet. Take a coin when done. Your pet dies when the coins are gone. Breathe. Cry together or alone.

Violet
is a year later. How do you feel?


Once you're ready: play again.
