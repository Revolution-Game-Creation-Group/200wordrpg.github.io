# Babies Vs. Caretaker

 
```
GM: You are a caretaker, Your goal is to keep the babies safe and clean.
Players: You are a baby.  It is your goal to drive your caretaker to madness.  

Players: Call your mother, ask her on a five point scale how difficult you were as a child.  This is your energy in D6's
GM: Call your mother, ask her on a five point scale to rate your parenting skills.  Multiply this by the player count.  This is your sanity. 
 
Player: Describe a dangerous/disgusting act your baby performed, GM will determine a difficulty.  Players can combine efforts/dice.  Roll the dice pool.  4+ equals success.  Discard each 1-2.  When you are out of dice, you are sleepy and it's time for a nap.  If you roll more successes than the difficulty, GM loses sanity equivalent to difficulty fixing your mess/saving you from injury.  
GM: Set difficulty.  "Diaper blowout over expensive rug" is 1 difficulty.  Complex things like "open baby-proofed cabinet and swallow cleaning supplies" are 3.   Describe how your caretaker stops it, easily if the player rolls failure, stressfully on success.

The GM wins if all babies fall asleep.  The player win by driving the caretaker insane.

# Witches in a well

 
```
You are witches in a well, hurtling through space and time, escaping said place by creating a spell with a suitable rhyme.

Each round you arrive at a location, which, in your desperation, each witch describes with a word, until everyone's been heard.

Now each witch wagers an appropriate possession, maybe a piece of their garment as concession, to sacrifice for the spell to decamp their cell.

One starts at random, attempting a rhyme, with all of these words, in but one minute's time.

Should the witch fail, you all have to bail, and try again on the next rotation.

Describe again this new location, once more wager an oblation, then it is the next witch's vocation to attempt the spell to save you from the well.

When the locations bested equals the number of witches, however divested, the spell is complete, the hurtling rested, and the witches freed.

If personal affairs become dangerously scarce, and you run out of witchy wares, you're stuck in these nightmares, and sheer out of good luck.

```
The person running the game is The House. All other participants are Players.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players:

Roll on each row of the wealth table, then answer the following:

-What was your first big win?
-Why do you need a win so badly?
-How much will be enough?

There are three rules all Players must follow:
1) Every hand you win, state a dream for your future.
2) Every hand you lose, state something you missed or lost while playing.
3) You may not willingly leave the table while you or The House has money. If asked to leave the table, justify why you are staying.

The House:

Decide on the game to be played. Blackjack is recommended. Bet in $1,000 increments.

The House begins with $100,000,000.

After each hand, gently encourage one player to leave the table.

You may choose to end the game only once you have decided that all Players have nothing left to lose.

# Falling Down
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```

You are a middle-aged man or woman frustrated with your work and passing by a very difficult problem. And the last bad thing that happens to you will be the last straw, making you lose control.

Choose a profession, a personal problem and something that irritates you a lot.

Your rage die starts at 1. Whenever you perform an action, roll 2d6 and add the value of your rage die: 1-6 you fail; 7-9 you get success at a cost; 10-12 you get a success.

Whenever you encounter a situation that irritates you, roll 1d6. If the result is greater than the current number of your rage die, add 1 to your rage die. If it's something related to your profession, personal problem, or what irritates you a lot, add 2 to the rage die instead. When you reach 6, you lose control and commit unbridled violence.

Your police-chased die starts at 1. Whenever you do something violent, roll 1d6. If the result is greater than the current value of your police-chased die, add 1 to it. When you reach 6, the police find you and you are captured.

# The Icebox

 
```
The Time Police have arrested many criminals and war heroes from across the multiverse, and due to corruption behind the scenes, these people are forced to fight each other in Intergalactic Party World's arena, the ICEbox, in a game show called the Intergalactic Combat Environment.

Players form a team of inmates from across the multiverse, and try to survive their matches while trying to find a way off of Intergalactic Party World.

Players choose 4 skills of their choice, and assigns each a value. 
One of these skills at +3, one at +2, and two at +1. 
These are called your "Character's Skills" and can be anything from Guitar Solos to Pilot Aircraft.

Players then choose between Melee, Ranged, and Magic, and gives themselves a +2 in that skill. 

Players get any two items of their choice that are used with their skills. One item gives a +3 to a skill of your choice, and the other gives a +2 to a different skill.

Skills are performed with D6s equal to your skill rating against a difficulty set by the DM. A difficulty 10 is difficult for someone with a 2 skill, and easy for someone with a 5 skill.

```
One Beauty is on an island with 3+ Hunks. Each Hunk is trying to win the Beauty's Love by the end of the Night. But some Hunks are here for the Wrong Reasons as well...

A Producer distributes between the Hunks an equal number of secret Real and Fraud designations. 

The Beauty wants to find True Love.

Real Hunks want True Love. Fraud Hunks just want to Win.

The Producer wants to create delicious Drama and Conflict between Hunks.

Play out Dinners between the Beauty and all the Hunks, and individual Dates with the Beauty. Producers provide beverages and influence Hunks toward Conflict by asking questions and setting up scenarios.

A Hunk can call out any other Hunk once. The Hunk called out must try to prove their True Love for the Beauty. 

The Beauty should consider defenses when making their final decision. At the end of the Night, the Beauty will give their Love to the Hunk of their choosing. Producers reveal whether that Hunk was Real or a Fraud.

If the Hunk was Real, the Beauty and the Hunk win, and all other Hunks lose.

If the Hunk was a Fraud, Fraud Hunks win.

The Producer always wins.

# Times Gone By
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: References to Alcohol. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Gather a few of your oldest friends to remember the Good ol' Days when life was hard but times were good.

Begin by pouring each other a round of drinks. The oldest then welcomes you all, takes a hearty swig of their drink, and regales you with their favorite story of your times together.

If someone thinks the teller forgot something or missed something important, they take a hearty swig and remind them of what they missed. Such occasions are met with grumbles and the drinking of drinks or apologies and the nodding of heads. Mistakes are fixed and missing details are worked into the tale.

If someone thinks the teller got something wrong, they take a hefty gulp of drink and explain how it *really* happened. Such occasions are met with raucous chatter as the drinker now tells the story.

Anyone finishing their drink gets the final say. Drink-less drinkers may still assert afterwards, albeit unreliably or unconvincingly.

The tale isn't worth ending if the table runs out of drink. Pour another round, tell a different tale. 

If a tale reaches its end, raise your glasses and toast to the Good ol' Days. Down your drinks and pour another.
