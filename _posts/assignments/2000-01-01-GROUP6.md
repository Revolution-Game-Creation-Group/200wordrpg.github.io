# Heroes of the 80's

 
```
The player characters are actionheroes from the 80's.

One person is the director and controls the villains, describe the scenes and outcome.

Phases of the game:

1. Going clockwise the players in order choose 1 thing from the list below and elaborate it. The first players choice is the actual threat that must be defeated at the end. The other choices are obstacles or scenes leading to the end. 

Terrorists with nukes
Giant laser
The President is hostage
Evil Robots
Lasersharks
Gene-manipulated Monkeys
The Girl with the silver dagger
Orbital array
Predator
Dread Gazebo
Submarine


2. The players describe their hero to the other players. Stereotypes are superOK!

3. The director describes the scenes and the players describes the actions of their heroes. Remember that the actual threat is the last scene. 

Each hero starts the game with 2 heropoints.  When performing an action the hero succeed if he uses a heropoint. If he chooses to fail, he instead gain a heropoint. The heroes cannot die unless they sacrifice themselves for the others. Then all other heroes gain a heropoint.  

To defeat the final threat each remaining hero must be able to spend 2 heropoints. Otherwise evil prevails.

# ARKANA
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: non-occult usage of tarot cards !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Players are sprites tasked to shape a young world.
Players and DM take tarot sets and split them into major and minor arcana and shuffle.

Stats:
distribute: 1,2,3,3
*create&shape-wands
*destroy&reduce-swords
* communicate&influence-coins
*life&resistance-cups

checks 
Choose apropriate skill and draw cards accordingly from lower arkana and add values together,
if card-suit matches skill, value doubles 
if sum matches value on major arkana card from DM=success
if exactly 2 show the same suit=crit
if other player supports, add half  of other player's card suit-value rounded down.
If DM performs check, either use card suit-value or draw a storyline-appropriate amount of cards.
If player loses, a different approach must be used.


GM uses major arkana-cards to tell the story, one at a time. If a player resolves a card(=situation) with a critical skill check, GM awards said card to player.
GM can add additional cards to introduce adversaries and complications.

Players can use card amount equal to skill rating to raise skill, or can use card to SWAY story, by using card as inspiration to change course of story, but player can only add to GM's story.

Keep going until deck is empty or the story is told.

# EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE

 
```
You can't save everyone, you must try nonetheless. With great responsibility comes moderate power. Decide who you are, FBI, police, vigilantes, Neighbourhood Watch, kids in a van. Those who know can rarely act, those with power rarely believe, you must straddle the lines.

SETTING:
Beige computers. Smoking on planes. Colour TV. Pagers. Housewives. 

RULES:
If it just happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't
If you might not succeed, flip a coin. Heads you do
If something bad might happen AS WELL, flip. Heads it doesn't
Apply coins to any outcome
More risk, +1 coin, +1 bad thing
Prepared for exact situation, +1 coin

There are Exceptional people with powers unknown: if they turn to violence, you must stop them. You must save them.

EXCEPTIONS BREAK THE RULES:
They have talents, spells, knacks. You can't beat them with just coins. They have plenty power, little control, no training. They are desperate, scared, sad, hungry, angry, trapped. If they want it, you will die.

Roll twice, combine:
Fire		See
Water		Hear
Earth		Smell
Air		Touch
Metal		Taste
Wood		Music
Mind		Time
Body		Doom
Life		Creation
Death		Nothing

+10 points for "bringing in" Exception. -1 per death, including theirs, including yours.

# This place

 
```
A long time ago, you lived in this place. A long time ago, too, but a few decades more recently, you died here. 

You have been watching ever since. Much has changed. 



Discuss what "this place" will mean for this session. Be open to sharing what excites or discomforts you; be equally open to hearing this from your fellow players.

Here are some starter ideas:

-a floating river-city now beset by rot and flu
-protecting the guardian dragon
-the slow inroads of deer and creeping vines
-the trial and exile of the final monarch
-a people among the stars

Expand on ideas as much as you like. Continue developing "this place" until you feel happy with it, and ready to play in its space.



Then, taking turns, choose an element to put the spotlight on. Feel free to name and choose something new.

Time ticks on. Tell what's happened, using your result as broad, impressionistic inspiration.

Roll 1d12.

1: Sudden, drastic ruin.
2: Inevitable reclamation.
3: Slow coming-apart at the seams.
4: Palimpsest.
5: Delicate new life.
6: Resurgence.
7: Working together.
8: Staying apart.
9: Dogged perseverance.
10: Betrayal.
11: Blood.
12: Thin hope.



Continue play until done.

# Juxtaposeurs

 
```
Assemble 3+ players.  Together, pick a fictional intellectual property that everyone knows.  

Individually, choose one iconic historical photograph (the flag-raising at Iwo Jima, for example) and two visual depictions of easily recognizable in-universe things from the chosen IP (concept art, screenshots, still frames).  Using an image editor, insert the latter into the photograph in any way you choose.  Print the result.  

Voila!  You're now SOPHISTOS, erudite denizens of Meta--a realm that is a fusion of our world and the IP--and hoo-boy, you have LOADS to say about the significance of your particular images.  Take turns presenting them.  What do they depict?  Why are they iconic on Meta?  How did each "define a generation?"  Lean into allegory.  Build on each other's details.  Be verbose.  Be pretentious.  Be "too beaucoup."  

Debate, ramble indefinitely, but don't laugh.  Ever.  Art is fucking serious.  

Anyone who breaks character or chortles is summarily demoted to PHILISTINE status.  Philistines are rubes, unfit to discuss high culture.  They ignorantly point out how goofy Sophistos sound discussing old pictures.  Philistines jeer, making crude jokes until they drag Sophistos down to their level.

When the last Sophisto succumbs (or when the last Philistine falls asleep), destroy the images.

# Muses - Stories Generator

 
```
Everyone has a story to tell, or so the saying goes... Then, how come you - a Writer [player one] cannot come up with even a single tale? You've searched your heart, scoured your soul, poked at your mind and there's nothing. So, you shout and curse all of the gods.

As an answer, lightning strikes and your Muses [other players - up to seven of them] are made manifest! Silently, each of them draws up a paper at random, with the following topics.

Setting|	|Characters	|Plot	|Conflict	|Theme	|Point-of-View		|Tone

[The Muses must fill the topics with additional content, for example, the Setting can be post-apocalyptic fantasy, Characters - a sentient snail, the Plot - the suns have died and everyone must find shelter in the underground; etc.]

Thus, your prayers are answered! But the gods made you work for your new masterpiece. You must spin a tale based on the topics and content provided by the Muses. [If there are fewer than seven Muses, you must come up with content!] You have moments to prepare [~5 minutes] and little time [~20 minutes] to tell the tale.

Once done, one of the Muses becomes the Writer and the cycle begins anew.

# Let's make us whole again
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Depends on what the players come up with! Be kind and sensitive to others. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A group of three to five players gather together to slay the evil cosmic horror wizard Ennui. Players are given templates of characters (GM's choice) and mst add their own flourish and backstory in character creation. The players are then dropped outside the two room dungeon of Ennui itself. In the first room they enter trances and must defeat their inner demons defined at character creation. Between the GM and the other players each player in turn work to defeat or resolve the backstory. After each half hour slot the player may announce whether or not they have dealt with their inner demons. Play for fun, laughs, love and tears. After doing all players they face Ennui and are given 3-5 perks against it depending on previous room. Finish. This all may require an experience GM but players of any level of experience can play and enjoy of course.

# Missing Parts

 
```
In Missing Parts you play broken robots in a scrap heap trying to repair themselves so they can escape. Robots can look like anything but always have thoughts and feelings.

A 52 card playing deck represents scrap parts. Your parts are always face up in front of you. 
Start by memorizing a part from the deck and shuffling it back in. This is your missing part.

On your turn, reveal one part from the deck, describe that part of you and why it evokes the following emotion:
SPADES - anger/frustration
HEARTS - connection/trust 
DIAMONDS - hope/joy 
CLUBS - sadness/despair  

Then choose an action and play a scene using the emotion:
SCAVENGE - take three parts from deck or discard, keep one 
SHARE - share a moment with another, take two cards and they take one
STEAL - steal a card from another 
TRADE - trade with another 
BREAK DOWN - discard four parts to take one from anywhere in the discard

When you obtain four-of-a-kind + your special part, escape the scrap heap. If you have four-of-a-kind but no special part, you may escape but you are broken and changed. When either happens, other players have one round to escape or they remain forever.
