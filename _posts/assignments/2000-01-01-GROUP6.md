# Heroes of the 80's

 
```
The player characters are actionheroes from the 80's.

One person is the director and controls the villains, describe the scenes and outcome.

Phases of the game:

1. Going clockwise the players in order choose 1 thing from the list below and elaborate it. The first players choice is the actual threat that must be defeated at the end. The other choices are obstacles or scenes leading to the end. 

Terrorists with nukes
Giant laser
The President is hostage
Evil Robots
Lasersharks
Gene-manipulated Monkeys
The Girl with the silver dagger
Orbital array
Predator
Dread Gazebo
Submarine


2. The players describe their hero to the other players. Stereotypes are superOK!

3. The director describes the scenes and the players describes the actions of their heroes. Remember that the actual threat is the last scene. 

Each hero starts the game with 2 heropoints.  When performing an action the hero succeed if he uses a heropoint. If he chooses to fail, he instead gain a heropoint. The heroes cannot die unless they sacrifice themselves for the others. Then all other heroes gain a heropoint.  

To defeat the final threat each remaining hero must be able to spend 2 heropoints. Otherwise evil prevails.

# Braggart

 
```
Take turns telling fun, bizarre and over the top stories.
Each tale must contain one of each of the following plot points.
A Truth,    
A Lie
A big Exaggeration
The listeners writes down their private guesses for each and reveal them at the same time. Two points for each matching plot point, and one point for finding a plot point but placing it in the wrong location.
You then rotate to the next player who starts their tale, using the same system.
Repeat until each player has had a go, then tally up the points and find the winner/winners.

# What is the deal with radioactive cannibals?

 
```
The world has ended, and only the people in your hotel survived.  The building is secure and supplies are plentiful. 

All of you were attendees at a Stand Up Comedy Convention. With nothing left to do, you perform routines.  Forever.

During each game (or Show), players take it in turns to perform Sets of an agreed length (one minute is ideal). Each player has three Sets per Show.  

A player's sets should each cover one of the following topics: the player's backstory, the nature of the apocalypse, and the world that remains. (Like all stand-up comedy, actual laughs are ideal, but in no way required).

During the game, players must use the following phrases at least once each:

"Who else remembers..."
"Don't you just hate it when..."
"What is the deal with..."

After each player has performed three Sets, the group should vote on the winner.  Consideration should primarily be given to players who crafted a cohesive character, setting and narrative.  Lesser consideration should be given to whether the comedians were actually funny.

# Open Office Floor Plan

 
```
3-5 Workers and 1 Boss

Workers:

Aspects - Name; Education; Job Title; Personality Quirk.

Stats - Productivity 5/Sanity 4 or the reverse. Zero Boss Points

Pick two other players that owe you a Favor. You can call in a Favor to roll at advantage (roll twice, pick the lowest).

You can offer help at any time so the player rolls at advantage. They now owe you a Favor.

Boss:

Choose projects for the workers to cooperate on. Make sure only one person ever gets credit for the work. Assign project roles that don't match Education or Job Title. Give out Boss Points as they complete work. First worker to 10 points gets promoted.

Resolution - Only call for a roll if there's an interesting chance of failure. Player rolls 1d8 against either productivity or sanity (your choice). If the die roll is equal to or lower than the stat, they succeed. They describe how. Then, they increase the stat used by one and decrease the other by one. On a failed roll, complicate their life.

If they reach 1 Sanity, they have a mental breakdown. If they reach 1 Productivity, they're immediately fired. In both cases, player describes how.

# Shock!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Warfare and death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are medieval infantry. There are a lot of angry horsemen coming your way. This is deeply unpleasant and arguably unfair, but it is your lot in life. Your sole objective is to survive.

Roll d6s, lowest number is in front. Highest is in back. Reroll ties or negotiate until you have a hierarchy.

Describe the battlefield and situation. The course of battle. The state of your commander. Your relationships with each other.

The cavalry are on their way. Before they hit, the first row declares if they Hold or Run, followed by the second row, and so on. Whenever a row Runs, the rows behind them move up to fill their space.

When they hit, everyone who Holds rolls a d6. If you're in the first row, you survive on a 6. In the second, you survive on a 5 or 6. In the third, you die on a 1-3 and Run on 4. Behind third, you die on a 1 and Run on a 2.

If there are 1 or fewer remaining lines, the cavalry breaks through and runs down the retreat. Everyone who Ran rolls a d6. Die on 1-3.

# DICECON

 
```
This game emulates an escalating war. Dedication ultimately decides the victor, not luck. 

Those who dare, win.

------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------

Have real stakes, like cash. Commitment is vital.

Every DICECON level, each competing player/team follows the instructions, and proceeds.

">ROLL" = roll all dice and tally your total.

Dice may have any number of sides, but values cannot exceed them. 
(d100 = valid. d4 with a 5 =/= valid) 

All dice MUST be rolled simultaneously and land flat. Equipment allowed to assist rolling.

Move each dice from field after it's tallied.

Any properly-labeled *fair* object can = dice. No coins/electronics.

Dice untallied after 24h become forfeit.

Highest score wins.

------------------------------------------------------------
