# In Our Courts

 
```
Inner city kids are drawn into a basketball game against demons and play for their futures. Divide the players into Kids and Demons. Give each Kid a name and talent, each Demon a vice. First team to 21 points (pts) wins.

Play starts with a Demon having the ball. They place a Kid in a bad, pressuring situation then passes the ball to the Kid. They describe how they try to overcome the situation. The Kid then decides to Shoot or Pass.

Shoot: Take a shot from the free throw line.
>>>Success: Kids score 2pts
>>>Miss: Demons score 2pts

Pass: Pass the ball to another Kid, who describes how they help. They then Shoot. Successes and Misses now score 3pts.

Demons may choose to Foul a Kid before they Shoot by describing a late complication. If so, a Demon gains a Flagrant and the Kids must now shoot from the 3 point line. 3 point line Successes score 1pt extra while Misses score no points. A Demon with two Flagrants is banished from the game.

No court or b-ball skill? Use a recycling bin, paper ball, and mark your own free throw and 3 point lines.

# Raccoon Island

 
```
You are smart wild animals on a tropical island with no big predators or regular human presence, except for some old ruins. Players pick one animal each to represent: bat, capybara, lemur, tortoise, raccoon. All animals can speak to each other, but not to humans. One of you is a game master who plays for environment and humans. 

Recently, humans arrived to your island and started building something. You animals are keen on driving them away!

During night, animal players describe what are they doing to scare away, misguide, sabotage or otherwise harass the humans in their camp. During day, humans go active behind scenes, possibly exploring, repairing or making traps against you!

To succeed at an action, roll 2d6. If you act like an animal, you succeed on 2-7. If you act in a non-animal manner, you succeed on 8-12. Doubles are complications, at GMs discretion. If you get help of another animal or reasonable advantage, you may reroll one of the dice once.

If animals make humans leave, they win. If humans complete their project and bring more humans to the island, the animals lose.

# Lizard-Sorcerer-Spacemen Agree What to Play

 
```
A game of game creation, for a GM and two or more players.

Everyone needs a pencil, some paper and some dice.

Players each write three SKILLS their character has (eg: Safe-cracking, Charioteering, Laser Guns) on a piece of paper.  These are all revealed simultaneously.

Each player then writes down two FACTS they want to be true of the game-world (eg: magic is illegal, everyone is a dog). These are also revealed simultaneously.

The GM then writes down six FACTS about the game-world in order to enrich and reconcile the players' FACTS and SKILLS  (eg: rocket-chariots with laser cannons).  Two are kept hidden, four are revealed.  

On another sheet, the GM displays the session's primary, secondary and tertiary OBJECTIVES.

Players should then go around and introduce their characters, what role they play in this (probably eclectic) world, and why they want to complete the OBJECTIVES.

Roleplay striving to complete the OBJECTIVES.  Actions with a chance of failure are rolled against a GM set threshold, accounting for SKILLS and good roleplay.

During play, each player may establish one additional FACT or gain one additional SKILL.

Afterwards, discuss the setting you all built, and whether you want to play in it again.

# Song Duel

 
```
You are a second year student at the Bardic College, having learned many of the magical songs of your craft. Like many of your fellows you congregate after class at the Sodden Badger Inn, to practice the ancient art of Song Dueling.

How to Play:

You have to have a way to stream songs upon demand, such as a phone, or Alexa. Pair off with your opponent and begin.

Flip a coin to see who goes first. Whoever is the attacker chooses a song, begins to play it, and spends some time describing the nature of the spell they are casting. When the song is done, the defender gets to cast their counter-song. They too play a song, describing how the spell takes effect. These are all illusions; no direct damage is ever done.

The rest of the players then vote on the winner of the round. The best of three rounds wins.

Example: Jim plays Peace Sells by Megadeath, describing a field of illusionary warriors marching along, etc. Beth, on her turn, plays For Whom the Bell Tolls by Metallica, and describes a scene of Death slaying the soldiers, etc. Everyone votes for Beth. Repeat.

# Floe - Travelling the Multiverse

 
```
Suddenly, the Portal closes behind you. Your group of Shifters is stranded on the world of Awal that is vanishing into non-existence.
 
Can you find the Key to escape this looming doom?
 
First, describe the Shifters.
Every Player contributes two words or short sentences as character-defining Descriptors and one name. Distribute these evenly amongst you all. 

Second, describe your party. 
Together, write down three group-defining Descriptors.

Third, describe the world. 
Together, write down six Descriptors of what is left.

Descriptors are at stake in challenges of relevance to the story:
One success is needed for a relevant deed,
Two for an important deed,
Three for a truly pivotal deed widely recognized as heroic.
Throw one dice per applicable Descriptor. Even numbers count as successes.
 
If you fail, for each success you needed but did not get, any one Descriptor is lost forever (decide narratively).
For each successful pivotal deed, a new Descriptor is created.
 
To begin, the Narrator tells a legend of this realm.

To end the session, the Players tell a legend of what will be remembered.
 
To venture on, give the next world a name and one fewer Descriptor. How far can you go before you perish tragically?

# Night Monsters

 
```
You are boggarts, hobs, bogles, or similar fey creatures that skulk at the edge of society. You are shackled to the humans you hate-their pillows are comfortable, their liquor is marvelous, and their keys are delicious. You lair near what they call a "suburb," and each night you venture from what they call "Puck's Hollow Nature Park" into human houses to steal things and cause trouble. 

Take 7 d6s. Apply 1 to 4 to each of Lurk (hobs are best at being sneaky), Beguile (bogles are best at enchanting mortal minds), and Bully (boggarts can loom frightfully). Choose a Great Fear you must flee from (like running water, mirrors, or clanging windchimes) and a Great Rage you must fight (like dogs, pool toys, or mailboxes).

Roll your appropriate dice when performing a task; rolling any 5 or 6 means success. Failure increases your risk of getting spotted or adds complications. 

At sundown, each night monster picks a different Mischief (such as to break a house's mirrors, steal its whiskey, or befoul its milk). Help each other complete Mischiefs during the night, taking turns narrating to describe Obstacles (such as tall fences, curious teens, angry dogs, or automated sprinklers).
