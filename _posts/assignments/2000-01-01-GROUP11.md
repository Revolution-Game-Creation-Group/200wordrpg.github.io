# In Our Courts

 
```
Inner city kids are drawn into a basketball game against demons and play for their futures. Divide the players into Kids and Demons. Give each Kid a name and talent, each Demon a vice. First team to 21 points (pts) wins.

Play starts with a Demon having the ball. They place a Kid in a bad, pressuring situation then passes the ball to the Kid. They describe how they try to overcome the situation. The Kid then decides to Shoot or Pass.

Shoot: Take a shot from the free throw line.
>>>Success: Kids score 2pts
>>>Miss: Demons score 2pts

Pass: Pass the ball to another Kid, who describes how they help. They then Shoot. Successes and Misses now score 3pts.

Demons may choose to Foul a Kid before they Shoot by describing a late complication. If so, a Demon gains a Flagrant and the Kids must now shoot from the 3 point line. 3 point line Successes score 1pt extra while Misses score no points. A Demon with two Flagrants is banished from the game.

No court or b-ball skill? Use a recycling bin, paper ball, and mark your own free throw and 3 point lines.

# Simple Explorers

 
```
You are an Explorer. As such, you have a NAME, a ROLE, GOALS, and three stats. 

BODY is physical; climbing, hitting, withstanding hits.

SENSES are accuracy, perception, dexterity.

MIND is knowledge, discernment, magical prowess.

Start with two in each, and add four points between them. Whenever you test your skills, divide your stat in half (rounded down) and roll that many d6. Rolls of 4+ are one success each. One success means it works, but only just, and something goes very wrong. Two successes means it works with minor difficulties. Three successes means it works perfectly. For every roll that ends in no successes, mark one exp. Spend three exp to increase a stat by one.

To help an ally, roll the stat they do. For each of your successes, they roll +1d6.

ROLES and GOALS:
Choose a ROLE for yourself; this is who a
you are and what you do. Some examples include: "Boxer", "Hacker", and "Mage"

Also choose a GOAL for yourself; why you wanted to Explore. Some examples include: "Help People", "Prove Myself", and "Make My Fortune".

That's it! You can use this system for any setting, just fit the ROLES and GOALS to your game!

# Untitled goose rpg

 
```
As a group, pick a GM (Goose Master) and pick the setting of your untitled goose rpg.
Example settings: village, castle, space station, military base.

The GM should come up with some locations, some humans to antagonise, and some items for the geese to steal. At worst, let the geese decide. They must bring this loot back to their goose hideout.

Players, roll a horrible goose by first choosing an identifying item.
Example items: eyepatch, flat cap, red ribbon, sunglasses, bandana.

Then assign 0-3 once each to the following stats: RUN, DUCK, HONK, PECK.
Your FLAP stat is 2.

When you do a thing, roll d6 against the appropriate stat.
You succeed if the result is equal to or less than this number.

RUN: Move quickly, feats of agility
DUCK: Move stealthily
HONK: Persuade, intimidate, deceive
PECK: Pick up something, enter combat

FLAP: Attempt to fly.
A goose can add their FLAP to any other stat, provided that player is flapping their arms.
Someone else may have to roll their d6 for them.

If a goose does something particularly horrible, the GM can award them a Horrible Point, which can be exchanged for an instant success on any action.

# The Last Day of the Plague
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, sickness !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
It is the last day of the plague. Many have died, many more will. You will tell their stories.

Each player names one location in the town, then takes three six-sided dice.

Each player holds up a die, speaks a name. Say what they do, what they are like, one thing this person loves. Then place the die in the center.

Once all of the dice are in the center, roll them.

In the first round, the player who was sick last goes first. After, whoever took the lowest numbered die last round will.

The first player chooses a location, says what is happening there.

The player to their left chooses one person and one of the dice. Continue left, doing the same.

If the die is three or less, the person will die of the plague, a four or five, they will be murdered, a six, a tragic accident will befall them.

Play out a scene with these people meeting. Talk about what they love, talk about their hopes and dreams.

When the scene concludes, each player says how that person dies. Speak their last words.

Continue until all the dice are gone, their final stories all told.

# Abyss of Damned Souls

 
```
You're dead.

You got lost and went where all lost things and forgotten places go.

You'll need one suit from a card deck. Take 2-10 and choose one face card.
  Jack is sneaky.
  Queen is charming.
  King is violent.
  Ace is clever.
This small deck is your soul.

Actions have difficulty determined by the Abyss*. Draw a higher card to succeed. When you draw your face card, you automatically succeed and reshuffle your deck. You may discard extra cards to sum them with an already drawn card, but only if the action corresponds to your face card. Discarded cards are gone forever.

In conflict, opponents draw from their decks and the higher card wins. Winner takes the card of the looser, both discard their card in a draw. When only your face card remains, you fade away.

The Abyss will throw obstacles and monsters** in your way, and reward achievements with inhuman powers.

You'll loose pieces of your soul, then patch the holes with stolen bits of others. Your deck will change, until nothing from you remains.

You'll be a monster.

Damn you,
damn us all.


*) Gamemaster
**) Monsters may be customized by the size and value of their deck.

# Shock!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Warfare and death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are medieval infantry. There are a lot of angry horsemen coming your way. This is deeply unpleasant and arguably unfair, but it is your lot in life. Your sole objective is to survive.

Roll d6s, lowest number is in front. Highest is in back. Reroll ties or negotiate until you have a hierarchy.

Describe the battlefield and situation. The course of battle. The state of your commander. Your relationships with each other.

The cavalry are on their way. Before they hit, the first row declares if they Hold or Run, followed by the second row, and so on. Whenever a row Runs, the rows behind them move up to fill their space.

When they hit, everyone who Holds rolls a d6. If you're in the first row, you survive on a 6. In the second, you survive on a 5 or 6. In the third, you die on a 1-3 and Run on 4. Behind third, you die on a 1 and Run on a 2.

If there are 1 or fewer remaining lines, the cavalry breaks through and runs down the retreat. Everyone who Ran rolls a d6. Die on 1-3.

Why are you here? Medical reasons? Cosmetic? In between?
How do you feel in your body?
How do you feel about your body?
Do you feel healthy? Beautiful?
What do you most hope for from surgery?
Play begins as characters gather in plastic surgeon's office.
Each player describes their character and what they choose to read while they wait to see the doctor.
When the silence becomes overwhelming, break it.
Use the flow of conversation to answer questions about yourself and others.
Play ends when a player says "oh, that's me." signalling that they have been called out of the waiting room.
