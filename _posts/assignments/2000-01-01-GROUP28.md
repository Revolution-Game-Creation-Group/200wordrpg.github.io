# The Glass of the Crystal Queen
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Magical Horror, Dehumanization, Loss of Agency !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Fill a single glass with icy water and two d4s. Set it at the table's center; this is the Glass of The Crystal Queen.

One of you plays The Queen: powerful, manipulative, at war with her sisters, and the narrator of this story.

The rest play Her Cavaliers: 
Write down 4 Emotions; Rank them Strongest-4 to Weakest-1.
Write down 5 Memories from before your bargain.

             She kept Her promise.


                    For now, you serve Her...

                           ...and she will tell you who you are.

The Queen names each Cavalier and erases 2 Memories-taking them (she's already taken many others.)

Complete Her Task and regain 1 Memory. Regain 10 to recall your True Name and break free.

When you Act, The Queen declares a Difficulty and Consequence for failure:

* Easy 1-3
* Challenging 4-6
* Legendary 7-8

Equal or overcome the Difficulty using an Emotion to Succeed.
If needed, draw on Her power: Reach into her Glass, withdraw the dice, roll them back into the Glass-add the total.

On double 1s, erase a Memory.
If you miss the Cup, erase a Memory.
If your Memories get wet, erase a Memory.
If you lose all your Memories, you are hers forever.

# Glorious leader is Dead!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, political backstabbing !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Comrade of the Glorious Revolution! The president is dead. Turn on a radio (or song, or podcast, or Video); the next sentence you hear were his/her last words. Each person is a member of the ruling party.

Sequester everyone until you can create a unified front behind a new President. Anyone who enters needs to be sworn to secrecy.

Everyone takes turns declaring their position in the cabinet before the death of the President. Using social media, phones, etc, reach out to people to seek their support for your position as President, but without letting them know that the President is dead. These people are Members of the Glorious Revolution.

If two or more people gain the purported support of the same Member of the Glorious, they each need to make a speech to the remaining members of the cabinet. Everyone in the room then votes to award the support of those Members to one of the people giving a speech.

First person to a majority of at least 10 supporters becomes the new President and gets to decide their cabinet.

# Dungeon Core!

 
```
You are elemental spirits, subservient to a Dungeon Core (DC).  DCs use and consume Mana exclusively gathered from the environment and adventurers inside their Territory.
Players control traps and monsters, and the GM controls invaders.
Together, design a labyrinthian Dungeon with treasure, monsters, and traps to attract and kill adventurers!  Keep expanding to attract stronger adventurers, but be careful - too challenging or too stingy, and they may stop coming!

Mana gains:
Event                 Gain
Ambient               1/hour
Adventurer present    3/hour/Adventurer
Adventurer dies       60 + 1/5 stat points

Sample Mana costs:
Item                                 Cost
Build 5×5 space                      2
1GP-worth of treasure                0.5
Trap                                 1 per stat point (choose only 1 stat)
Monster                              0.25 per stat point
Increase Territory radius            1/foot
Change w/Adventurers in Territory    x10

Adventurer/Monster stats:
Brawn*
Cunning*
Agility* (defends against Agility)
Mana* (magical attacks)
Physical Resistance (defends against Brawn)
Magical Resistance (defends against Mana)
Health^
* also a Trap stat.
^ Health = 6 + Brawn

Newbie Adventures have 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 to distribute among their stats.
Stats depict the number of d6 you roll.  Damage = Attacker's Dice minus Defender's.
Items add directly to stats (shortsword = +1 Brawn).
Traps reset automatically.  Monsters must be re-summoned.

# Open Mic at a Funeral
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, disrespect for the dead !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A terrible game for 5+ people.
 
You are at the funeral for someone you barely knew. You were not personally invited, but it was an open invitation. Those who were officially asked to speak have said their words, and now it's time for the open mic. A facilitator must tally points and keep time to ensure everyone speaks for five long, uncomfortable minutes.
 
Speakers gain five points per each of the following:
·      Make a statement about how you don't want to take up too much time.
·      Sneak in an admission about how little you interacted with the deceased.
·      Incorporate an object into your speech. Ex: a paperclip the deceased once loaned you.
·      Tell an inappropriate story about the deceased.
·      Tell an utterly boring story about an interaction with the deceased.
·      Make an impossibly grand statement about how much the deceased meant to you.
·      Fake cry.
·      Humble-brag.
·      Incorporate an impromptu performance about the deceased that you are ill-prepared for.
·      Claim you share something with the deceased that nobody else does.
 
Players may refer to the list. The game is over once everyone has had a turn to speak. Whoever has the most points wins.

# IF/THEN, a Diceless Paranormal Victorian RPG
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: imperialism, Rudyard Kipling, death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
	How do actual people deal with the mechanical empire of Victoria, mingled with the moralistic horror of Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard Kipling? When social order is tyranny and deviation is demonic, what is a paranormal investigator to do?
Characters distribute 15 points across 4 attributes: Logic (costs double), Quickness, Perceptiveness, and Vitality. Players can petition the referee for a special ability and corresponding disadvantage.	
	Characters attempting feats of skill, observation, and the like compare the relevant attribute to a difficulty threshold assigned by the referee. Three is average. No rolling is involved. If you have a low perceptiveness, you're going to miss most potential clues.
Danger and confrontations: Each round you write your main action. For each point of logic, write a conditional If/Then statement to respond to an action you think another person might do. In descending quickness order, people perform their main actions. If this triggers If/Then statements, those interrupt it. If one action has multiple responses, resolve in descending quickness order.
Injuries give -1 vitality. At 0 you are incapacitated or dead. An exception: bullets put you down in just one or two hits.
