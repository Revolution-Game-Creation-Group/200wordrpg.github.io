# The Glass of the Crystal Queen
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Magical Horror, Dehumanization, Loss of Agency !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Fill a single glass with icy water and two d4s. Set it at the table's center; this is the Glass of The Crystal Queen.

One of you plays The Queen: powerful, manipulative, at war with her sisters, and the narrator of this story.

The rest play Her Cavaliers: 
Write down 4 Emotions; Rank them Strongest-4 to Weakest-1.
Write down 5 Memories from before your bargain.

             She kept Her promise.


                    For now, you serve Her...

                           ...and she will tell you who you are.

The Queen names each Cavalier and erases 2 Memories-taking them (she's already taken many others.)

Complete Her Task and regain 1 Memory. Regain 10 to recall your True Name and break free.

When you Act, The Queen declares a Difficulty and Consequence for failure:

* Easy 1-3
* Challenging 4-6
* Legendary 7-8

Equal or overcome the Difficulty using an Emotion to Succeed.
If needed, draw on Her power: Reach into her Glass, withdraw the dice, roll them back into the Glass-add the total.

On double 1s, erase a Memory.
If you miss the Cup, erase a Memory.
If your Memories get wet, erase a Memory.
If you lose all your Memories, you are hers forever.

# The Old Ways

 
```
Christendom has invaded Westland Isle. You are a creature of lore. If no one believes in you, you cease to exist. Goal: Shake faith of the locals so they continue to cling to the old ways. You can't cause them physical harm, but you can show them what true hell looks like.


Choose a class-selkie, shapeshifting water spirit, +1 dice near water; banshee, wailing harbinger of doom, roll fear to curse a target and succeed on 6+ against them; Gwyllion, ghostly night wanderer, +1 dice to skulk in darkness; sluagh, troublesome restless spirit, +1 dice to fear


Stats: Presence-social, for fear or charm; Skulk-physical, for sneaking or hiding; Insight-mental, for planning and reading opponents. Resolve-dedication to your cause. Divide 3-2-1 between presence-skulk-insight. Resolve starts at 5 and acts like health. Roll dice equal to your stat to perform tasks. 7+ is a success.


Townsfolk start with Fear equal to zero and Faith from 1-6. Insight detects faith and fear, presence attacks them. Townsfolk roll Faith for and against attacks. Fear subtracts from faith, but townsfolk eventually flee from fear. When a townsfolk's faith drops to zero, they become a heathen and deny the mainland's religious influence.

# Escape from Translucidia

 
```
Three scavengers must cross a nightmarish city to bring supplies back to their colony. They will face perils from without and within.

Each player has 10 check-boxes representing supplies.

On your turn, roll 2d10. Describe a scene for the other two, using indicated prompts:

  ( WITHIN )                   ( WITHOUT )
1. CONFESSION             DARKNESS
2. BETRAYAL                  HEIGHT
3. SACRIFICE                  DEPTH
4. PHOBIA                       REFLECTION
5. MEMORY                     HUNTING
6. SECRET                       TRAP
7. EPIPHANY                   ILLUSION
8. LIE                                SPEED
9. TRUTH                         NOISE
10. INSECURITY             SILENCE      

Cross off prompts when used. If re-rolled, use the next.

In a scene, take turns building on what's described. When peril is imminent, each roll 1d10, and collaboratively resolve the scene using indicated prompts:

1-3: You lose some supplies. Mark off one check-box. If you have none, check another player's.

4-6: You are impaired, but you carry on.

7-9: You narrowly escape the peril.

10: You discover additional supplies. Add a new check-box.

When 9 of each scene prompts have been crossed off, you return to the colony.

Roll 1d10, add remaining supplies, and collaboratively epilogue:

30+: The colony will thrive.
20-30: The colony will survive.
10-20: Not everyone will survive.
<10: The colony will collapse.

# Manus artificis in caelis: WIZARD EDITION

 
```
To play, you will need 1-5 players, one four- and one twenty-sided die per player, and a large pile of other dice.

Each player builds a Wizard Tower by rolling and stacking dice. If you wish, you may speak in character as your Wizard.

Players take turns building their towers. To build a tower, roll a die, add a description based on the die rolled as described below, then add that die to the top of your tower. Roll and stack your d4 to complete your tower.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you roll a ____, describe _______:
d6: the tower's appearance
d8: the tower's residents
d10: a collaborator or rival of your Wizard
d12: a magical feat of your Wizard
d20: your Wizard
d4: your Wizard's legacy
Other: minor magical mishaps or mayhem

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You get a number of words of description equal to the result of the die roll.

If you tower falls, accidentally or on purpose, describe the downfall of your Wizard  You may choose to start again with a new Wizard. Knocking over another Wizard's tower intentionally is grounds for banishment from the realm.

To play competitively, the first person to finish a tower with die rolls totaling 50+ wins.

# Times Gone By
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: References to Alcohol. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Gather a few of your oldest friends to remember the Good ol' Days when life was hard but times were good.

Begin by pouring each other a round of drinks. The oldest then welcomes you all, takes a hearty swig of their drink, and regales you with their favorite story of your times together.

If someone thinks the teller forgot something or missed something important, they take a hearty swig and remind them of what they missed. Such occasions are met with grumbles and the drinking of drinks or apologies and the nodding of heads. Mistakes are fixed and missing details are worked into the tale.

If someone thinks the teller got something wrong, they take a hefty gulp of drink and explain how it *really* happened. Such occasions are met with raucous chatter as the drinker now tells the story.

Anyone finishing their drink gets the final say. Drink-less drinkers may still assert afterwards, albeit unreliably or unconvincingly.

The tale isn't worth ending if the table runs out of drink. Pour another round, tell a different tale. 

If a tale reaches its end, raise your glasses and toast to the Good ol' Days. Down your drinks and pour another.
