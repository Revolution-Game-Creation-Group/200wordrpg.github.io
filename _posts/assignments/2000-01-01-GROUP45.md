# We Love You Nino's Pizza
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, Mourning, Grief !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Nino has passed away. 

Nino's Pizza must live on. 

You are Nino's family and friends. 

You loved Nino very much, and now he is gone. 

Who were you to Nino?

Linger through the five stages of grief. Each stage, work towards healing. Take care of yourself and your family. Take care of business. Keep the pizza place and his memory alive. 

Denial. Do you stay open the day it happens? 

Bargaining. What do you regret about how it happened? If only...

Anger. Do the regulars still come in?

Depression. Can anyone make the sauce the way Nino did?

Acceptance. What makes you remember him and smile?

If these stages don't speak to you, think up some new ones. 

After each stage, take turns writing a sign for the outside of the restaurant. Write three of each letter of the alphabet on scraps of paper. Randomly remove 10 pieces from your pile. Neighborhood teens stole those letters. Write your sign with the rest of the letters. Use it to share the experience of your grief with the world...or advertise your pizza. Know that as your community drives by, they are touched by the combination of letters you create.

# Under the Gaze of the Watchful Sun

 
```
One player is the sun, the other the planet orbiting it. The sun player goes first, and roles a d6 to determine what kind of sun they are.

1 = A large, yellow sun with many sunspots.
2 = Two twin suns, burning dimly.
3 = A sun whose solar winds cause auroras of rose and lilac and gold.
4 = A sun prone to being eclipsed by the moon.
5 = A white sun, which periodically develops green-tinged flares.
6 = A sun that is dying.

These types should be augmented by further description from the sun player.

The planet player describes the type of world the sun's rays have created and the life that inhabits it. Afterwards, they roll a d6 to determine their planet's first space mission.

1 = An uncrewed probe.
2 = A ship with domesticated animal(s).
3 = A craft bearing lichens/algae/mold.
4 = A vessel with a crew of one.
5 = A craft containing recordings of the planet's music.
6 = A ship staffed by two or more.

The first flight should be augmented by further description from the planet player.

The sun player then describes how the sun looks upon this first foray. With tenderness, fury, regret, or something else?

# The Inevitable Decision (1 GM & 1+ Players)

 
```
"You used to be a barista. Now, you're a God... AND a barista." This game is about balancing humanity and newly-discovered divinity, and the inevitable decision you must face.

About-You
- Name
- Domain
- Dayjob
- The Scale. Where you stand between your Mortal life and your Divine powers. 3 Divine = -3 Mortal, and vice-versa. +3 Max.
- Bonds-Alliances. These represent your Mortal & Divine relationships. You have thirteen of each.

When there's uncertainty, determine if you're performing Mortal or Divine actions. For Mortal Actions, roll 1d6+Mortal+Bonds. For Divine Actions, roll 1d6+Divine+Alliances. 1-3 = Fail. 4-6 = Success. You may spend Alliances-Bonds to boost Mortal-Divine actions respectively.

When you help people, or otherwise prioritize humanity, you may gain a bond or shift towards Mortal. You lose an Alliance. When you ignore people, or otherwise prioritize Divinity, you may gain an Alliance or shift towards Divine. You lose a Bond.

The Decision. What young Gods fear. Will you give up on humanity or divinity? When you have no Bonds, you have no reason to stay. You leave and become a God forever. When you have no Alliances, you have no power among Gods. You give up and remain human.

# Breadcrumbs

 
```
Each player is an investigator. Start only with faint description of crime or perpetrator.

Allocate 4, 6, 8, 10 between soldier, investigator, scientist and negotiator traits. Lower is better.

Active player alternates and frames and resolves his scene. Take your time, let other players take part as NPC's and help you tell story. Each scene ends with roll. Choose trait that suits best and roll 2d6.

If you rolled equal or higher to chosen trait, add its value to success pool and describe how you moved the investigation forward.

If you ever collect 25 points per player, investigators win. Tell epilogue together.

If you rolled less, take hit or obstruct investigation.

To take hit, increase trait you just used by 3 and describe how you were irreversibly damaged. If you cannot (because it will be more than 12), you can leave story instead. Tell your epilogue how you died or became crazy...

Alternatively you can obstruct investigation. Play a flashback scene from the perpetrator's point of view. Prepare some trap to investigators. From now everyone will get -1 to their rolls. If this is ever done five times, perpetrator wins. Describe epilogue what happened, everyone should take part.

# Magic PANIC!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Disasters, Death, Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
As brave emergency service workers, players must use magic to arrive at and resolve crises daily.
One player is the reporter who chooses and depicts the emergencies instead.
Start the game with at least three emergencies.
Example: Breaking News! Warehouse fire across town caused by batteries is spreading, employees are trapped inside the building, a chemical cloud is moving over the city!
Magic governs play, with players casting spells following the format:
"I want to [protect, harm, alter] [object, person] with a [line, field, ball] of [fire, water, wind, earth, lightning]"
A d12 is rolled to determine a positive (>=4) or negative (<4) outcome.
A negative outcome downgrades the player's dice (e.g. d12 becomes d10).
A player is removed in dramatic fashion when they downgrade a d4.
Example: I want to protect the labourers with a ball of water! *Rolls 3 on d4*
The reporter interprets the spell and narrates outcome.
Negative outcomes change emergencies and positive outcomes resolve emergencies.
Example: The water ball amasses from your fluids; you die and begin drowning employees!
The game ends with a news report when either the players are removed, or all the emergencies are cleared.

# You bloody shot me!

 
```
You bloody shot me!

A drug deal gone wrong. An abandoned building. A gang of bleeding criminals. A bag full of cash.

Each player needs 
-	D6. 
-	Pin.  
-	Balloon full of water.

Look to your left, give that player a "codename" of any object in sight that is their character.

Each player holds their full balloon above the table, this is your Health. At the start of the game each player takes their pin and puts a hole in the balloon of the player on their right, this is your wound.

If a player's balloon empties, they are gone and their dice is removed.

Dice must stay in the middle of the table. To overcome an obstacle, roll all the dice. 
To succeed each dice needs to roll 4+ you can re-roll failures as many times as needed.

Use your free hand to try and cover the hole in your balloon or use your pin to add holes to other players balloons.

If you put down your balloon you can take no actions.

Get out of the building alive with the cash and escape while the GM throws obstacles in between you and the getaway van.

# Rogue Demon Hunters

 
```
You are Rogue Demon Hunters. You do not hunt demons. 

NOTE: Demons can be anything.

One player, the MARK, offers a quest: Hunt the DEMON.

Don't. 

Return to the Mark. Make up a story.

   Your character has a fake Persona: [Name] the [Adjective] ("Yoksur the Mighty"), with a fake backstory.
   Skills: BOAST, FLEX, and FAKE. 
   Choose: two are 1d6, one 2d6. 
   5-6 = success.

   Boast: lie stylishly.
   Flex: demonstrate prowess. 
   Fake: provide "proof" (demon head, etc.). 

Demon Ratings (The Mark decides): 50+. 50 = easy. 1,000 = legendary.
The Mark can challenge your facts, your prowess, or require proof. 
Roll one skill to convince. 
Succeed and earn WOW. The Mark decides how much. 1 = barely, 5 = completely.
Faked proof can be retconned into existence.
When WOW > DR, receive gold = WOW / 5, or continue for more.
If you fail a roll, gain DOUBT, 1-5 (the Mark's choice). When DOUBT > WOW + 5, you fail.
For every successful hunt, gain 1 FAME. 
For each unsuccessful hunt, gain 1 INFAMY. 
If INFAMY > FAME, leave town and create new persona.

Spend gold on glitzy fake gear. Every 5 gold spent = 1 reroll on a failed convince. 
Spend 20 gold to lose 1 Infamy.
