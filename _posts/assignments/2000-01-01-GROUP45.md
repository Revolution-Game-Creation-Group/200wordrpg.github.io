# We Love You Nino's Pizza
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, Mourning, Grief !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Nino has passed away. 

Nino's Pizza must live on. 

You are Nino's family and friends. 

You loved Nino very much, and now he is gone. 

Who were you to Nino?

Linger through the five stages of grief. Each stage, work towards healing. Take care of yourself and your family. Take care of business. Keep the pizza place and his memory alive. 

Denial. Do you stay open the day it happens? 

Bargaining. What do you regret about how it happened? If only...

Anger. Do the regulars still come in?

Depression. Can anyone make the sauce the way Nino did?

Acceptance. What makes you remember him and smile?

If these stages don't speak to you, think up some new ones. 

After each stage, take turns writing a sign for the outside of the restaurant. Write three of each letter of the alphabet on scraps of paper. Randomly remove 10 pieces from your pile. Neighborhood teens stole those letters. Write your sign with the rest of the letters. Use it to share the experience of your grief with the world...or advertise your pizza. Know that as your community drives by, they are touched by the combination of letters you create.

# Trashbots

 
```
Crudely built, simplistically programmed, and expendable, only Trashbots leave the detritus-encircled Fortress, braving ruins, mutants, and corrupted bots in search of meaning and treasures among trash.
 
Players: One GM, others are Trashbots.

Dice sizes (least to greatest) are:
Destroyed, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, NaN.
 
Trashbot ATTRIBUTES are: Power, Finesse, Logic. Assign to them a d10, d8, and d6 in any order. Select two monosyllabic actions for your PURPOSE. Start with 0 FULFILLMENT.

GM: describes situation.
Trashbots: describe actions. 

For uncertain outcomes, roll the relevant ATTRIBUTE die against the GM's die (d4 to d12, depending on difficulty, d6 being average). With relevant PURPOSE, roll ATTRIBUTE and a PURPOSE d6, then choose one.

Rolling higher succeeds.
 
Rolling lower fails and DEGRADES rolled ATTRIBUTE one size.
 
When tied, succeed but DEGRADE rolled ATTRIBUTE.
 
Success achieved via the PURPOSE d6 earns FULFILLMENT. Failing despite rolling PURPOSE loses FULFILLMENT.

Exception: Upon rolling the maximum value on an ATTRIBUTE die, Trashbot must ignore all other results. Succeed and UPGRADE the ATTRIBUTE one size. Describe your unwieldy improvement.  
 
If any ATTRIBUTE is Destroyed/NaN, Trashbot dies/becomes corrupted.
 
Upon completing mission: with at least 2 FULFILLMENT, rest fulfilled among the trash. Else, wander aimlessly until corrupted.

# Mahou Shoujo Magical Babysitter

 
```
A game for 4 players:
* Babysitter
* Kids
* Parents
* EVIL

Kids:
Play all children. Be troublesome.
Also play all imaginary or fanciful people.

Parents:
Play the parents. Be aloof.
Also play all boring people.

Babysitter:
You must take care of the Kids. You should fix the Parents, too. You face EVIL on the 7th Night.
Also play your magical minions.
After the 7th scene, EVIL attacks the world 7 times. Roll a d6 and describe stopping the attack. Add Love when you use moral virtue. Add Discipline when you use cool superpowers. On a 7+, you do it. If you stop 5 attacks, EVIL loses. Otherwise, the world ends.

EVIL:
Destroy the world!
And introduce complications during scenes to undermine the Babysitter.
Also play all jerk and monsters.
After the 7th scene, describe your 7 Attacks.

Play 7 scenes over 7 days. Any player may set a scene, but each must do so at least once.

In scenes, players describe their characters' actions, words, nearby events, powerful magic, etc.

After each scene, if the Kids felt loved they award the Babysitter 1 Love. If the Parents think the Babysitter did their job, they award them 1 Discipline.

# Murder She Did

 
```
Choose a setting. Somewhere remote.

Everyone invents a character to play.

Each player gives their character a connection with another willing player's character. Daughter, business partner, indebted, lover, fan... Keep going round and adding links until everyone has at least three. These may be secrets but at least two characters must know each one.

Each player writes down one character they want to protect and one they want to go to jail.

One character, chosen randomly, is then murdered by little old lady. The murdered character's player now plays this woman. She likes to "solve" the murders she commits. 

In character, discuss who could have committed the murder. The little old lady can use the facts she learns to accuse someone of the murder. Any player can counter accusations with appropriate facts about the relations between the characters.

When time is up, or all relationships have been revealed, the police arrive and the little old lady explains who did it and why. If no one can counter the accusation the police believe her and she gets away with murder again.

Otherwise the other characters can make their own accusations. The police will believe the most convincing reasoning.

# Chair
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Existential Horror, Being Physically Restrained, Being Ignored !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Quiet terror, for one and onlookers

Instruct onlookers that they should not be worried or disturbed by anything they see. You are playing a game and can stop at any time. They must not intervene.

Collect a chair to sit on. It should be from a different room or place, move it into this new context. It is a stranger to this place.

Once it's moved, sit down. Grip the base of the chair firmly with both hands. Wrap your legs around the legs of the chair. Sit up straight if possible. The chair now has a hold of you. You cannot stand up until the game is over.

Next begin to struggle fruitlessly. The chair is holding you down. The chair won't let go. The chair never listens. The chair must hate you. The chair is a spiteful thing. The chair entangles you ever further. The chair keeps you.

No escape.

No hope.

You may attempt to scream, but no sound comes out. Nothing can offer any help. The onlookers will ignore your pleas. You asked them to. You are playing a game, but you are trapped.

Then, suddenly. You may stand. Do whatever you wish to the chair.

# Doppelgänger

 
```
Doppelgänger is a game that is played while you do other things with your group, like going out or during game night. 


You are a colony of shapeshifting creatures preparing to first take over the town and then, the world. You need to practice your impersonation skills to pass as different humans, but if you adopt too many of your target's mannerisms and personality you'll get lost in the act and won't be able to shapeshift out of it. 


The objective of the game is to lightly act as your real self. You already look like them, but now you have to imitate a mild version of yourself. If you do something that the colony deems as being too much as your real self, you'll lose.

You can prepare something to counteract this too faithful of an imitation. Hide an object in your pockets that you'd never use, wear some unseen clothing that is the opposite of your style... However, you can only have one safeguard; if you fail again you'll lose definitely.


You can add weird creature-like demeanors here and there for flavor and fun. The winners are those who remain in play at the end of the session.

# Romancing the home

 
```

a human and a building have fallen in love, and this is a game about that for two players. the game occurs over the course of three rounds, each representing a decade. each player draws five cards from a 52 card deck. the suits of the cards represent their character's desire. the values represent how understandable those desires are.

before the first round, the players decide which character they are playing: human, or building. they should each describe their characters to each other-their names, pronouns, ages, structural motifs, etc.

during each round both players choose a card from their hand and play them simultaneously. compare the cards, noting the difference in suits & values. consult the tables below to determine what the characters desire, and narrate a scene about that. two cards from the same suit always result in an understanding, regardless of value.

after three rounds, the players must choose one of their two remaining cards to represent how their character feels when they eventually part ways, as humans and buildings always do.


value difference		result
--------------------------------------------------------
0-2				understanding
3-5				not understanding
6+				misunderstanding


suit				desire
--------------------------------------------------------
hearts				tenderness, admiration
diamonds			publicity, celebration
spades				privacy, distance
clubs				roughness, antagonism
