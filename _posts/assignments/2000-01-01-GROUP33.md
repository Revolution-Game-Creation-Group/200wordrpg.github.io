# Dice Friends
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Sickness, Death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Line up a set of polyhedral dice.  Use some old dice that are full of stories, use some new dice that've never been rolled.  Tuck the d20 into a warm pocket.

The dice in the line are all old friends.  Think about their personalities, their lives, their friendships.  What do they talk about?  Say they words they are saying to each other.  You can talk with them too!

Move the dice to a new place, let them look around.  Introduce the d20.  Say "Hi friends, I'd like you all to meet someone new!"  They are going to hit it off, I promise.  Let the dice have small adventures for as long as you like.  At some point tell them the d4 is sick.

About a month of dice time later you will pick up all the dice and roll them.  Whichever dice rolled lowest have died.

You'll need to tell the survivors the sad news.  Let them grieve.  This is hard for everyone.  Dispose of the deceased dice appropriately.

Roll the dice again.  Odd rolling dice stick around though it's never the same.  Even rolling dice leave; abandon them around town as you think appropriate.  They live without you now.

# Witches in a well

 
```
You are witches in a well, hurtling through space and time, escaping said place by creating a spell with a suitable rhyme.

Each round you arrive at a location, which, in your desperation, each witch describes with a word, until everyone's been heard.

Now each witch wagers an appropriate possession, maybe a piece of their garment as concession, to sacrifice for the spell to decamp their cell.

One starts at random, attempting a rhyme, with all of these words, in but one minute's time.

Should the witch fail, you all have to bail, and try again on the next rotation.

Describe again this new location, once more wager an oblation, then it is the next witch's vocation to attempt the spell to save you from the well.

When the locations bested equals the number of witches, however divested, the spell is complete, the hurtling rested, and the witches freed.

If personal affairs become dangerously scarce, and you run out of witchy wares, you're stuck in these nightmares, and sheer out of good luck.

# DEATH RACE 20XX-500: SURVIVE, THRIVE, DRIVE

 
```
PLAYERS: 2+ | MATERIALS: Paper + Pen(cil)

DEATH RACE 20XX-500 is a game of cooperative survival. Imprisoned in a lethal track with a car and your comrades, you must complete the race while stopping corporate race sponsors from profiting off your televised demise.

BEGIN
Design your car. A car must be able to: MOVE, STOP, and CARRY A DRIVER. Otherwise, it can be anything.

SOCIALIZE
Name your car, then introduce your vehicle/yourself to the other racers. You're each other's greatest hope.

RACE
The DEATH RACE 20XX is 500 miles. An obstacle arises every 50 miles that can destroy whoever passes through.

DESIGNING OBSTACLES
Brainstorm the most dangerous barrier/trick/trap possible. It is now in the way of every driver. Sketch the racetrack and obstacles. Give them names as enjoyable as your car's.

OVERCOMING OBSTACLES
Work with your fellow drivers to figure a way out. If there seems to be no path forward, drivers can automatically pass if one driver sacrifices themself. If that's you, describe your sacrifice and check off the obstacle. 

FINISH
If every driver dies or all obstacles are overcome, the game ends. 

When you reach the end, you're free. How does it feel?

# Bullshit, LLC
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Imposter Syndrome, Unemployment !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Your resume is so padded you could wear it to keep the chill off. The problem? You've been tapped for The Big Project. Your goal? Don't get found out as a complete fraud.

Each player describes their character. State their name and job title. Any non-executive occupation is allowed. The GM describes the company, however much they choose.

Players need five bullshit tokens (cards, coins, beer koozies, etc) apiece.

When challenged by the GM, players roll 1d6. If they roll under their number of bullshit tokens, they succeed. If not, lose one bullshit token.

Players may corroborate their bullshit: roll 1d6 per corroborating player against their total number of bullshit tokens. Rolling under is a success.

Players may also call bullshit on other players. Roll 1d6. If the roll is higher than the other player's number of bullshit tokens, the other player is called out and loses a bullshit token.

Once per game, a player may double down on their bullshit - roll twice and take the higher number.

Rolls that tie count as successes.

If a player loses all bullshit tokens, they're fired. They can relax. Unwind. Update their resume.

# Fish Tale
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Reference to alcohol. Questionable puns. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You and your fishin' buddies had a helluva day on the water. Time to brag about your catch!

Choose a BARTENDER (GM). Players are ANGLERS.

ANGLERS start with two coins and a d6.

The BARTENDER will need three coins each in three piles labeled HUMAN, FISH and STUFF.



GEAR

ANGLERS have fancy GEAR. Pick from the below GEAR, two per ANGLER. No repeating GEAR.

Spring-loaded Rod
Captain's Hat
Lifelike Lure
Master Bait
High-tech Reel
Tough Net
Brewski Belt
Braided Line
Tide Chart
Weather Report
Guidebook
Fish Finder
First Aid Kit
10-in-1 Multi-tool
Folded Steel Knife



BARTENDERS - if part of the story seems fishy, interrupt and call for a HUMAN, FISH or STUFF roll. The ANGLER rolls their d6.

Roll equal or lower than the number of coins in the called pile to succeed. 

Remove a coin from the pile on failure. When there is one coin in each pile, the ANGLERS are caught in their lie! 

If an ANGLER uses their GEAR in their action, roll 2d6. 



BUYING BEERS

ANGLERS can add their coins to the BARTENDER'S piles to make rolls easier. 

If the ANGLER'S story impresses the BARTENDER, give that ANGLER a coin that has been removed.

# Dear Friend...

 
```
For 2 players using letters written from the perspective of their character, sent via snail mail. There are 8 exchanges, for a total of 16 letters. 7 rounds have predetermined prompts, as follows:

Home
Hope
Love
Hate
Fear
Light
Darkness

 The 8th is chosen by player 1. Prompts are intentionally vague. 

Player 1 is the person who most recently received personal correspondence. They write a classified ad seeking their ideal pen-pal, 40 words or less, including their mailing address and an inspiration for setting. The ad ends with the eighth prompt. They share this ad using the method of their choice. 

Example:
Pen Pal for conversation. Must love storytelling and have diverse interests. Ideally lives near a temporal vortex. 8 River Dr., Pallino, MA, 99999. FLAME.
Player 2 responds, and play continues back and forth.

When writing a letter, roll a D6 and compare the result to the numeral of the day the most recent letter was postmarked. If both are odd or both even, the prompt results in a "good" outcome. Otherwise, it is "bad". Players determine what this means. 

Be creative. Suggestions include hand-made envelopes, lovely cards, pictures, or flowers.

# 002: License to Eavesdrop

 
```
  
You and your Partner: secret super-spies.

The next social gathering that you both attend: a Mission.

While out in public (perhaps en route to Mission) listen for Code Words. When you overhear a seemingly random phrase that sounds like it might be your Code Words, confirm it with your Partner. Then, your Partner does the same. Each of you arrives at the Mission with personal Code Words.

Give the Code Words as a sign-without tipping your hand to Enemy Agents, who are everywhere.

Mingle at the gathering within earshot of your Partner. Work your Code Words naturally into conversation. If the person you're speaking to treats the Code Words as normal, you've successfully given the sign to a Contact. Give the Contact the Agency-approved confirmation signal (a friendly smile).

If the person you're speaking to reacts as if the Code Words/your behavior are odd, you've been caught by an Enemy Agent! Your Partner steps in to cover for you while you find a quiet corner of the gathering and whisper into your watch (or microchip embedded in your wrist) "Cover blown, extraction requested."

If both of you keep your cover, whoever gave Code Words to the most Contacts wins.
