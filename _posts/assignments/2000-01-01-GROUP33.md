# Dice Friends
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Sickness, Death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Line up a set of polyhedral dice.  Use some old dice that are full of stories, use some new dice that've never been rolled.  Tuck the d20 into a warm pocket.

The dice in the line are all old friends.  Think about their personalities, their lives, their friendships.  What do they talk about?  Say they words they are saying to each other.  You can talk with them too!

Move the dice to a new place, let them look around.  Introduce the d20.  Say "Hi friends, I'd like you all to meet someone new!"  They are going to hit it off, I promise.  Let the dice have small adventures for as long as you like.  At some point tell them the d4 is sick.

About a month of dice time later you will pick up all the dice and roll them.  Whichever dice rolled lowest have died.

You'll need to tell the survivors the sad news.  Let them grieve.  This is hard for everyone.  Dispose of the deceased dice appropriately.

Roll the dice again.  Odd rolling dice stick around though it's never the same.  Even rolling dice leave; abandon them around town as you think appropriate.  They live without you now.

# Advent

 
```
"There are only bodies and languages, but there are also truths." --Alain Badiou

This is a game of microhistoriography. It is concerned with the emergence of complex and compromised subjectivities in times of crisis and revolution. 

To begin, describe the situation. For simplicity, limit your description to the following four conditions: science, art, politics, love. Provide as little or as much detail for each as you feel is necessary. 

Pick one condition to experience a rupture. A rupture is the event of a truth appearing in the situation. A truth is that which transforms the terms of the situation. 

This transformation occurs in four distinct stages: nomination, intervention, fidelity, forcing. This is the truth-procedure, the process by which bodies are made into subjects.

Nomination (the event is named). How does language change?

Intervention (the event is elaborated). How is life impacted?

Fidelity (the event is solidified). How do you orient yourself toward it?

Forcing (the situation expands according to the event). How do you find your place?

When the truth-procedure is finished, discuss how it will be remembered in five years, fifty years, five hundred years. 

All this is an experiment in the eternal.

# The Kid From Utah

 
```
The Kid from Utah
A game of awkward teenage interactions
Requires: 4 players, pens, index cards, a coin

Instructions:
- Choose one player to be the Kid, a robot who looks exactly like a human teenager.  Something's gone wrong, so the Kid's creators dumped them in generic modern suburbia but botched the memory deletion routine.

- Label four cards "Personal," "Social," "Culture," and "Other."  Each player writes one memory on each card, e.g. "I have six siblings," "girls/boys like it when you them ask a lot of questions," "<band> is so cool."  Give them to the Kid.

- Together, choose (1) a scene location, such as a coffee shop or the locker room after gym class; (2) 1+ players to play through a scene with the Kid; (3) a role for the scene partner(s), such as a teacher or another teen.

- Kid, your cover story is that you're from Utah.  However, you know nothing about Utah.  Do what you can with your limited memories and wits and go make friends.

- Play your scene.  Afterward, flip the coin for each card.  If the coin is heads, scrap the card and make one with new memories.

- Play more scenes until you're done.

# Hegemon
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Despotism, Imperialism !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Players are DESPOTS of their own empire. DESPOTS have three ATTRIBUTES: ECONOMY, MILITARY, ESPIONAGE.

===== Setup =====
How did you rise to power? Assign values of 2, 1, and 0 to your ATTRIBUTES, in any order.
Why do you fear the DESPOT to your right? Assign +1 to one of their ATTRIBUTES.
Why do you envy the DESPOT to your left? Assign +1 to one of their ATTRIBUTES.

===== Start of ROUND =====
Gain INFLUENCE = 7 + total ATTRIBUTES.

Each player creates a NATION with RESISTANCE = d6. Describe geopolitical significance and ATTRIBUTE needed to subjugate.

NATION(s) with highest RESISTANCE are INDEPENDENT.

Secretly bid INFLUENCE to subjugate each remaining non-INDEPENDENT NATION in order from least to greatest RESISTANCE (randomly resolve ties).
    STRENGTH = ATTRIBUTE + INFLUENCE bid + d6
Highest STRENGTH that exceeds RESISTANCE subjugates NATION and gains +1 to that ATTRIBUTE. If tied or no bid exceeds RESISTANCE, NATION becomes INDEPENDENT. Bid INFLUENCE is always spent.

Diplomacy is encouraged but never binding.

After all subjugation is resolved, roll d6 and spend that much INFLUENCE or citizens REVOLT: set one ATTRIBUTE of your choice to 0, permanently. Any other DESPOT may spend 3 INFLUENCE, describe meddling, and choose the ATTRIBUTE for you.

Repeat ROUNDs until megalomania is satisfied.

# Man is the Warmest Place to Hide
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: depersonalization, death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are a group of researchers in an isolated base. One of you is a Thing from outer space, hiding in the warm cocoon of a former friend. Draw lots to determine who. Keep your lot a secret.

Separate into pairs, and set a timer for five minutes. In those pairs, play out a scene set somewhere in the base, between yourself and another researcher. What role do you serve in the base? What do you do to relax? Do you know you are a Thing, and do you hunger for something more than your rations, something you cannot understand? 

Switch pairs every five minutes.

When the Thing grows restless, they may assimilate another player by shaking their hand. That player may go on to assimilate more people. If you do not wish to assimilate anyone, you may remain alone.

When any researcher (Thing or not) suspects another of being a Thing, they may shoot them with a finger-gun gesture, and remove that player from the game. The dead are not obligated to reveal if they were a Thing.

The game is over when all researchers are no longer themselves, or when only one survivor remains.

# All Systems Critical

 
```
Alarms wail. Red lights flash. Your cockpit fills with smoke. You combined into a giant robot, but it wasn't enough - the enemy's winning. You can make one last push.


Shuffle a deck of cards. Everyone draws a card.

You're a...

Clubs: Bold & reckless...
Diamonds: Logical & cold...
Hearts: Empathetic & protective...
Spades: Fun-loving & careless...

A: Ace.
2-3: Heavy.
4-5: Newbie.
6-7: Scout.
8-9: Techie.
10-J: 2nd-in-command.
Q-K: Leader.

Same role? Redraw.

Name: 


==Present==
Starting with whoever drew the highest number & going clockwise, introduce yourself. What are you doing, thinking, feeling?


==Flashbacks==
Go around again, once for each Flashback. Each person picks a scene partner, then draws. Play the Flashback with your scene partner. Others can join as you go.

*1st Flashback: What happened when your squad first formed?
Red card: You love your scene partner.
Black card: You dislike them.

*2nd Flashback: What happened shortly before this fight?
Red card: You shared a vulnerable moment.
Black card: You had a falling out.


==Conclusion==
Count the drawn cards.
More red: Your squad comes back and wins.
More black: Your squad is defeated.
How does each person influence the outcome?

# Pawprints Never Cross Asphalt

 
```
Name your mice and your clan, and choose tokens.
Roll 5d6 per player onto any sheet of paper, spread out clusters, and pencil each result beneath its die. Remove dice and draw boundaries between. 

1 Safe path
2 Perilous path, 1 extra ENERGY to avoid dangers
3 Food Source, gain 2 ENERGY 
4 Water, gain 1 ENERGY
5 Shelter, end day here to gain 1 ENERGY 
6 Impassable human development

Begin anywhere with 8 ENERGY. Number days starting at 1. Days end when all mice are in shelter.
Moving costs 1 ENERGY. Food spaces can't be shared, or gathered two days in a row. Shelter is 1 ENERGY more effective if shared, but fouls if used three nights running or if a mouse stays in all day.
Name each area when first encountered - think mouse thoughts.
On days ending in 5, reroll 1s and 2s, replacing number in matching area with new result.
On days ending in 9, reroll 4s and HALF of 6s.
On days ending in 0, reroll 3s and 5s. Foul Shelters clear.
When first revisiting changed areas, rename them.
Game ends on starvation (0 ENERGY), sorrow, or bounteous resources.
