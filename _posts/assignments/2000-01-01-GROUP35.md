# Floating Island

 
```
Gather 3-4 players, then read aloud:

---------------------------

This is a story about a group of very special creatures who once lived on a tiny floating island in the middle of a vast ocean.

We portray these creatures - and this island has been the home of our kin for countless generations.

Even though we are very different from one another we are family - and we love each other.

---------------------------

One player begins by choosing a scene:

[ ] An everyday situation.
[ ] Sharing a good meal.
[ ] Making a furry friend.
[ ] Seeing something spectacular.
[ ] Seeing something on the horizon.
[ ] Signs of an approaching natural disaster.

Set the scene and say who else is there as it happens.

After each scene, cross it off the list - then continue to the next player.

During your scene your character should clearly perform at least one of the following:

* Share a memory or tell story of the past.
* Be kind, loving, or caring.
* Casually adapt to a new situation.
* Enjoy the small things in life.

When the last scene has been crossed off, the story ends. Read aloud:

---------------------------

That was all a very long time ago and the island has long since sunken into the blue.

# DEATH RACE 20XX-500: SURVIVE, THRIVE, DRIVE

 
```
PLAYERS: 2+ | MATERIALS: Paper + Pen(cil)

DEATH RACE 20XX-500 is a game of cooperative survival. Imprisoned in a lethal track with a car and your comrades, you must complete the race while stopping corporate race sponsors from profiting off your televised demise.

BEGIN
Design your car. A car must be able to: MOVE, STOP, and CARRY A DRIVER. Otherwise, it can be anything.

SOCIALIZE
Name your car, then introduce your vehicle/yourself to the other racers. You're each other's greatest hope.

RACE
The DEATH RACE 20XX is 500 miles. An obstacle arises every 50 miles that can destroy whoever passes through.

DESIGNING OBSTACLES
Brainstorm the most dangerous barrier/trick/trap possible. It is now in the way of every driver. Sketch the racetrack and obstacles. Give them names as enjoyable as your car's.

OVERCOMING OBSTACLES
Work with your fellow drivers to figure a way out. If there seems to be no path forward, drivers can automatically pass if one driver sacrifices themself. If that's you, describe your sacrifice and check off the obstacle. 

FINISH
If every driver dies or all obstacles are overcome, the game ends. 

When you reach the end, you're free. How does it feel?

# The Struggle

 
```
Vvvvzzzzwhomp.

You have been materialized on this plane by The Coordinator, to delay The Great Calm.

Your attributes are MIND, BODY, and SOUL, each beginning at 2d6.
Choose something you can do using your best attribute that no one else in the cosmos can do.

Roll 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6 under the relevant attribute to attempt something easy, challenging, or extreme.

You have HP equal to BODY; attacks deal 1d6 damage and always hit.
Roll 2d6 under MIND to act first in a scramble.
When a hit takes you below zero HP, roll 3d6 under SOUL or cease to exist.

You may repurpose a captured artifact from The Calm into a single-use reality spike that guarantees success at a specific activity; decide what that activity is when you construct it.

Whenever you thwart a Lieutenant of The Calm, reduce your best attribute by 1.
Whenever you succumb to temptation, increase your best attribute by 1.

If you succeed in your mission, you cease to exist.
If you fail in your mission, everyone else ceases to exist.

When you cease to exist, make a wish.
Occasionally, wishes are granted.

# Heist Aches

 
```
You're a group of hustlers out to take every penny from a rival's casino.

Create 4 traits describing your character (sexy, brawny, marksman). Write down one useful thing (hacker friend, hidden gun) and keep it secret. When revealed, this Ace in the Hole automatically succeeds one relevant task. Players begin with 5 poker chips and their own deck of cards.

Everyone names one area of the casino with something valuable. GM plans some unknown locations, valuables, and security. Discuss heist plans.

Begin heist. When attempting something, draw a card and play up to five cards. GM draws 1-5 cards, depending on the difficulty, and plays up to five cards. Reveal cards simultaneously. A better poker hand than the GM means success. 

Draw an extra card for each relevant trait. After resolving actions, keep a hand of up to 5 cards. Reshuffle your cards when there are none left to draw, or when you play your entire hand.

If an action fails, lose a chip. If you succeed an action by playing the same number of cards as the GM, gain a chip (maximum of 7). If you lose all your chips, you are caught. They're high stakes, after all.

# The Liminal Hotel Guest Book

 
```
In an empty notebook, write:

To slip into the hotel at the seam of the real, hold this book closed in your hands while you lay down to sleep. Listen for the chatter of the hotel's liminal attendants as they roll precarious push-carts down the hall. When their aether voices ring true in your ears, open the book to see the hotel room that they have made for you, cluttered with objects bizarre and mundane.

If this is your first time holding this guest book, write down three things you see, feel, and hear. If this is a return visit, notice that your room is different now. Write what things the attendants have taken from your room, and what new things are here, perhaps visiting from another guest's room.

Some of what you write must be real. 
All of it must be true.

Sign and date your entry however you like. Sleep, and listen to the murmurs of the attendants for truths, material or imagined. When you wake, you'll find yourself returned to your bed.

When you meet the next guest of the hotel (you will know), hand this book to them and tell them to read it alone.

# An Old and Well-Worn Cloak

 
```
You will need 3-5 players, paper, pencil, eraser, and dice.

Draw a simple cloak. From the group, choose a wearer and an illustrator. Everyone else is the chorus.

The illustrator rolls a prompt, and alters the cloak's drawing accordingly. Afterwards, the chorus answers the first question, and the wearer the second. Choose a chorus member to be the next illustrator, and keep going. 

1: ADDITION. 
 - What purpose do the additions serve? 
 - Why were the changes needed? 

2: DAMAGE.
 - How was the cloak damaged?
 - Does this change the cloak's use?

3: WEAR & TEAR.
 - How has the cloak endured strain over time?
 - What stresses have been put upon the cloak?

4: AESTHETICS. 
 - Why was the cloak's appearance altered? 
 - How does the wearer now perceive themselves?

5: RECORD. 
 - Who marked the cloak?
 - Does the wearer know of this record?

6: INHERITANCE. 
 - How did the wearer part from their cloak? 
 - Who is the new wearer?

When INHERITANCE is rolled, the old wearer chooses a new wearer from the chorus, and then becomes the next illustrator. 

After every player has worn the cloak, the game is over. 

Note: this doesn't be played with a cloak. Try a sword, a crown, or a hand.
