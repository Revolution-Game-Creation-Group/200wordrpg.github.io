# Floating Island

 
```
Gather 3-4 players, then read aloud:

---------------------------

This is a story about a group of very special creatures who once lived on a tiny floating island in the middle of a vast ocean.

We portray these creatures - and this island has been the home of our kin for countless generations.

Even though we are very different from one another we are family - and we love each other.

---------------------------

One player begins by choosing a scene:

[ ] An everyday situation.
[ ] Sharing a good meal.
[ ] Making a furry friend.
[ ] Seeing something spectacular.
[ ] Seeing something on the horizon.
[ ] Signs of an approaching natural disaster.

Set the scene and say who else is there as it happens.

After each scene, cross it off the list - then continue to the next player.

During your scene your character should clearly perform at least one of the following:

* Share a memory or tell story of the past.
* Be kind, loving, or caring.
* Casually adapt to a new situation.
* Enjoy the small things in life.

When the last scene has been crossed off, the story ends. Read aloud:

---------------------------

That was all a very long time ago and the island has long since sunken into the blue.

# Alone
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Solitude !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Alone is an immersive, narrative game for either one (solo), or two+ people.

You wake up and everyone is gone. Even the internet, which still exists, seems devoid of people.

You need:
A diary: notebook and pen, digital notepad, or recording app
30+ minutes every day for a week
A private space
Optional: headphones

Spend at least thirty minutes each day without any human company. If your environment is usually filled with human sounds, use headphones and play white noise. Please be aware of your limits and end the game if it affects you too much.

Contemplate these things while you sit in silence for 15-20 minutes. Then take 10-15 minutes to chronicle (write, speak, or draw) about it in your diary.
Day 1: The first person you noticed missing
Day 2: The first house (other than your own) you checked
Day 3: The first social media platform you checked
Day 4: The first public building you checked
Day 5: Who you miss the most
Day 6: How you fill your days now 
Day 7: You found another person! Exchange diaries (you can do this online). If a solo game: Describe finding signs of another person

# Wholesome Bug Date
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Bugs, Violence, Violence on a Date !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are two nervous bugs on a date! 

Before!
Plan a nice day inside together - cooking a meal, reading on the couch, watching a movie, etc.
Get one pool noodle, boffer weapon, or something that doesn't hurt much to get devastated by. Decide which bug gets the weapon. For politeness, male bugs offer up the weapon first. Agree where it's okay to strike the Unarmed Bug.
Bugs introduce one another by stating something they find pleasant or alluring about the other bug. Use bug words like carapace, mandibles, or make up new bug terms.

Play!
Start your date by physically doing the activity planned! Talk about your bug day, your bug lives, or your ideal bug relationship.
Keep the weapon within reach of the Armed Bug. Remind the Unarmed Bug it's nearby. The Unarmed Bug may never touch the weapon.
During the date, the Armed Bug may pick up the weapon and strike the Unarmed Bug. If struck, they are now dead and may no longer participate in the date's activities. The Armed Bug may continue the date alone until they wish to end the date.
The Unarmed Bug may flee the date at any time, ending the date.

# Bot's First Words

 
```
One of you is a human who has built a robot and wants to teach it to speak. The other is the robot, who just wants to make their parent happy. You will need 8 coins.

Robot only:
// n is the number of coins in front of you
n = 4
// You can only repeat what other people say. When you repeat what your parent says, flip the coins and arrange the flips in a line. Read the flips like binary; coins represent 0 or 1 (tails or heads).
// 0000 == 0
// 0001 == 1
// 0010 == 2
// 0011 == 3
// 0100 == 4
// Etc

If result < 2^(n - 1)
stutter and misspeak. 
// If you are frustrated, how do you lash out? Do you think your parent is disappointed in you?

If you think your parent might have spoken in anger,
n = n - 1. 
If you are certain that they saw you succeed and were proud of you,
n = n + 1.

When n == 0, explain how you carry this failure with you. 
// How does it hurt? Do you ever learn to speak?

When n == 8, say something to your parent that you always wanted to but never could.
// How will you use the speech you've learned?

# The Gentlemen's Discourse

 
```
Each player takes two red tokens and three blue tokens. 

Starting with the oldest player, they will choose another player to challenge to a battle of "wits." 

The Challenger is trying to defame the Defender, who is trying to protect his honor. 

The Challenger starts by making an outlandish and scandalous claim; for example, "I saw you at the party coveting the Queen!"

The Defender will try to rebuke that statement by creating an equally outlandish alibi; for example, "I would never! It was a masquerade!" 

The Challenger gets a final chance to try and defame their opponent. "That's how I know it was you, you weren't wearing a mask!

Other players may interject with added details by spending one of their blue coins; for example, "Yes, I remember you drank yourself silly before meeting her."

At the end of the round, the other players will vote on if the challenger or the defender had the most compelling argument. 

Whoever is right wins the other person's token. 

The game ends when only one player remains with red tokens; The Master of Gentlemen Discourse!

# Getting Better

[Two players.]

INPATIENT, here is what you know:
* Your mind is a wound, grievous and profane.
* You must become a tourniquet.

HOSPITAL, when INPATIENT approaches an Inquisitor (psychiatrist, orderly, or otherwise) for help with their symptoms, portray the Inquisitor and its lair: gleeful, mazelike, ceremonious, gnashing, weeping, spine-laden, phantasmagoric, booooorrred!!, or otherwise.

Have it prescribe a treatment:
* "Spin your afflictions into finery."
* "Arrange your brain meat like a pretty bouquet."
* "Swallow the worm of absolution at the meds window in plain view."
* "Swap neuroses with a fellow patient."
* "Grind a prickly memory to powder, then blow."
* "Just exercise! ...in the Maceration Chamber, of course."

INPATIENT, describe how you obey the prescription and flip a coin.
* Heads: The treatment nearly maims you, but somehow you make it useful. How?
* Tails: It maims you, but you learn to love something about your mind. What?

Your symptoms manifest daily. Seek help from Inquisitors.

HOSPITAL, once INPATIENT has obeyed five prescriptions, say their insurance coverage has expired and depict the Discharge Process.

INPATIENT, you come home to your dingy flat in throbbing Ten-Temper Town, to all your adoring cats. Feed them. Hold them.

Are you a tourniquet yet? What do you want to be?

# Past Your Bedtime

 
```
Dedicated to my daughter.




Two players, Parent and Child, will tell a bedtime to help the Child fall asleep. The Child has mechanics to interrupt and take over the story telling. Both players win if they tell a nice story together.

The Child divides 10 points between the following stats: pragmatism, imagination, adventure, and safety. Sleepy and Awake attributes start at zero.

The Child decides the setting and the Parent begins the story by introducing the main character. If the Parent hesitates or becomes repetitive (or for any reason at all) the Child may interrupt by moving one attribute point into Sleepy. The Child takes the story for a short time, their narration should match the attribute used. The Child may change the story in any way, including changing any previously established facts; the Parent just has to roll with it. 

If the story gets too scary, exciting or boring: increase Awake and decrease Sleepy by 1 (but not below zero.)

If Awake reaches four, the Child is too rambunctious for bedtime. When Sleepy is six, the Child falls asleep, the adult should briefly finish the story to themselves, with an ending inspired by watching their beloved child sleeping peacefully.
