1703 AD, a group of ronin (masterless samurai) seek to avenge their Daymaio by assassinating the Suke (imperial official) that caused the disgrace of their clan.
Tonight, defying Shogun orders, they assault the Suke's fortified residence.
Narrate flashbacks of byzantine preparations.

The residence (depicted below) has 4 posts with #PCs guards each.
Stone walls (= & ||) force a spiralized path to the house.

PCs and NPCs have 10 HP and can perform two actions per round:
- move up to 2 steps;
- attack an adjacent foe, dealing d10 damage.

A PC can take a Dishonor Point (DP) to choose the result of a dice rolled by or against him.
A PC choosing to betray the party, discards all his DPs and prevents everybody from taking any more while alive.
The "traitor" can consume a DP from a loyal "samurai" to reroll a dice rolled by or against him.

If the "samurais" are defeated, the "traitor" gains a position under the Suke's command.
If the guards (and "traitor") are defeated, the Suke is captured and vengance fulfilled.

The Shogun, recognizing their loyalty, may grant the "samurais" the honour of sepuku (ritual suicide), finally cleaning their family name.

#### 3+ players, d6(*) and coins ####

 ---###---

You're a...
*Neurotic...	        *Scientist...
*Thickly-Accented...	*Engineer...
*Belligerent...	       	*Pilot...
*Superstitious...	*Passenger...
*Cowardly ...   	*Linguist...
*Robot...	        *Medic...

...on a rocket-ship exploring uncharted-space.

Secretly you're...
*...terminally-ill.
*...engaged.
*...3-days from retirement.
*...expecting a baby.
*...the rocket-company owner.
*...a spy! (Improvise!)

 ---###---

Introduce your character; role-play radio-chatter. After a few minutes take-turns flipping a coin.

On the third 'tails', the rocket violently explodes because of a...
*...core-meltdown!
*...robot mutiny!
*...computer-malfunction!
*...cosmic-storm!
*...space-squid!
*...tear in space-time!

Suddenly you're all blasted into deep-space! You hear panicking-survivors on your radio. One life-pod pings on your suit-instruments...

 ---###---

Center the life-pod (biggest coin) between the players; everyone places a space-suit (coin) on their table-edge.

Take-turns flicking your space-suit across the table to reach the life-pod and avoid or kill other survivors. Role-play your radio-chatter. 

Remember there's only one seat! 

 ---###---

If your space-suit:
-falls off the table, you're lost-in-space but can still curse the others via radio!
-stops within coin-width of the life-pod you grab-on.
-stops within coin-width of another space-suit, push-away (flick again) or you...
*...burn alive from a fuel-leak! 
*...both die from the impact!
*...struggle but escape!
*...just miss each-other!
*...smash their helmet!
*...fry them with your ray-gun!

# A Deranged Astronauts Last Flight
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: death, suicidal, space !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A GM describes a space ship that is on it's way to doom in the next 30 minutes. Could be a core meltdown or O2-system breaking down.

Each player comes up with 2 bizzare or otherwise difficult to achieve achievements or feats that a soon to be astronaut might want to do before death. Write the feats on paper slips and mix them. Give each player one slip at random.

Players try to achieve the thing described on the paper. For more hilarity, make 2 types of achievements. "Easy" and "Difficult". While Easy might be to "punch another player" the difficult ones might be "Throw another player to jump out of an airlock".

Each player rolls personality at random. 1D6
Even numbers = Negative (narcisstic/sadistic)
Odd numbers = Positive (helpful/cooperative)

Depending on the personality the players might help or hinder the other players plans.

When GM describes obstacles and hardships: Roll 2d6
2-6 = Pure fail
7-10 = Success with a setback
11-12 = Pure success

The ship will be destroyed in 30 minutes. You can use a real time clock or a GM-timed "in game clock" to measure time.

# Rise and Fall of Civilisations

 
```
In this game, three players narrate the rise and fall of a civilisation.

Phase 1 - Creation:

Each player in turn defines one starting characteristic of their initial tribe: physical environment (climate, presence of resources...), origin story (real or mythological) and relation to others (isolated, surrounded by enemies...).


Phase 2 - Rise:

This phase lasts up to 10 rounds, with three roles rotating each round, describing the following:
	1) A major event affecting the whole civilisation (plague, invasion, scientific discovery...)
	2) The immediate reaction and impact from this event by the population
	3) The slow aftermath over the following century, as the civilisation adapts

Each round covers a 100 years in total, and must take into account (and possibly build on) the consequences of all previous rounds. Players are free to discuss the evolution of society and collective psychology in as much depth as they may find interesting.


Phase 3 - Fall:

If the civilisation is still standing at this point, each player then must describe a way in which it brings about its own downfall. All three scenarios then happen at once in an era-ending moment; it is up to the players to decide what legacy if any may be left behind.

# Who the hell dun it?
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Murder, possibly gorey !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
For 4+ players.

~~~~~~~~~

You're invited to a party, but the host is nowhere to be seen. A blood-curdling scream rings out, and you all rush over to find the corpse of the host in this very room. Their death seems recent, meaning the killer is someone in this building, hidden among you.....

~~~~~~~~~

Players choose 1 person to be the ghost of the victim.

Come up with your character's backstory (who's the victim to you, do you know other characters, what's your job, etc.)

Ghost of the victim tells players how they died (bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, etc.)

Living players flip a coin secretly to determine if they're innocent (heads) or guilty (tails). Only the ghost sees the results.

~~~~~~~~~

Players look around the room, using objects or items around other players to accuse them of the murder. Everyone makes accusations, then votes who to accuse, and the ghost kills the accused. If there are still killers alive, the ghost gives a vague hint about the killer (perhaps in how they killed the accused), and the process repeats.

The game ends when all the killers are killed, and the ghost is at peace, or all innocents are killed, and the killers get away.
