1703 AD, a group of ronin (masterless samurai) seek to avenge their Daymaio by assassinating the Suke (imperial official) that caused the disgrace of their clan.
Tonight, defying Shogun orders, they assault the Suke's fortified residence.
Narrate flashbacks of byzantine preparations.

The residence (depicted below) has 4 posts with #PCs guards each.
Stone walls (= & ||) force a spiralized path to the house.

PCs and NPCs have 10 HP and can perform two actions per round:
- move up to 2 steps;
- attack an adjacent foe, dealing d10 damage.

A PC can take a Dishonor Point (DP) to choose the result of a dice rolled by or against him.
A PC choosing to betray the party, discards all his DPs and prevents everybody from taking any more while alive.
The "traitor" can consume a DP from a loyal "samurai" to reroll a dice rolled by or against him.

If the "samurais" are defeated, the "traitor" gains a position under the Suke's command.
If the guards (and "traitor") are defeated, the Suke is captured and vengance fulfilled.

The Shogun, recognizing their loyalty, may grant the "samurais" the honour of sepuku (ritual suicide), finally cleaning their family name.

# Treecrets

 
```
With a friend walk in a park or wooded area until you find a tree that calls out to you both.

Both approach the tree close your eyes and place a hand on it.

Feel the bark. Listen to its leaves. Let the tree tell you its stories.

Let the tree tell you how it got where it is and what events it has seen. Let the tree tell you about the people it has known and the creatures that lived in it. Let the tree tell you how the land has changed around it. Let the tree tell you what it thinks the future will hold.

Take turns sharing the stories the tree has told you with each other.

When the tree has told its story ask it for a message to pass onto another tree.

Ask the tree for a secret only for you.

Do not share this secret, it is a bond between you and the tree.

Open your eyes and thank the tree.

Walk until you find another tree that wants to hear the message you were given.

Touch that tree and deliver the message.

Let that tree tell you its story. 

Hear its secret...

# Vanquish

 
```
* 3-5 players.
* Playing cards.

------------------------------

The Behemoth has laid waste to the world. All will soon be lost - unless you can vanquish the beast.

------------------------------

Decide on a setting.

You sit together, the calm before the storm. Share stories - one per player and topic:

* The Behemoth.
* Something lost.
* Something you can still save.
* A shared experience.
* The future you hope for.

Keep your stories short, but don't fear silence.

Draw a card after each story you tell - for your eyes only. When you have five cards each, you go to face The Behemoth together. 

Draw two cards from the deck. Total them - this is the ADVERSITY. Jacks = 11, Queens = 12, Kings = 13, Aces = 14. 

To STRIKE, overcome the ADVERSITY with your cards. Someone picks a card from their hand and puts it face up. The suit determines your manner - describe your attempt.

HEARTS       Courage
SPADES       Power
DIAMONDS     Wisdom
CLUBS        Luck

Anyone can add more cards. Describe how each card contributes to the STRIKE. If you cannot overcome the ADVERSITY, someone SACRIFICES themselves to STRIKE. Describe how.

After a STRIKE, discard used cards. Draw another ADVERSITY. 

To vanquish The Behemoth, perform one STRIKE more than there are players. Otherwise, you have failed.

# Moments After - The Storytelling RPG

 
```
                    You can't believe it happened. It changed your lives forever.

                              How will you recover?

                              How will you get through this?

                              How will you survive the Moments After?


What's needed:
3+ players that enjoy drama
5-10 minutes per round


Start by introducing the group the story is about:

Each player adds either a positive or negative characteristic to the group. The number of each must be close to equal. Repeat as desired.

"Life was good; Perhaps they were happy... Until something happened...



Step 1: One player gives a word to describe a life-changing event. Each player then adds another descriptor.

Step 2: One player describes how the group reacts to this event, adding dramatic details as desired.

Step 3: All players then hold their hands out and make either a fist or thumbs up. 

If there were more thumbs up, everyone adds a positive detail to the described narrative.
If there were more fists, everyone adds a dramatic detail instead.
If more than one fist was thrown, those players that threw fists add a dramatic detail instead of a positive one.



Repeat the steps until everyone gets a turn on Step 2.

Lastly, have fun!

# Fall from Grace
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence, killing !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```


Your Grace score begins at 9. To do anything, Roll a d10. If it's Social, ROLL UNDER to succeed; if it's Violent, ROLL OVER. Killing someone permanently lowers your Grace by 1, changing the target numbers for all future rolls. If you ever reach 0 Grace, you die and your story ends. You can no longer accomplish any goals, but you may narrate an epilogue to contextualize your death. 

Before each roll, state your Goal and whether you're approaching it Socially or Violently; the GM offers available actions toward that goal within that approach. 
Player: "I want this guy to back off..."
"...using Violence."
GM: "He's kind of a pushover; you only need to rough him up."
"...using Social."
GM: "Because he's honest, bribes won't work. Lies or threats are fair game."

Narrative advantages let you roll additional dice (1 for each narrative element, max 3). Social elements may include bribes or calling in favors. Violent elements can include weapons or advantageous terrain. 

If you tie your Grace score in a social situation, you can kill someone who isn't an immediate threat to you (no roll) to achieve your Goal despite failing. (You still pay the Grace cost.)

# Only One Mosquito

 
```
A super-genius destroyed every mosquito. Except one. The sole mosquito is equal to the combined mass of all eradicated mosquitoes. It's gargantuan. 

In this game, a small team of historic Figures(players) will gather to defend a major city from the Bug, with narration from the GM. Use a d6. A 6 is a success. Actions in-line with character succeed on 5+, and especially hilarious or awesome actions succeed on a 4+. 1's are critical failures. To kill the bug, all players must succeed.
Pre-game: Each player announces the historic figure they wish to play. The players and GM will decide on a city. Lord Byron, Sam Adams, Jimi Hendrix in Shanghai? Awesome. 
Phase 1: In turn, in character, each player will describe why their Figure is in this town, and what they are currently doing. Subsequent rounds are encouraged for Figure integration. 
2: The Mosquito attacks, narrated by GM. The players describe how they survive
3: In turn, in character, each player announces a plan to kill the bug.
4: Test/Execution, narrated by GM, with a twist. Is the bug somehow immune to one plan? The super-genius arrives!? 
5: Plan adjustment(players) and final showdown (GM).

# Magnum Opus

 
```
Requires:
Minor Arcana. 
Three coins per Alchemist.
D6s

One player is the King, the rest are Alchemists. Each alchemist seeks to gain the King's favor so that they can create their Magnum Opus.

The Alchemists must first choose their goal.

Power- Swords 
Health- Cups 
Knowledge- Wands 
Wealth- Coins 

Every great work has four stages. Each stage:

Each Alchemist presents the next stage of their work to the King.

Then, the other Alchemists may offer their objections. After all objections, the speaker may respond. 

Once all Alchemists have presented, the King distributes the coins based on his relative trust in each project. The Alchemists then draw a card for every coin.

After the fourth stage, the Alchemists reveal their cards that match their goal suit. Next, the Alchemists take turns attempting to debunk their opponents. 

An Alchemist may spend one of their remaining cards to explain why one of their opponent's creations doesn't work. If the King is swayed, the Alchemist may remove one of that opponent's cards. 

When no Alchemist has cards to spend, each Alchemist adds up the point values of their revealed cards.  Whichever Alchemist ends with the highest number of points has created their Magnum Opus.
