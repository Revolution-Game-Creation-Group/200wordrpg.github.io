# Balam

 
```
Played at midnight inside a house by candlelight only. All players roll 1D6. Lowest player's spirit has been separated from their body by the demon Balam. They must lay on the floor, lifeless. Remaining players must cover the body with items from the house (sheet, blanket, etc.) so the spirit-player can "take shape" and play (blindly).
Players roam from room to room investigating, trying to find items-jackets, mugs, photos-that are only black and white. These are items left by Balam. All players create Balam's narrative (why it is here, why it chose the afflicted player) using the found items as prompts. Player who found item rolls: 1D6 = 1. their spirit is also abducted 2. is paralyzed for five minutes 3. cannot speak for five minutes 4. must hug another player for five minutes 5. Balam makes one player stomp on the floor six times 6. next item can have one color.
The afflicted player(s) must carry all items. Afflicted player(s) spirit(s) returns to their body when three D5 or D6 items are found. If all players' spirits are abducted, the game (and they) are lost.

# And Then We Were No More
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death of a people !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Let's tell the story of how our world ended. 

This game unfolds as a series of scenes played in reverse chronological order. 

= What You Need =

* 2-6 players
* Index cards
* Writing implements

= Starting =

Write "and then we were no more" on an index card. That is scene zero. The first player sets scene one, which is set just before scene zero, and each subsequent scene is set before the last.

= Your Turn =

Write on a blank index card:
* The new scene number
* A question the scene will answer
* Names of characters present

Write any other important details on additional cards. Each player chooses a character to play, and freeform roleplay begins.

__Every character must die in their first scene.__
Note that since scenes progress backward through time, characters may reappear in subsequent scenes.

When all new characters have died and the scene's question has been answered, the scene ends. Write the question's answer on the scene card, and begin the next player's turn.

= Ending =

Instead of their turn, any player may end the game (and begin the chronology) by writing "This is how our world ended" as the final card. 

Finally, read through the cards in chronological order.

# Paragraphs & Pommels

 
```

The GM is known as the Hero, and the PCs are known as the Weapons. The Hero can only bring one Weapon into the dungeon.

Before you begin coercing the Hero, each Weapon must roll a D6 to determine how much time they have to convince why they should be used. Each Weapon rolls and multiplies the result by 10. This gives them a time limit in seconds. 

After you have selected which Weapon you are, you must convince the Hero why you should be chosen. Each Weapon has a restriction, and a number of seconds on the clock. If you mess up, keep going! After everyone has gone, the Hero chooses who to take. They win! 

Weapons

Sword: Communicate only through gestures. 

Warhammer: Make intense eye contact, unblinking. 

Bow: Speak from outside the room or very far away.

Mace: Only speak in verbs. 

Dagger: Whisper very quietly. 

Spellbook: Spell out every single word. 

Axe: Shout everything in one breath. 

Nunchuck: Repeat every word twice. 

Rapier: Only speak in Adjectives.

Shield: Speak very defensively. 

Spiked Boots: Kick the air with every word. 

Ancient Weapon: Speak in an imaginary language.

# Open Office Floor Plan

 
```
3-5 Workers and 1 Boss

Workers:

Aspects - Name; Education; Job Title; Personality Quirk.

Stats - Productivity 5/Sanity 4 or the reverse. Zero Boss Points

Pick two other players that owe you a Favor. You can call in a Favor to roll at advantage (roll twice, pick the lowest).

You can offer help at any time so the player rolls at advantage. They now owe you a Favor.

Boss:

Choose projects for the workers to cooperate on. Make sure only one person ever gets credit for the work. Assign project roles that don't match Education or Job Title. Give out Boss Points as they complete work. First worker to 10 points gets promoted.

Resolution - Only call for a roll if there's an interesting chance of failure. Player rolls 1d8 against either productivity or sanity (your choice). If the die roll is equal to or lower than the stat, they succeed. They describe how. Then, they increase the stat used by one and decrease the other by one. On a failed roll, complicate their life.

If they reach 1 Sanity, they have a mental breakdown. If they reach 1 Productivity, they're immediately fired. In both cases, player describes how.

# Party's Past

 
```
Party's Past is an introductory campaign mini-game. The game has 3 phases of play - CHARACTER, QUESTIONS, ANSWERS.

CHARACTER
Each player creates their character by picking five words that describe their character. 

Alternatively, players may create their character using an RPG of their choice.

These characters make up the Party.

QUESTIONS
Next, players will create questions for the party. First, roll a d8 to determine the Audience that will be asking the characters questions.

Audience Table
1 - Kids playing in the street
2 - Wizard undergraduates
3 - Soldiers in training
4 - A beginning adventuring party
5 - Snide adolescents
6 - Clerics just sworn to an order
7 - Old-timers at a bar
8 - Player's choice

From the perspective of the Audience, each player writes up to 3 questions on notecards. Shuffle the questions into a pile face down.

ANSWERS
Now, each player will be roleplaying from their character's perspective.

A random character reveals the first question. In turn, characters may do one of the following:

-Answer a revealed question on a new notecard
-Add detail to a previously answered question
-Reveal a new question to answer

When all questions have been answered, a unique, shared past will have been created for the Party!

# Three wishes

 
```
Player 1 "Eretic" : you are a condemned waiting for execution. 

Pick a historical or fictional background and describe yourself and the scene. 

Player 2 "Demon": you are a demon of sorts. 

Appear to Player 1 and offer to grant 3 wishes. You are going to have fun with that. 

Roleplay the scene.

Player 1: write 3 wishes, using 6 or less words for each wish.

3 WISHES RULE (is known to Player 1 before they write):

1 wish will be granted and narrated by the Demon starting with: YES, AND... 

1 wish will be granted and narrated by the Demon starting with: YES, BUT...

1 wish will be granted and narrated by the Demon starting with: WELL, ALMOST, BUT NOT REALLY, BECAUSE...

Then Player 1: narrate a conclusion and call the demon to grant a Last Wish. 

Write the Last Wish down using 9 or less words. 

LAST WISH RULE (is known to Player 1 before they write):

The demon will turn 1 word of the Last Wish in that word's opposite. 

Then she (grinningly) grants it. 

Roleplay the end.

(Does that word have an opposite? Is that the real opposite? If there's a discussion, it's part of the game.)

# Confused Detectives

 
```
A mystery for 3+ players.  You need pens, paper, index cards

You've come together to solve a mystery.  Together determine who/what/where you are (hard boiled gumshoes, a Japanese Attorney and crew, military investigators...).  
After, figure out what crime you are investigating (murder, theft, missing person...).  
Individually, take 6 index cards and fill out the following:
   2x Clue/evidence - Fingerprints, a scrap of paper with something written
   2x Witness - A neighbor
   2X Suspect - An estranged spouse, an angry business partner, a rival
   2x Motive - An upcoming contest, an inheritance

After everyone has filled out their cards shuffle them all together.  

Play begins and one player draws a card and interprets the scene.  Everything they provide about the card is true but not necessarily relevant to the investigation.  Play the scene with the other players asking questions, interrogating, or otherwise exploring the information.  When satisfied, the next player draws a card and they frame the next scene.  Play continues until everyone has had two chances to frame scenes.  After the final card scene the detective team determines how they think the crime occurred, motives, perpetrators.  Did you solve the crime?  What are the results?
