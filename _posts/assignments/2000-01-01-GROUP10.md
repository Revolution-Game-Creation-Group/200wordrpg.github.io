# Balam

 
```
Played at midnight inside a house by candlelight only. All players roll 1D6. Lowest player's spirit has been separated from their body by the demon Balam. They must lay on the floor, lifeless. Remaining players must cover the body with items from the house (sheet, blanket, etc.) so the spirit-player can "take shape" and play (blindly).
Players roam from room to room investigating, trying to find items-jackets, mugs, photos-that are only black and white. These are items left by Balam. All players create Balam's narrative (why it is here, why it chose the afflicted player) using the found items as prompts. Player who found item rolls: 1D6 = 1. their spirit is also abducted 2. is paralyzed for five minutes 3. cannot speak for five minutes 4. must hug another player for five minutes 5. Balam makes one player stomp on the floor six times 6. next item can have one color.
The afflicted player(s) must carry all items. Afflicted player(s) spirit(s) returns to their body when three D5 or D6 items are found. If all players' spirits are abducted, the game (and they) are lost.

# Simple Explorers

 
```
You are an Explorer. As such, you have a NAME, a ROLE, GOALS, and three stats. 

BODY is physical; climbing, hitting, withstanding hits.

SENSES are accuracy, perception, dexterity.

MIND is knowledge, discernment, magical prowess.

Start with two in each, and add four points between them. Whenever you test your skills, divide your stat in half (rounded down) and roll that many d6. Rolls of 4+ are one success each. One success means it works, but only just, and something goes very wrong. Two successes means it works with minor difficulties. Three successes means it works perfectly. For every roll that ends in no successes, mark one exp. Spend three exp to increase a stat by one.

To help an ally, roll the stat they do. For each of your successes, they roll +1d6.

ROLES and GOALS:
Choose a ROLE for yourself; this is who a
you are and what you do. Some examples include: "Boxer", "Hacker", and "Mage"

Also choose a GOAL for yourself; why you wanted to Explore. Some examples include: "Help People", "Prove Myself", and "Make My Fortune".

That's it! You can use this system for any setting, just fit the ROLES and GOALS to your game!

# Fantasy First

 
```
YOU NEED: 
1d6, at least 1 Player, you as Game Master

INIT:
Create(if you can) or remember a story with genre, that Players like. It can be a movie, a game, poem or just a short novell. Don't care about every detail, just be sure you can tell a basic plot

INTRO:
Choose suitable characters for Players. Tell Players about story world, epoch, region and their characters. Based on story, you tell just "you woke up at dark room", or give detailed description about character childhood. Don't create too detailed rules - game mostly about fantasy - give as much freedom as possible

GAME:
Story - pack of choices characters make. Every time Player needs to make a choice - ask him to roll a dice. Prepare to create a story reaction on that:

1 - bad decision with consequences
2 - bad choice, minor problems
3 - fail
4 - success
5 - success, small benefit
6 - great choice, good reward!

RULES:
none/any 
(Players decide what to do, you decide when they roll)

OUTRO:
Perhaps, it's a story without begin and end, but better create a final goal. F.e. survive for an hour in the world of Lovecraft or take control at Death Star

# Words Over the Airwaves
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Gameplay could potentially induce anxiety. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Dice are six-sided, rolled secretly. GMless.

== Setup ==

Each player roleplays an isolated scientist studying an inhospitable planet. They can't reach each other physically, just by satellite radio.

As a group, describe and draw out the planet and each scientist's base, including equipment and environs.

Then, a random player rolls one die for a prompt:

 1 = Base equipment failure
 2 = Imminent hazard
 3 = Pest infestation
 4 = Mysterious issues
 5 = Serious illness
 6 = Natural disaster

...invents from that their scientist's emergency, announces a timescale (example: 6:1 gametime:realtime), and alerts the others in-character.

== Play ==

During play, only interact through in-character text (group chat, social media, email, whatever). Do not announce your temporary AFKs.

Characters discuss the situation and may attempt tasks thus:

- Estimate difficulty:
 0 = trivial (no roll)
 3 = normal
 6 = risky
 9 = only theoretically possible

- Roll two dice. Succeed if either meets or exceeds difficulty.

- If dice were equal, communications interruption: roll and add for realtime minutes player must stay silent before reporting what happened.

Characters may attempt tasks to assist upcoming tasks. (Example: "I'll build a copy and test-run their machine here.") Each success lowers the final difficulty by three.

End when the emergency is resolved, however it resolves.

# Crimson
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: blood, inhumanity !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>

Crimson
by Jeeyon Shim

Crimson is a solitaire game. Duration of play is silent. Do not let yourself be seen by anyone during any stage of play, especially the endgame.

Play it when you bleed accidentally (e.g. a paper cut).




You are a homunculus. You have been in the world for a week and a day. The magician who created you died yesterday, and your skeleton is still turning from wood to bone, your veins still run with water slowly turning to blood. 



Put a small piece of white gauze on the cut. Watch the blood bloom through the cloth.



The bleeding is a sure sign that you are transforming. 



Put the bloodied gauze in a small brown paper box.



What makes you human? Write it on the outside of the box.



What keeps you from being completely human? Write it on the inside of the box.





Which do you commit to?

HUMAN: If you commit to being human, find a tree and bury the box with your blood in the dirt by its roots.

HOMUNCULUS: If you commit to being inhuman, throw the box with your blood into a fire and watch it as it burns to ash.

# Attrition

 
```
Attrition is a two-player game about clashing forces.
You are on the same team, working together to win.
You need 3 ten-sided dice and 4 index cards to play.

Setup:
Decide the setting and scale of the conflict, from gangs to armies.
Name each side and decide which side you are playing on.

Choose 3 advantages for your side (training, reputation etc.).
Choose 4 obstacles you must overcome (zealotry, chokepoints etc.).
Record these on two index cards.

Each player secretly records their favourite type of plan on an
index card (violent, stealthy etc.). Never reveal this.

Play:
On your turn the other player asks you: "What's the plan?"

Announce which obstacle you are attacking with what advantage. Briefly
narrate your plan.

The other player silently hands you dice:
-one by default
-another if they think it could work
-another if it matches their favourite plan type

Roll.
- On 11+, cross out the obstacle. You overcome it.
- On 10-, cross out your advantage. You lose it.
You narrate the result as the OTHER SIDE in the conflict.
Pass turn.

Endgame:
If all obstacles are gone you win, if all advantages are gone you
lose. Take turns briefly narrating the aftermath.
