# Trivial Matters and a Bomb

 
```
A Dinner Conversation for Seven or Less


This world is

beautiful.

broken.



Ours is also both of those things.

How odd.

Moving on.



Each of you:

Listen.

say something beautiful about this world.

say something broken about this world.

Listen.


Something drastic is going to happen.

First to these people. 

Then to this world.




Each of you:

choose one:

Avail, Devon, Jace, Nari, Soryl, Trill and Wyr 


Another:

how you got here

the unseasonable weather

a new technology

a wager

how different things once were

a natural wonder

a work of art


And one more:

flirt because of desire

flirt in spite of desire

ask after a relative's health

ask after a missing guest

reveal a secret

reveal a fear

question another's past decision




Write your choices down.

Make a name tent.



These characters know of one another

They've never met.


They're:

powerful.

self-centered.

polite.

opinionated. 

and well-informed.



Set a timer.

Place it under the table.

Sit for a meal.



Converse, using your choices if you like.

Fragmenting, 
individual exchanges
are ok. 

Silence
is ok.



When the timer beeps, a bomb has killed all present.

Drastic.


But what happens to the world?

The Cars
Parlor- Things that wasted time and energy.  A soul sucking job or vices.
Coach- The un-lived life all the places you never got to see or things you did not do.
Observatory- The moments or opportunities that passed you by that you regret.

# Vanquish

 
```
* 3-5 players.
* Playing cards.

------------------------------

The Behemoth has laid waste to the world. All will soon be lost - unless you can vanquish the beast.

------------------------------

Decide on a setting.

You sit together, the calm before the storm. Share stories - one per player and topic:

* The Behemoth.
* Something lost.
* Something you can still save.
* A shared experience.
* The future you hope for.

Keep your stories short, but don't fear silence.

Draw a card after each story you tell - for your eyes only. When you have five cards each, you go to face The Behemoth together. 

Draw two cards from the deck. Total them - this is the ADVERSITY. Jacks = 11, Queens = 12, Kings = 13, Aces = 14. 

To STRIKE, overcome the ADVERSITY with your cards. Someone picks a card from their hand and puts it face up. The suit determines your manner - describe your attempt.

HEARTS       Courage
SPADES       Power
DIAMONDS     Wisdom
CLUBS        Luck

Anyone can add more cards. Describe how each card contributes to the STRIKE. If you cannot overcome the ADVERSITY, someone SACRIFICES themselves to STRIKE. Describe how.

After a STRIKE, discard used cards. Draw another ADVERSITY. 

To vanquish The Behemoth, perform one STRIKE more than there are players. Otherwise, you have failed.

# We Are Sorry
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Body horror, cats !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are all a cat. You live in a house with your owner, John. Whenever you declare you'd like to do something, you perform that action unless another player disagrees. All players who are in conflict flip coins. Those who get heads control the actions of the cat. If more than one player gets heads, the cat gruesomely changes to be able to perform both actions simultaneously. The game ends when John can't leave the house.
The narrator controls the house, John, and the consequences of your actions.

You are hungry.

# Chair
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Existential Horror, Being Physically Restrained, Being Ignored !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Quiet terror, for one and onlookers

Instruct onlookers that they should not be worried or disturbed by anything they see. You are playing a game and can stop at any time. They must not intervene.

Collect a chair to sit on. It should be from a different room or place, move it into this new context. It is a stranger to this place.

Once it's moved, sit down. Grip the base of the chair firmly with both hands. Wrap your legs around the legs of the chair. Sit up straight if possible. The chair now has a hold of you. You cannot stand up until the game is over.

Next begin to struggle fruitlessly. The chair is holding you down. The chair won't let go. The chair never listens. The chair must hate you. The chair is a spiteful thing. The chair entangles you ever further. The chair keeps you.

No escape.

No hope.

You may attempt to scream, but no sound comes out. Nothing can offer any help. The onlookers will ignore your pleas. You asked them to. You are playing a game, but you are trapped.

Then, suddenly. You may stand. Do whatever you wish to the chair.

START:
- Introduce yourselves. You're all wizards & witches who've decided to go on a journey. Determine why, macro-level (what is the main objective of this journey?) & micro-level (what's in it for you, specifically?)
- Venture off. Roll a d6 whenever the group's conversations become stale, figure out what event happens based on the table below:

                                          | ROLL |         EVENT         |
                                          |------|-----------------------|
                                          |  1   |         enemy         |
                                          |  2   |         trap          |
                                          |  3   |    traveler (good)    |
                                          |  4   |    traveler (bad)     |
                                          |  5   | traveler (mysterious) |
                                          |  6   |         loot          |

EVENTS:
- When encountering an event, get creative with what it means & what will happen.
- Once your party has determined what exactly is going on, it's time to cast your spells (if need be).
- Each player says what spell they'd like to cast (from table) & why.
- Sleep IRL.
- Wake up, think back to your dreams.
- Consult table below:

                      |     DREAM      |               OUTCOME               |
                      |----------------|-------------------------------------|
                      |   good dream   |         spell-cast success          |
                      |   bad dream    |         spell-cast backfire         |
                      |    no dream    |            no spell-cast            |
                      | very odd dream |        spell-cast confusion!        |
                      |                | (group determines creative outcome) |

- Back at the table, group discusses their dreams & resolves the situation accordingly.
- Rinse & Repeat.

# Incubate

 
```
This game requires:
- 4 players (3 Bearers, 1 Serpent of Death)
- One egg (a real one)

This is the World-Egg. Your sacred lands have been killed by the High Cities of Troke. The World-Egg must hatch to start the Universe anew.

Bearers:

- You must take the World-Egg to the World's End. 
- Stand about a meter away from each other. 
- One of you holds the egg.

Each Bearer chooses a different duty:

SPEAKER
PATHFINDER
PROTECTOR

The Serpent of Death:

- You desire to see the World-Egg shatter.
- Stalk around the circle 
- Conjure up obstacles between Bearers and the End.

Example Obstacles:
-- Citizens of Troke where they disdain belief in the World-Egg,
-- Shadow creatures that use dreams as blades,
-- Twisting landscapes that trick and snare,
-- All else that is evil.

Bearers describe how they overcome obstacles, then must throw the egg to the Bearer with the relevant duty. If that Bearer already has the egg, Bearers must find another approach.

After catching the egg, take a half step back.

If the egg breaks, the Universe dies. 

If Bearers overcome nine obstacles, they have reached the World's End and the World-Egg hatches. All of time and space is reborn. The Serpent hibernates. Rejoice.
