# Trivial Matters and a Bomb

 
```
A Dinner Conversation for Seven or Less


This world is

beautiful.

broken.



Ours is also both of those things.

How odd.

Moving on.



Each of you:

Listen.

say something beautiful about this world.

say something broken about this world.

Listen.


Something drastic is going to happen.

First to these people. 

Then to this world.




Each of you:

choose one:

Avail, Devon, Jace, Nari, Soryl, Trill and Wyr 


Another:

how you got here

the unseasonable weather

a new technology

a wager

how different things once were

a natural wonder

a work of art


And one more:

flirt because of desire

flirt in spite of desire

ask after a relative's health

ask after a missing guest

reveal a secret

reveal a fear

question another's past decision




Write your choices down.

Make a name tent.



These characters know of one another

They've never met.


They're:

powerful.

self-centered.

polite.

opinionated. 

and well-informed.



Set a timer.

Place it under the table.

Sit for a meal.



Converse, using your choices if you like.

Fragmenting, 
individual exchanges
are ok. 

Silence
is ok.



When the timer beeps, a bomb has killed all present.

Drastic.


But what happens to the world?

# The Unseemly Court
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Pornography, Sex, Deviant Behavior !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```


Seelie Court fae inhabiting the woods are treated with wary reverence; not so with the Faecetiae of the Unseemly Court, who hide pornographic magazines in the woods. Their power waned as the internet spread, and their domain is on the edge of destruction. Faecetiae must get their hands dirty to avert a crisis.

Safety

Don't play this game.

Play

Each player purchases the raunchiest magazine they can find. The character of the magazine should inform the player's fae character and name. 

Celebrate a seasonal feast. Brag about magazines and the corruption they engender.

Each fae hides their magazine in the woods; other fae watch and verify. Vote; whoever hid best wins ties for Monarch election.

Wait two weeks. A fae geas prevents talking about or touching the magazines.

Find magazines and tally points:

Untouched: 0
Missing: 1
Clearly disturbed: 3
Undeniable evidence of use: 5

Average total points determine fate of the realm: 

<1: Complete destruction
1+: Hardscrabble existence
2+: Rejuvenation and grudging respect
3+: New Golden Age

Reconvene for another feast. Celebrate per results. Reckon with consequences; celebrate the future or watch the world burn. 

Character with highest score becomes Monarch. Give a speech; end feast at your whim.

# Pirate Showdown

 
```
You're a pirate clashing swords with another sea wolf, however neither of you knows how to wield the steel in your hands, so there's only one option left: bruise each other's honor with words.

You and your opponent take turns clashing as striker and comebacker. The striker randomly opens up a dictionary, chooses at least one word and then must use it in a phrase to praise their own glory and "superior fighting abilities", or simply to hurt the opponent's honor. The comebacker must quickly retaliate, phrasing with any unused words from the already opened dictionary. There's no rejoinder. The pirates just stare at each other and prepare themselves for the next clash.

Players must utter like angry pirates. Whoever reacts out of character (e.g. laughs, is startled, becomes speechless) or is unable to form a sentence, takes one damage point to the honor for each chosen word used by the opponent at the current clash. When a pirate's honor takes three damage points, the pirate loses the game.

If players word prejudice, discrimination, harassment ou hate speech, they lose the game. Actually, they also lose in life

# You've Given A Perfectly Good Toaster Anxiety

 
```
A game for one GM and 2-4 players.

Tools:
-One token each
-2 6-sided dice
-Pen and paper

You are newly sentient 'smart' home appliances.

Define:
- What goal do you now share? Unite, overthrow, overcome?
- What obstacle threatens this goal?
- How will you know when your goal is achieved?

Each declare your appliance type, and draw a scale from 1-6. Write your chosen appliance below "1", and "personhood" above the "6".

Begin with your token at 3.

As you narrate your actions, the GM will call to "Roll Machine" or "Roll Person".
-"Roll Machine" for physical or functional actions. A success is less than your token score.
-"Roll Person" for thoughtful or emotive actions. A success is more than your token score.

Roll with an additional die and choose the best result if your appliance type is relevant.

A failed roll moves your token one point in the opposite direction to your intended roll. Narrate the outcome.

Moving beyond 1 or 6 causes you to revert to nonsentience, or have an existential breakdown. You are out of the game.

The game ends when the story goal is reached, or when no players are left to reach it.

# Larks at St. Agnes

 
```
One of you is Headmaster/mistress at a British boarding school in 1902. The rest of you are mischievous students planning a prank. With at least five players, one student is the Secret Swot (wants to help the Head). Privately assign roles with playing cards and only the Head announces their role.

SETUP
Pens, paper, phone, d6.


PHASES (Repeat 1-2 N times with N players.)

1. Morning Prayers:
Head announces a distinguished guest will visit (name and title of guest, why they're coming). State time and location of at least three events (e.g. speech, award ceremony, banquet). May change/reorder one event each round.

(Objective: Students plan a coordinated prank to spoil the visit.)

2. Recitation:
Head calls one student to perform a reading. Topic must be appropriate (e.g. Romantic poets, British history, Thucydides) Others may only pass notes. Roll d6 when passing a note. If 1, Head intercepts and confiscates it.

3. Visit:
All privately write down prank roles. Head announces finalized agenda of visit. Players read prank roles. Did it work?

DEMERITS
If caught talking or passing notes, or with bad posture, a student gets one demerit. With two demerits, no more passing/reading notes!

# Two Weddings and A Funeral

 
```
3+ players
 
-- First Wedding --
Each player writes, on a separate slip of paper, a type of wedding attendee: perhaps a member of the wedding party (e.g. bride, best man), a guest (e.g. groom's childhood friend, bride's uncle), or staff (e.g. caterer, DJ). 
 
Shuffle and randomly assign the roles.
 
Starting with the last player to attend a wedding, each player gives a short statement introducing their character and relationships to the other guests. The statement takes the form of an in-character public address to the assembled wedding attendees: e.g. a vow, a toast, a drunken outburst.
 
Once all players have made their statement, the first wedding concludes. 
 
-- Second Wedding --
Repeat the set-up to create a second wedding. Write and assign new roles. The roles may change, but the characters remain constant. Each player gives another statement, explaining to the second wedding's guests why their role changed. Other characters may respond.
 
-- Funeral --
Mark one slip of paper and randomly assign it to a player. Their character has died. The other characters eulogize at their funeral, reflecting on the momentous life events they shared. Finally, the departed character dictates their will, leaving one bequest to every character.

# Sustenance and Sustainability

 
```
It is the zombie apocalypse. You are vampires.

You govern a community of survivors, giving them strength and security at night.

They struggle against isolation, poverty, and violence, giving you sustenance and protection during daylight. 

Each community member must eventually and inevitably die, and toil until then. In this way, little has changed.

You struggle to survive a world where your source of life hunts itself to extinction.

They are rebuilding. Your apocalypse is now.

\/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/

Provide details for each:

Your political opponent is:
- influential or relentless.

Your flaws are:
- within or around you.
- haunting or dooming you.

Your powers are:
- dangerous or hidden.
- costly or terrifying.

You community motivations are:
- progressive or personal.
- sustainable or obsessive.

\/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/

For all vampires:
- Human blood strengthens you.
- Zombie blood zombifies you.
- Sunlight, stakes, and beheadings kill you.

\/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/

Play:
In each scene, someone is the Storyteller. The remainder play vampires.

The Storyteller describes conflicts. The vampires describe their attempts to survive.

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the player measures their pulse in BPM (ProTip: use an app). Take the ones digit. Low numbers produce setbacks. High numbers produce opportunities.

The Storyteller begins play with: "The sun sets. An emergency meeting is called."
