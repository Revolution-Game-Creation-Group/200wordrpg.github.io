# Vision Quest
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: N/A !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A domino based two-player cooperative RPG about searching for meaning during a crisis. 

Tools: 
     >Set of dominoes placed face-down with doubles removed. 

Players: 
     >A Character facing a specific crisis
     >The Quest 

The Character draws and blindly places one domino (two at the start) at the end of the line. The Quest describes the scene/transition. The Character describes the action of the scene; how they respond and how the scene resolves. Both should involve their partner, asking them for details.

Narrative Cues: 
     The first side of a domino is the Impact, the second the Path.
     Compare the new impact to the previous Path. 

         Impact =< Path: Scene is pessimistic
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |           | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |    ()    |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |           |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'         
                                    or
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |  ()      | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |    ()    |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |      ()  |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'        

         Impact > Path: Scene is optimistic
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |  ()  ()  | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |           |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |  ()  ()  |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'         

     The difference between the new Impact and Path describes the severity/impact of the scene

     The new Path provides narrative direction:
          One: Isolation, confidence, hope
          Two: Betrayal, companionship, choice
          Three: Linearity, travel, transition
          Four: Stagnation, balance, revolution
          Five: Entrapment, focus, discovery
          Six: Crowding, abundance, unity

     When either the Impact or Path are blank the Character has to declare an epiphany they have had regarding their crisis. If the Character cannot the Quest adds a complication to the original crisis. 

     When the crisis resolves play ends.

# Don't Flip Out At Work!

 
```
One player is the General Manager (GM), and the rest are minimum-wage workers.
Workers have a NAME, a USELESS COLLEGE MAJOR, and a d6 pool (starts at 1d6).
The Manager has a NAME and can fire anyone on the spot.
 
Before you begin play, describe the following about the store:
	> Name
	> What it sells
	> A dreaded loyal customer

Player goals:
	> Keep your job.
	> Make sure all workplace positions are filled.
Player actions:
	> When your job is infuriating, roll your pool.
		> Roll no sixes: You bottle it up. Add 1d6 to your pool.
	 	> Roll a six: You flip out at work!
	> When you take a secret break, remove 1d6 from your pool, and 
	  put it in the middle. During subsequent breaks, workers place 
	  their  break die on top, forming a tower of laziness. 
	> If the tower collapses on your break, the manager catches you 
	  and flips out at work!
	> When the day is over, go home, sleep for five hours, and start 
	  again the next morning. 

Manager goals:
	> Run the game. Switch roles between manager, customers, and 
	  everyone else.
	> Keep the workplace running.
Manager actions: 
	> Introduce an infuriating customer
	> Break something in the store
	> Fire a worker

Your phone starts blaring an alarm... Annnnnd BOOM! You just got an alert saying the world ends in one hour! You have that time, starting right this instant, to gather and prepare food, water, and other supplies.

At the end of that hour, you no longer have conventional electricity, running water, or access to networks/infrastructure. If you have to leave to get more supplies and are not back within that hour, you are presumed dead.

Over the next week, you have to ration those few supplies you saved.

The game ends in one week or when you/all players give up.

"Giving up" signifies death.

You lose if you die before the week is up.

# Weave-Tellings

 
```
Collect a ball of yarn. With three or more people, gather in a circle in a large area. 

Each person gathered is a potential Speaker. The role of a Speaker is to add to the Telling.

All Tellings start with a single problem. There might be a mighty and terrible war between nations, or the strain of jealousy between neighbors in a small community. The first Speaker establishes what the problem is for the Telling.

Once a Telling has a problem, the Speaker must loop the yarn once around their hand and then pass the ball to another person.

Not all gathered may want to add to the Telling. The next Speaker in turn is someone who will describe how a single character in the Telling encounters the problem and how they seek to resolve it. When they are finished, they must loop their hand in the yarn and pass the ball to the next willing Speaker.

A Telling continues as long as there is yarn to spin. Each speaker maintains their threads to the ball as it is passed, and all Speakers describe only a single, new character. A weave grows through the connections between characters and Speakers.

# Moonsick Family
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Food !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Touched by Her Paw, you've grown up in a village, a pack.
Your coming of age was your first hunt; elation, terror, hunger, and *life* as you'd never known before.
Your whole family was there, running beside you.

Then, Hunters came, more every year, scattering your family.

Now, your pack is found-family.

Answer yourself:

- What terrifies you?
- What do you hunger for?
- Why do you risk your life?

Answer together:

- Why do you run together?
- Where are you going?

A large bag of sweet jerky, a small bag of spicy; cut into bite-size pieces; place in a bag.

You've two tracks, Hunger and Moonsick.

Rate challenges 1-3, 3 being hard.

Draw pieces = rating; if any are spicy, fail.

For every packmate who helps, draw one fewer.
Draw fewer pieces by increasing Hunger 1:1.

If Hunger reaches 5, you *must* transform.
Decrease Hunger by eating raw flesh while transformed.

You may transform at will. Lasts for Hunger minutes.
While transformed, succeed in all challenges.
After, increase Moonsick by 1 if voluntary, 3 if not.

If Moonsick reaches 10, you're forever the beast.
Decrease Moonsick by sharing a secret with a packmate.

Each session ends when out of jerky.
