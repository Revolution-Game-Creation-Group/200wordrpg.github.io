# Vision Quest
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: N/A !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A domino based two-player cooperative RPG about searching for meaning during a crisis. 

Tools: 
     >Set of dominoes placed face-down with doubles removed. 

Players: 
     >A Character facing a specific crisis
     >The Quest 

The Character draws and blindly places one domino (two at the start) at the end of the line. The Quest describes the scene/transition. The Character describes the action of the scene; how they respond and how the scene resolves. Both should involve their partner, asking them for details.

Narrative Cues: 
     The first side of a domino is the Impact, the second the Path.
     Compare the new impact to the previous Path. 

         Impact =< Path: Scene is pessimistic
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |           | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |    ()    |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |           |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'         
                                    or
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |  ()      | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |    ()    |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |      ()  |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'        

         Impact > Path: Scene is optimistic
          .----------.---------.        .----------.---------.   
          |  ()  ()  | ()      |        |  ()  ()  | ()      |      
          |  ()  ()  |    ()   |        |           |          |          
          |  ()  ()  |      () |        |  ()  ()  |      () |           
          '-----------'---------'       '-----------'---------'         

     The difference between the new Impact and Path describes the severity/impact of the scene

     The new Path provides narrative direction:
          One: Isolation, confidence, hope
          Two: Betrayal, companionship, choice
          Three: Linearity, travel, transition
          Four: Stagnation, balance, revolution
          Five: Entrapment, focus, discovery
          Six: Crowding, abundance, unity

     When either the Impact or Path are blank the Character has to declare an epiphany they have had regarding their crisis. If the Character cannot the Quest adds a complication to the original crisis. 

     When the crisis resolves play ends.

# Glorious leader is Dead!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, political backstabbing !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Comrade of the Glorious Revolution! The president is dead. Turn on a radio (or song, or podcast, or Video); the next sentence you hear were his/her last words. Each person is a member of the ruling party.

Sequester everyone until you can create a unified front behind a new President. Anyone who enters needs to be sworn to secrecy.

Everyone takes turns declaring their position in the cabinet before the death of the President. Using social media, phones, etc, reach out to people to seek their support for your position as President, but without letting them know that the President is dead. These people are Members of the Glorious Revolution.

If two or more people gain the purported support of the same Member of the Glorious, they each need to make a speech to the remaining members of the cabinet. Everyone in the room then votes to award the support of those Members to one of the people giving a speech.

First person to a majority of at least 10 supporters becomes the new President and gets to decide their cabinet.

# Finding A Thief

 
```
One player is a dwarf. Write your name and the treasure your people lost which you hope to recover.

All other players are halflings. Write your name and your favorite food, the more elaborate the better (keep it secret).

Going around, the dwarf attempts to persuade a halfling to join their quest by addressing them by name and offering them a specific food. Halflings eat the food, thank the dwarf by name, and comment that it "needs more [ingredient from their favorite food]".

When the dwarf offers a halfling exactly their favorite food, they will agree to be a thief for the dwarf. Both win a share of the treasure.

The other halflings win because they got a bunch of free food, and don't have to go on a perilous adventure far from home.

# Pisa D Action

 
```
Do you like rolling tons of dice? Do you build dice towers, waiting for your turn in tabletop RPGs? Do you own a giant sack of dice? What if there was a way to make a game of that? 

In this game, each player is an intrepid explorer, researching the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This tower has many floors, and you discover that each floor is actually a battle arena. Can you fight all the way to the top?

Roll a 'handful of dice' to determine the number of floors. Each floor is a boss fight. 

This game uses dice towers. To determine damage dealt, the player builds a tower made of assorted dice. Once that tower falls, the players collect the dice used and roll those to determine their damage. 

Objective: See how many bosses you can beat. No healing between floors. 
Boss Health: Each player (including GM) builds a dice tower and adds everything together.
Player Health: Some arbitrarily large number.  Like 10,000 + a player-made dice tower.

To save time, build your dice towers at the same time. GM builds one for the boss.

Keep scoreboard for tallest tower and most damage dealt!

Maybe use a tray ... cool.

# Out of Time

 
```
"Only you can save us," an older version of yourself said.  "I didn't, but you can." He handed you a book and a die as he faded away.  Passages were missing from the book, but you could infer your nemesis was erasing your existence; the die would allow you to move through time to stop him from interfering with your temporal selves as they faced critical challenges.

NEED TO KNOW

--Aspects--

Clubs = Physical
Hearts = Social
Diamonds = Spirit
Spades = Mind

8 - Loss
9 - Health
10 - Persistence

Q - Horror
K - Power
A - Control

--Resolution--

6+ = Yes, and gain a Trait with no bonus
4-5 = Yes
3- = No, and -d6 Stability

Traits: +3 bonus once/game.
Traits mitigate harm; -1 from next roll/damage and Trait is lost.

SETUP

# Pawprints Never Cross Asphalt

 
```
Name your mice and your clan, and choose tokens.
Roll 5d6 per player onto any sheet of paper, spread out clusters, and pencil each result beneath its die. Remove dice and draw boundaries between. 

1 Safe path
2 Perilous path, 1 extra ENERGY to avoid dangers
3 Food Source, gain 2 ENERGY 
4 Water, gain 1 ENERGY
5 Shelter, end day here to gain 1 ENERGY 
6 Impassable human development

Begin anywhere with 8 ENERGY. Number days starting at 1. Days end when all mice are in shelter.
Moving costs 1 ENERGY. Food spaces can't be shared, or gathered two days in a row. Shelter is 1 ENERGY more effective if shared, but fouls if used three nights running or if a mouse stays in all day.
Name each area when first encountered - think mouse thoughts.
On days ending in 5, reroll 1s and 2s, replacing number in matching area with new result.
On days ending in 9, reroll 4s and HALF of 6s.
On days ending in 0, reroll 3s and 5s. Foul Shelters clear.
When first revisiting changed areas, rename them.
Game ends on starvation (0 ENERGY), sorrow, or bounteous resources.
