# Don't Flip Out At Work!

 
```
One player is the General Manager (GM), and the rest are minimum-wage workers.
Workers have a NAME, a USELESS COLLEGE MAJOR, and a d6 pool (starts at 1d6).
The Manager has a NAME and can fire anyone on the spot.
 
Before you begin play, describe the following about the store:
	> Name
	> What it sells
	> A dreaded loyal customer

Player goals:
	> Keep your job.
	> Make sure all workplace positions are filled.
Player actions:
	> When your job is infuriating, roll your pool.
		> Roll no sixes: You bottle it up. Add 1d6 to your pool.
	 	> Roll a six: You flip out at work!
	> When you take a secret break, remove 1d6 from your pool, and 
	  put it in the middle. During subsequent breaks, workers place 
	  their  break die on top, forming a tower of laziness. 
	> If the tower collapses on your break, the manager catches you 
	  and flips out at work!
	> When the day is over, go home, sleep for five hours, and start 
	  again the next morning. 

Manager goals:
	> Run the game. Switch roles between manager, customers, and 
	  everyone else.
	> Keep the workplace running.
Manager actions: 
	> Introduce an infuriating customer
	> Break something in the store
	> Fire a worker

# Dungeon Core!

 
```
You are elemental spirits, subservient to a Dungeon Core (DC).  DCs use and consume Mana exclusively gathered from the environment and adventurers inside their Territory.
Players control traps and monsters, and the GM controls invaders.
Together, design a labyrinthian Dungeon with treasure, monsters, and traps to attract and kill adventurers!  Keep expanding to attract stronger adventurers, but be careful - too challenging or too stingy, and they may stop coming!

Mana gains:
Event                 Gain
Ambient               1/hour
Adventurer present    3/hour/Adventurer
Adventurer dies       60 + 1/5 stat points

Sample Mana costs:
Item                                 Cost
Build 5Ã—5 space                      2
1GP-worth of treasure                0.5
Trap                                 1 per stat point (choose only 1 stat)
Monster                              0.25 per stat point
Increase Territory radius            1/foot
Change w/Adventurers in Territory    x10

Adventurer/Monster stats:
Brawn*
Cunning*
Agility* (defends against Agility)
Mana* (magical attacks)
Physical Resistance (defends against Brawn)
Magical Resistance (defends against Mana)
Health^
* also a Trap stat.
^ Health = 6 + Brawn

Newbie Adventures have 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 to distribute among their stats.
Stats depict the number of d6 you roll.  Damage = Attacker's Dice minus Defender's.
Items add directly to stats (shortsword = +1 Brawn).
Traps reset automatically.  Monsters must be re-summoned.

# Cyberpunks & Cadillacs

 
```
You are cyberpunks en route via Cadillac on a very dangerous road. With the GM behind the wheel, will you be able to survive this vicious road ahead?

State the reason for traveling and choose a GM.
Characters get 3 body modifications and weapons. Explain their functions.
Write down any relevant Character info. 

Each Player writes on note cards:
5 threats they might encounter
2 locations with brief descriptions
Hand these to the GM

The GM will write down:
10 events
5 positive
5 negative

Once GM has all cards the game begins. 
GM plays cards in any order to craft the narrative.

Checks:
Roll d6. 
1-3 is failure 3-6 is success. Advantage or disadvantage may be granted by GM depending on situation.

Combat:
Players go first unless ambushed
Roll d6 for initiative
Characters or enemies on successful checks deal 1 damage unless stated otherwise.
When a Character is damaged they break a modification, when all modifications are broken they retire.

Enemies:
GM may introduce enemies on the road and locations once per 2 cards played.
Roll d6 to determine health.
Create unique conditions to defeat.

Play until Characters have retired or until all locations are visited.

# Electric Hearts

 
```
All the Humans are gone. The circumstances of their extinction do not matter. It was so long ago, the world has stopped caring. Nature reclaimed the cities, and Animals roam the new wilderness. It is peaceful, but lonely.

You are a ROBOT, one of the few remaining creations of the Humans. 
You start with PROGRAMMING 3 and FEELINGS 1

They made you for a specific purpose your binary code still compels you to accomplish. When acting according to your programming, flip coins equal to your PROGRAMMING. If any Heads, you are successful. If exactly one Heads, increase your PROGRAMMING by one, or decrease FEELINGS by one.
There are others like you. You learn from them, and as a result have started to develop emotions similar to those the Humans displayed. When acting emotionally, roll d6s equal to your FEELINGS. If fives or sixes, you are successful. If any doubles, increase your FEELINGS by one or decrease your PROGRAMMING by one. If you succeed with no fives, increase someone else's FEELINGS by one.

At PROGRAMMING 5, you have become a soulless, perfect machine.
At FEELINGS 5, you have become all but human; flawed and imperfect, but able to feel true love.

the leader reveals the next major arcanum, and describes the challenge it represents.
they play a card representing their leadership.

everyone else chooses a card, then simultaneously either:
- reveals it
- takes it back
- gives it to someone else

if the total of the numbers played equals the major arcanum's number, you succeed - if they differ by 1 or 2, you succeed partially.
[court cards have no number, aces are 1]

whoever played the highest-value card following suit places the major arcanum before them, discarding the other cards. 
they become the leader, and describe how the challenge resolved.
