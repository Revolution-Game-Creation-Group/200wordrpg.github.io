# Line

 
```
An absurdist live-action game for 5 players based on the play, Line by Israel Horovitz.

BIG IDEAS:
-Characters stand in a line vying to be first despite conflicting understandings of what the line is for
-Every character's top priority is to be at the front of the line
-Players stay in character and act according to their motivation
-The game ends when everyone is at the front
-Play should last 15 minutes at most

PREPARING TO PLAY:
-Mark the ground where the line begins with visible tape.

CHARACTER CREATION:
Players gather in a circle and take turns answering the following aloud:
-What is your name?
-Why is it important that you are at the front?
-What don't you like about the character to your left?

Each player rolls 1d5 (or 1d4 + Id2 [scored 1 or 0]) on the following table (each player's should be different):

Line Strategy: This is how you plan to get to the front...
1. Starts at the front of the line (you got there early)
2. Fast Talking and Confusing
3. Sex Appeal
4. Bullying
5. Opportunist

PLAY:
Enter play in ascending order according to rolls (1 starts in play).

# SchrÃ¶dinger's Underwear

 
```
- Players become characters.

- Discuss safety and consent.

- You're on a date and it's going very well. In fact, this date could end with some (very consensual) sexy times. Trouble is, you cannot remember what underwear you're wearing. Are they 'hot', or should they have been burned long ago?

- Inexplicably there's no opportunity to check your underwear situation during the date.

- Players take turns progressing one step at a time through their date.
- Start by rolling each die to recall a memory about your underwear.
- Describe your date, integrate your memory.

- Itinerary
  - Pick Up
  - Lunch
  - Activity
  - Activity
  - Activity
  - Dinner
  - Drive home
  - Pre-sexy times
    - No need to go into the sexy times, game ends when underwear is revealed.

- Dice

  - d6 = The recollection comes from something you...
    - 6. Touch
    - 5. Taste
    - 4. Hear
    - 3. See
    - 2. Smell
    - 1. Sudden memory (wild)
      - Limit 2 repeats

  - d4 = the recalled perception of your underwear
    - 4  -->   -->   --> 1
    - Yay / OK / Meh / Boo

  - d8 = your confidence in your recollection 
    - 8 high --> 1 low

- Track your overall confidence (d8), weighed against your perception (d4).

- During the last round, consider your overall confidence and describe how you go about revealing your underwear. Describe your underwear based on what you have deduced.

# The Panopticon Must Fall

 
```
Write down your Faction's name and Plan to break free of the Overseer's tyrannical rule. Also write down, "My faction's base is on floor __ of Paradise, but when the Overseer checks the camera feeds for my floor, it Thinks It Sees floor __." Put the same number in both blanks. 

Each turn, you can either Comply, Conspire, or Rewire Cameras. Discuss it, then declare simultaneously.

If you Conspire, gain one Preparation. If you Comply, you are safe. If you Rewire Cameras, pick two Factions. They switch the floor number that the Overseer Thinks It Sees for their floor.

At the end of each turn, everyone who Conspired points to the faction the Overseer Thinks It Sees for their floor. Those faction are raided. If you are raided and didn't Comply this turn, you are Purged. Change your faction's name and Plan. Set your Preparation to zero. 

Once you have 4 Preparation, you enact your Plan. The game ends. The factions with 3 Preparation become the new order. Factions with 2 Preparation are torn apart in the turmoil. Factions with less Preparation are lost to history.

For a longer game, randomly determine if Plans fail. Failed plans get your Faction Purged.
