# Villa Diodati

 
```
You are romantic poetical bods
Swapping ghost-tales in a storm-beset manse.
Take turns describing creatures - each at odds
With nature. 
	     Your Poet's Skills will enhance
Their creation and help them to survive.
Before you start, write down their name, a Vice,
A Strength, a Love, a Fear. These will best drive
Things if you don't confer. 
			    By chance device,
Select a player: They describe some beast, 
Or its story, and now IT STALKS THE HOUSE.
The next defeats it - IF a Skill allows -
Describing their efforts. Then this repeats.

If they've NO related Skill, you lose a Dread
Point. End the game once five Dread Points have fled.

# Speak with Dead

 
```
To begin, players introduce their mediums and gives an interesting story about the location.  They must each briefly shuffle or handle the deck.

Taking turns each medium closes their eyes, and asks a question of the spirits.  The Spirits (other players) draw a single card, discarding it face down.  Without discussion, they describe or enact the response.  One spirit may narrate the whole response or each may contribute a part.  Messages from the spirits are often confusing.  The current medium may not ask for clarification but may offer their own interpretation.  Any player may touch the deck to end the response and the turn.

When drawing a five or less (including aces), the spirits remain silent, discard the card and wait for the medium to pass their turn.  Otherwise the attitude of the response is decided by the suit of the drawn card. Face cards add an identifiable apparition of some kind.  Responses may include, noises, whispers, memories, apparitions and even movement of furniture.

Six and up:
Heart: Emotion, Memory
Diamond: Definite Affirmative
Club: Violence, Movement
Spade: Definite Denial
Jack: Child
Queen: Woman
King: Man

The night ends when the mediums are certain of the truth or have fled.

# The Long Stair

 
```
Our world has ended.

To repair the disparate strands, gather:

]__  A special Token.
     ]__  An illustrated Tarot Deck.
          ]__  And three Perspectives.

Each Perspective claims an aspect of The Wanderer:

Past (Before the End) / Present (In the Wasteland) / Future (Upon The Long Stair)

As we rediscover: Our Origins / Our Self / Ourselves.

Prepare the cards.

Major Arcana embody the Obstacles in our path.

Minor Arcana are the People / Places / Things that spur us on.

Separate and shuffle the two decks.

Each Perspective draws an Obstacle. Place it face up in a staggered row, like steps.

The first of three Flights.

Each poses a question.
 
]__  How did the world end?
     ]__  Who have we become?
          ]__  What might we hold on to?

These are but examples. Let them inspire you.

Art / Text / Subtext

Claim the Token to set a scene exploring your Obstacle.

When the time is right, turn a Minor Arcana face up. Give it life.

Accept it to Bridge Past to Present to Future to ...

Pass or claim the Token to explore another Perspective.

Become an advocate for their Obstacle. Become a force for growth.

Paint The Wanderer in three voices.

]__  Bridge the cards.
     ]__  Draw the next Flight.
          ]__  Discover yourself.

Then fade to black.

# You Are Beautiful
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: emotional intensity !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The person with the lightest eyes says: Welcome to this space. This space is safe. I value you, myself, and this space we are sharing. I am ready to be your witness and be witnessed by you.

The person with the darkest eyes then says the same thing back.

Decide who will speak first. The other person will witness.

The speaking person then tells a story from their past, an event or moment they are uncomfortable with, not proud of, or that is a confession of something they feel guilty for. The story can be short, long, or somewhere in between. They may also speak about something they dislike or are insecure about themselves. Give all the context needed. 

Once the story is told and silence is hanging, the witnessing person reaches over, takes the speaking person's hands, holds them gently, looks into their eyes and says, "You are beautiful."

The hands are released once the speaking person says, "Thank you."

The experience proceeds going back and forth until either person says, "Thank you for witnessing me and letting me witness you." 

The other person responds, saying the same, and the experience is over.

# Wax Nostalgic

 
```
The Wax Museum, your forever home, is aflame. You, resident ghosts, watch as the only bodies you've known for ages melt into flesh-colored puddles. This is your last night to possess your favorites; choose wisely!

Light a two-sided candle or tealight in the middle of the table; when it goes out the game ends.
Turn off the lights.
Each ghost chooses a famous or historical person; that's the mannequin you possess first.
Each ghost, light your own tea candle.
Pick a discussion topic such as "What's the secret of a fulfilled life?"
Each ghost role-plays with the others; speaking in the wax mannequin's character. If you break character, the ghost to your right gets one puff to blow out your candle. 
If your candle is blown out, your mannequin has melted, and you must choose a new mannequin to possess. You can immediately try to strike one match to relight your candle. If you fail in striking the match or lighting your candle, you must wait to try again when the next ghost fails to stay in character. 
When the center candle burns out the game is over. Any ghost with an unlit tea candle has perished forever!

# Keep It Together: A Game About Zombies

 
```

               You are zombies. Start with all LIMBS unless you choose otherwise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slot #     |   Limb         |      Actions                                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.         |   Head         |      Communication, Noticing, Cleverness, **Biting**      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.         |   Arm          |      Dexterity, **Crawling**                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.         |   Second Arm   |      Lugging                                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.         |   Leg          |      Jumping, **Jump Scares**                             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.         |   Second Leg   |      Stealth, **Running**                                 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.         |   Fun Bits     |      Intimate Moments, Wacky Powers, **Creeping Out**     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform ACTIONS, roll 1d8 using the appropriate LIMB'S # as TARGET (starred ACTIONS: +1 to TARGET per missing LIMB). If lacking appropriate LIMB, roll damage first ("Second Arm/Leg" ACTIONS require two arms/legs).
 
Rolling TARGET or lower = success. Upon failing, roll damage.

Roll damage using 1d6. If you have an appendage there, it's destroyed. If not, die. Revive at the end of the scene if another player survived/used a VICTIM.

After every scene you don't die in, do one:

- Scavenge THREAD or random LIMB

- Infect: must have bitten a human this scene. Upon death, you may live on as your VICTIM instead.

- Repair someone: spend one THREAD to attach one LIMB anywhere one's missing, even the "wrong" slot. Use the slot you attached it to when rolling damage, but that LIMB'S normal # for attempting ACTIONS. New Fun Bits can be anything: genitalia, chainsaws, backpacks.

# Kuleshov Effect RPG

 
```
Players explore mysterious castle/cave/laboratory/etc. where surprises lurk behind every corner.

Character: two Skills ('Swimming'), one Item ('Crossbow'), two Traits ('Generous', 'Arachnophobic').

Resolution: 1d20, 10+ for partial, 15+ for full success. Add +1 if prepared, +1 if relevant Item, +1 if relevant Skill, +1 per xp spent, -1 if relevant impediment.

Players take turns being Leader. Whenever the party turns a corner or discovers something new, the Leader makes a Kuleshov roll - 2d20 on the table:

1. Bizarre
2. Clever
3. Deadly
4. Disgusting
5. Enormous
6. Familiar
7. Funny
8. Hostile
9. Legendary
10. Mundane
11. Mysterious
12. Old
13. Ominous
14. Reassuring
15. Revelatory
16. Suspicious
17. Unique
18. Unreliable
19. Useful
20. Valuable

The Leader then describes what they see according to the adjectives they rolled.

e.g. Disgusting + Useful = skeleton key made from human bones
Hostile + Unique = angry albino zebra

Doubles mean the opposite of the adjective rolled.

+1 xp when you overcome significant danger or when your Trait interferes with the party's interests.
Spend 1xp to add +1 to resolution roll, 1xp to reroll 1 Kuleshov die, 5xp for new Skill.

GM has final say on all disputes.
