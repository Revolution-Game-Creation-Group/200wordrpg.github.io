# Villa Diodati

 
```
You are romantic poetical bods
Swapping ghost-tales in a storm-beset manse.
Take turns describing creatures - each at odds
With nature. 
	     Your Poet's Skills will enhance
Their creation and help them to survive.
Before you start, write down their name, a Vice,
A Strength, a Love, a Fear. These will best drive
Things if you don't confer. 
			    By chance device,
Select a player: They describe some beast, 
Or its story, and now IT STALKS THE HOUSE.
The next defeats it - IF a Skill allows -
Describing their efforts. Then this repeats.

If they've NO related Skill, you lose a Dread
Point. End the game once five Dread Points have fled.

# CAT vs GHOST

 
```
For two players

One of you is a CAT. One of you is a GHOST. The ghost is haunting the house where the cat lives with some PEOPLE.

Choose a name, pronouns, and one short tag to describe yourself. Together, describe the house and the people who live here.

Cats can be SMART or FIERCE. Ghosts can be SPOOKY or SNEAKY. People can be SCARED or COMFORTED.

The ghost begins by describing how they haunt the house. They should set up a problem for the cat. The cat then either chooses how they address the problem (smart/fierce) OR how the people react (scared/comforted). The ghost chooses the other. Both players make their choice, then reveal them. The cat describes how they handle the problem, consistent with what was chosen (e.g. fierce and comforting). Based on the cat's narration, the ghost assigns them another tag.

Now the cat sets up a problem for the ghost, to be resolved in the same way: the ghost chooses either how they address the problem (spooky/sneaky) OR how the people react (scared/comforted).

After six scenes, evaluate how the people feel. Decide together how they address the situation.

# I'm Missing You (Riccardo Cocciante)
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Suicide , Abusing Relationships. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Start a music album, possibly a songwriter's.

Describe your Character with; a Name, one Relation to each other Character, a personal problem, an Aspiration.

The most tired player is the first Turn Player. Starts describing their Aspiration.
If another player LIKES what's hearing, he interrupts narrating the Turn Player's problem by their character POW. Mark that player's Problem.

The TP can now;
Renounce telling and pass turn (mark TP's Aspiration).
Negate the problem (mark the interrupter Name) and keep narrating until another player's interruption.
Ignore the interruption calling the Relation (TP mark their Relation toward that character).
If the TP ends their narration, turns pass to the right. If no interruption happened, TP marks own name x2, other players: mark relation toward TP.

When the album ends, in order:
every aspect of a Character is marked => character suicides.

two players have their respective relationship marked:
one such player mark their Aspiration or Name.
OR both player deletes their Relation.

2 marks on Aspiration => delete Aspiration.

2 marks on Name: => Mark Aspiration or one Relation. 

All players can now delete one mark from their character. Restart the album, narration continues. No Aspiration => Narrate lack of Aspiration.

Game ends at  first suicide.

# We collaterally effected (a warm-up game)

 
```
We play those, whose lives were altered, but who where ignored by the narrative for far.

Recount the events from the last RPG session.

Everyone rolls D20s. Re-roll to break ties. Game order: high -> low.
The first player describes a non-exclusive meeting place, like a pub.

Then, one by one, every player (starting with the pub describer):
* ... thinks of a reasonable effect of the events, that have gone largely unnoticed so far.
* ... chooses or comes up with a figure in the story, that has been strongly impacted by that effect.
* ... portrays and plays that figure, telling her story.

... while listening to her story, the other, attentive player place tokens (dice work) in front of the talking player, whenever:
* the narration is surprising, but fits the setting
* the player now feels differently about aspects of the events
* the portrayal of the figure brings the setting to life

Everyone counts the tokens they got.
The players with the most tokens are encouraged to narrate a moment during the evenings main game where their figures from this warm-up game -by pure happenstance- creates a small, positive situation; the figure distracting a suspicious guard for a moment, for example. Subject to GM/table veto.
