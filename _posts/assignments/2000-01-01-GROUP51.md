# The Speakables

 
```
Speakables are arcane investigators who can talk you to death. Each Speakable has a Keyword about 6-7 letters long describing the character and a Lexicon, a word game a suspect must participate in once begun. If investigators are ever bested while employing this Lexicon their Keyword loses one letter. Losing all your letters renders you mute and destroys your rapport with a suspect. You may still write or use charades, unbound by your Lexicon's restrictions. Some suspects may  require besting more than once, or in a certain order, before giving evidence or losing their own powers.

Lexicons:

Interrogator- Participants only speak in questions.
Shadower- Begins each sentence with the last letter of previous sentence.
Magician- Forces participants to "spell" a correctly-used word from another's dialogue.
Decoder- Limits participants to ten-word vocabulary chosen by Decrypter.
Bookbinder- Traps words by writing them down, rendering them forbidden.

Word Crimes:

1. Grimoire Plagiarism
2. Poetry Without a License
3. Loose Tongues
4. Ambush Aphasia
5. Violent Interruption
6. Worder (murder of Magic Words)

Before starting, have someone observing write down the Last Word, an uncommon one, secretly. When this gets said everyone must solve the crime or be rendered Speechless, ending the game.

# Canticula Deperita

 
```
Everyone needs a text, a trinket and a randomisation tool. The GM needs a book from a different roleplaying game.

Dim the lights, sit in a circle (on the floor if you can). Put your text, trinkets and tools in the middle.   GM, turn to a random page in your book and read it in its entirety.  Take it seriously.

The world ended a thousand years ago.  You are knowledge keepers, collecting divine fragments from the past.  Whenever you attempt an action, you must perform all your rituals correctly or the action will fail.

At the end of every half-hour, time passes.  Get up and explore your environment.  Find a new text or trinket.  Return to the circle and describe how the thing you've found combines with the objects in the centre to form a new ritual.  GM, read the entirety of a different page.

Read extracts from texts, perform motions with your trinkets, make dice rolls or coin flips and explain how the result is a sign from your gods.  Do not make your rituals easy.

When your accumulated rituals become too hard for you to perform every time, describe how your rituals caused the world to end again.

They thought you were sleeping when they implanted the thing in your head. 

Who? Why? Is it dangerous?

A bundle of clues sits on your nightstand. Who could have left it?
There's a note in a code you understand: "If you want to know, find out why you don't want to go" followed by several numbers. There's a one-day bus pass and directions to the nearest bus stop.

Make your clues using numbers from a fortune cookie, or from gaming dice. 

When you have plenty of time, take a pen, the bus pass and clues to the bus stop and start your investigation.

Take notes in code.

What makes you want to avoid going where you'll find the answers?
Who wouldn't want you in these places? 
Why do they want you to stay away?
Is "common sense safety" just the aversion effect of your implant?
The numbers will take you to places you don't want to go.  Are they bus routes, the number of stops you should ride, numbers you'll recognize in clues, street addresses of important places? 

When you've solved the mystery, will you return home, or will what you learn change everything?

# Voulez-Vous

 
```
This is a jukebox musical tabletop roleplaying game.

To start, decide on a playlist-create one yourself, or put an artist, album, or genre on shuffle.

Agree on a setting ("an island off the coast of Greece," "a caf√© in New York City," "a space station orbiting Venus"). Go as mundane or wild as you want, but make sure everyone's on-board. 

Go around the table hitting play on the playlist and listening to one song per player, then pausing. Everyone creates a character, using their song as inspiration.

Play out scenes as these characters.

When you're approaching a turning point for your character, or no one knows what happens next, press play and listen to one song. Don't worry about its literal content if you're not already familiar; focus on the energy.

Sing along. Have fun.

You can begin discussing the song while it's playing, or after. How does it fit into the current storyline? If it seems out of place, how does it actually make perfect sense? Describe visuals, choreography, which characters sing when. Anyone can contribute, but whoever hit play has final say. 

When you have a clear picture of the scene, continue as before.

-hits your date's ball and ___ ends up closer to the hole... 
-their ball: you say something that your date finds charming. What is it?
-your ball: your date is offended by something you said offhand. What is it? How is it resolved?

If you ___  on the winner and... 
-agreed

-were wrong: For some reason you never went on a second date, where did you go from there?

-were right: You wanted to go on another date, but never did. What about them made you want to go on another?

# OH NO, IT'S GAY!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: romance & sexuality !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
OH NO, IT'S GAY!
a game for two or more

You are gay. They are cute.
It's a problem, for some reason. Decide why.

You each have a pile of six-sided dice.
Each player's dice should be of a single unique color.

RULES FOR TWO OR THREE:
Start flirting. Maybe you're roleplaying. Maybe it's real life. Who knows.
When a player's flirting has its intended effect on you, stack one of your dice. All dice are stacked in the center of the table in a single column, each player adding their own on top of the others. Be careful ... or don't?
When the dice stack falls, the last to add a die must confess their feelings to the other player(s), who may of course react however they like.

RULES FOR MORE THAN THREE:
Each player keeps their own stack of dice.
Each player still has their own color, but when a player flirts successfully, one of their dice is taken and added to that player's stack. When a stack falls, the player must confess their feelings to either the person who had the most dice in the fallen stack, or to the person whose die was added last.
