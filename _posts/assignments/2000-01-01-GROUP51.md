# The Speakables

 
```
Speakables are arcane investigators who can talk you to death. Each Speakable has a Keyword about 6-7 letters long describing the character and a Lexicon, a word game a suspect must participate in once begun. If investigators are ever bested while employing this Lexicon their Keyword loses one letter. Losing all your letters renders you mute and destroys your rapport with a suspect. You may still write or use charades, unbound by your Lexicon's restrictions. Some suspects may  require besting more than once, or in a certain order, before giving evidence or losing their own powers.

Lexicons:

Interrogator- Participants only speak in questions.
Shadower- Begins each sentence with the last letter of previous sentence.
Magician- Forces participants to "spell" a correctly-used word from another's dialogue.
Decoder- Limits participants to ten-word vocabulary chosen by Decrypter.
Bookbinder- Traps words by writing them down, rendering them forbidden.

Word Crimes:

1. Grimoire Plagiarism
2. Poetry Without a License
3. Loose Tongues
4. Ambush Aphasia
5. Violent Interruption
6. Worder (murder of Magic Words)

Before starting, have someone observing write down the Last Word, an uncommon one, secretly. When this gets said everyone must solve the crime or be rendered Speechless, ending the game.

# In The Court of Azathoth

 
```
Each player names and nobly titles their demonic courtier and secretly allocates 100 points across the following: 
Malfeasance
Exhortation
Dereliction
Contrivance

In ascending order of Malfeasance, players take turns trying to Goad, Beg, or Trick dread lord Azathoth into destroying one aspect of the world by rolling a 100-sided die and seeing if the result is lower than their rating in Exhortation, Dereliction, or Contrivance, respectively. If it is, the player to take their turn after them determines the method of destruction and describes it.

A player can only Trick Azathoth if the player before them succeeded. When a player Tricks Azathoth successfully, they undo that player's destruction.

After a player successfully Goads Azathoth, their Exhortation is permanently divided in half and until their next turn no other player may Goad or Trick Azathoth.

At any time a player may declare their courtier "satisfied." Other players get one more turn each before Azathoth becomes bored and returns to slumber, then the game ends and the group interprets the remnants of the world as a possible setting for a future tabletop rpg.

# Pirate Showdown

 
```
You're a pirate clashing swords with another sea wolf, however neither of you knows how to wield the steel in your hands, so there's only one option left: bruise each other's honor with words.

You and your opponent take turns clashing as striker and comebacker. The striker randomly opens up a dictionary, chooses at least one word and then must use it in a phrase to praise their own glory and "superior fighting abilities", or simply to hurt the opponent's honor. The comebacker must quickly retaliate, phrasing with any unused words from the already opened dictionary. There's no rejoinder. The pirates just stare at each other and prepare themselves for the next clash.

Players must utter like angry pirates. Whoever reacts out of character (e.g. laughs, is startled, becomes speechless) or is unable to form a sentence, takes one damage point to the honor for each chosen word used by the opponent at the current clash. When a pirate's honor takes three damage points, the pirate loses the game.

If players word prejudice, discrimination, harassment ou hate speech, they lose the game. Actually, they also lose in life

# Free Range

 
```
Greetings, fellow Fumoggulians! We hope you had a great time coming out of stasis. Our next destination, Earth, has just been reached. As on previous planets, we will equip you with the necessary morphological changes. Two arms, what a hoot! Remember, eyes are tricky, so please don't forget to put on your shades.

Our group will be shuttled to a large trade building, where the Earthlings purchase their goods. Each traveller will be provided with a special Earth device, a primitive mobile computing unit, that can also make sensory recording. Don't hesitate to use them, it's fun! Please also be reminded of our policy to not directly engage with lifeforms beyond small talk. When approached, we recommend showing your "teeth" in the upper frontal orifice a bit and using one of the following sentences provided by the installed xenotranslator: 

"Hey, nice!" 
"Cool day?"
"Wow..."
"That's great."

After a set period of 30 Earth minutes we will meet again in front of the trade building, where a camouflaged shuttle will pick us up. We will finish the trip by sharing our recordings and voting for the most hilarious one. The winner gets an Earthling hat!

# Fall from Grace
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence, killing !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```


Your Grace score begins at 9. To do anything, Roll a d10. If it's Social, ROLL UNDER to succeed; if it's Violent, ROLL OVER. Killing someone permanently lowers your Grace by 1, changing the target numbers for all future rolls. If you ever reach 0 Grace, you die and your story ends. You can no longer accomplish any goals, but you may narrate an epilogue to contextualize your death. 

Before each roll, state your Goal and whether you're approaching it Socially or Violently; the GM offers available actions toward that goal within that approach. 
Player: "I want this guy to back off..."
"...using Violence."
GM: "He's kind of a pushover; you only need to rough him up."
"...using Social."
GM: "Because he's honest, bribes won't work. Lies or threats are fair game."

Narrative advantages let you roll additional dice (1 for each narrative element, max 3). Social elements may include bribes or calling in favors. Violent elements can include weapons or advantageous terrain. 

If you tie your Grace score in a social situation, you can kill someone who isn't an immediate threat to you (no roll) to achieve your Goal despite failing. (You still pay the Grace cost.)

# Space Cowboys

 
```
Blood-thirsty Outlaws are terrorizing our peacefull Galaxy! Such reckless times require equally hot-headed heroes!

There is one Captain, who tells the story. Other players play as Cowboys - beautifully crazed bandit hunters. To create a Cowboy player should choose Badassness ("Drunken Monk", "Sexy Pilot", "Bold Grunt" or come up with their) and randomly receive Hidden Agenda ("Make love with...", "Vendetta on...", "Trick...", "Destroy..." - the target for Agenda could be a party member, Outlaw or even some special object). They also describe their Ships with one Style- "Speeder", "Stomper", "Trapper" etc.

The Captain describes an Outlaw with 3 Cunnings such as "Bug Collector", "Giant Mothership", "Smokes Poison", "etc. And of course one Edgy Plot - "Rob a Strip Planet", "Kill President of the Galaxy" etc.

Cowboys need to capture Outlaw, but each of them has to secretly fullfill their Agenda.

When Cowboy should overcome Danger, they roll 2d6. If they can use their Badassnes, they get to reroll one die. 1-4 counts as Very Bad, 5-9 as Goes Partly As Planned, 10-12 as Badass!

Outlaw is roleplayed accordingly to his Cunnings (define character and give benefits that Captain thinks are necessary) and Edgy Plot.

# Romancing the home

 
```

a human and a building have fallen in love, and this is a game about that for two players. the game occurs over the course of three rounds, each representing a decade. each player draws five cards from a 52 card deck. the suits of the cards represent their character's desire. the values represent how understandable those desires are.

before the first round, the players decide which character they are playing: human, or building. they should each describe their characters to each other-their names, pronouns, ages, structural motifs, etc.

during each round both players choose a card from their hand and play them simultaneously. compare the cards, noting the difference in suits & values. consult the tables below to determine what the characters desire, and narrate a scene about that. two cards from the same suit always result in an understanding, regardless of value.

after three rounds, the players must choose one of their two remaining cards to represent how their character feels when they eventually part ways, as humans and buildings always do.


value difference		result
--------------------------------------------------------
0-2				understanding
3-5				not understanding
6+				misunderstanding


suit				desire
--------------------------------------------------------
hearts				tenderness, admiration
diamonds			publicity, celebration
spades				privacy, distance
clubs				roughness, antagonism
