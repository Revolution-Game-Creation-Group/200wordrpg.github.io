# A Load of Cobblers

 
```
You are cobblers from a grand fantasy city trying to one-up each other about how the boots you made were more vital to a deadly quest than the last.

The boots you made were:

Trait:    D6	    	boots of	Trait: D6
1	Invisible			Dancing	
2	Dragon Skin			Standing still
3	Stone				Noisiness
4	Enmagicked			Love
5	Floral				Music
6	Hairy				Telepathy

The hero wearing boots:

        D6	     +	        D6
1	Star			Horse
2	Fire			Tiger
3	Jittery			Kitten
4	Thunder		        Duck
5	Tiny			Goose
6	Frenzied                Mantis

Each player takes a turn in telling a 6 minute (maximum) story about the climactic moment of a quest in which the boots they made were vital the success of the hero in that scene. The player telling the story is the active player.

A coin or token is awarded every time the active player describes a moment where a Trait of the boots was vital to the success of [insert hero] in the scene described. Coins are awarded by the listening cobblers. Coins are not given if a specific use of a Trait has been described already.

A story being told should make sense, and not be contradictory or repetitive.

# In The Court of Azathoth

 
```
Each player names and nobly titles their demonic courtier and secretly allocates 100 points across the following: 
Malfeasance
Exhortation
Dereliction
Contrivance

In ascending order of Malfeasance, players take turns trying to Goad, Beg, or Trick dread lord Azathoth into destroying one aspect of the world by rolling a 100-sided die and seeing if the result is lower than their rating in Exhortation, Dereliction, or Contrivance, respectively. If it is, the player to take their turn after them determines the method of destruction and describes it.

A player can only Trick Azathoth if the player before them succeeded. When a player Tricks Azathoth successfully, they undo that player's destruction.

After a player successfully Goads Azathoth, their Exhortation is permanently divided in half and until their next turn no other player may Goad or Trick Azathoth.

At any time a player may declare their courtier "satisfied." Other players get one more turn each before Azathoth becomes bored and returns to slumber, then the game ends and the group interprets the remnants of the world as a possible setting for a future tabletop rpg.

# Onwards and upwards

 
```
Pollution and war made Earth unlivable, and humanity are looking to Mars. Going to Mars is expensive. You are poor. You will have to get there through sneaking on ships, forging papers, and by other Illegal means.
Each player has his own set of cards (no jokers), and starts the game with a hand of 5 cards. When trying to achieve something, he will play a card from his hand (ace=1, jack=11, queen=12, king=13), and if the number is greater than or equal to an undisclosed goal number Set by the GM, the player succeeds (the task).
_______________________________________________________________
Drawing and damage
a player can always redraw back to 5 cards. If he does that after he played all the cards in his hand, he first reshuffles the played cards back to the deck. If a player chooses to redraw before emptying his hand, he throws the played cards to the discard pile.
Whenever a character gets hit and suffers damage, the player must throw 5 cards from the top of his deck to the discard pile.
If a player discards his entire deck, his character dies.

This game needs a GM and two or more players. 

A world is being devastated. The GM explains how, and what can save it. The players are in charge of saving as much as possible.

Each player chooses a name, role, and three people, principles, or things that are important to them. The GM starts a secret tracker. Play begins.

The GM creates a disaster and says who or what it will doom. Any player may sacrifice something important to stop it, explaining how. If no one does, the GM records what is lost and adds 1 to the tracker. If someone does, the GM records what was saved and adds d4 to the tracker. The GM then names the next disaster.

When the tracker reaches (Players x4), the GM gives an update on the end of the world. When the tracker reaches (Players x7), the GM explains how the players have almost won. When the tracker reaches (Players x8), the disasters end.

The GM explains what was lost and what was saved. Each player explains what their place in the new world is, and what their sacrifices left them with.

Decide if the result was worth the cost.

# Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme

 
```
This game has two roles: THE LOVER and THE WORLD

LOVER: You are in love, but your love has refused you. Write down what they dislike about you on notecards (poor, short, cowardly, etc). They have given you an impossible task in order to win their hand, and you intend to see it through.

WORLD: You are vast and filled with magic. Many things seem impossible, but nothing is truly so, if one is willing to change. 

Each scene, THE WORLD describes a challenge THE LOVER faces on their quest. Together, you discuss how the challenge is resolved. If you cannot agree, flip a coin. At the end of the scene, THE WORLD gives THE LOVER a new notecard with a new quality on it- something they learned or developed from this challenge. THE WORLD may also take an old notecard away, if they feel the quality no longer applies based on THE LOVER's actions.

The game ends when all THE LOVER's original qualities are gone. Together, THE LOVER and THE WORLD describe how the impossible task was completed, and THE LOVER returns home a changed person, to decide if they still desire the love they have now won.

Your planet is dying. 

You are a team of researchers sent to assess if Earth can be a new home where your few remaining people could peacefully settle. Disguised as regular Earthlings, you will clandestinely collect data on this peculiar place and its inhabitants. During the game, discuss your findings and reach a conclusion.

To start, name your researcher, then select 2 descriptors to guide role-playing them:
-Optimistic
-Pessimistic
-Scientific
-Philosophical
-Anthropological
-Idealistic
-Cynical
-Pragmatic
-Other?

Create a group chat accessible to all players. Over an agreed upon timeframe (1-3 days?) talk with your fellow researchers, detailing your observations to them using text, pictures, audio, whatever. Players may use their real-world observations to guide their role-playing (don't identify real people without permission). 

During play, allow the following to emerge in conversation if/when appropriate:
-What's happening to your planet?
-How has it affected you? 
-What there can never be replicated? 
-How is Earth beautiful/intriguing? 
-How is Earth terrifying/strange? 
-What will those you love think of Earth?

To conclude, discuss:
-What you learned about Earth.
-If Earth is a suitable new home.

Collectively, write up your formal recommendation.

Afterwards, consider what you, the player, learned from your observations.
