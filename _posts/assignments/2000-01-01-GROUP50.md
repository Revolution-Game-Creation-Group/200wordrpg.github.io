# A Load of Cobblers

 
```
You are cobblers from a grand fantasy city trying to one-up each other about how the boots you made were more vital to a deadly quest than the last.

The boots you made were:

Trait:    D6	    	boots of	Trait: D6
1	Invisible			Dancing	
2	Dragon Skin			Standing still
3	Stone				Noisiness
4	Enmagicked			Love
5	Floral				Music
6	Hairy				Telepathy

The hero wearing boots:

        D6	     +	        D6
1	Star			Horse
2	Fire			Tiger
3	Jittery			Kitten
4	Thunder		        Duck
5	Tiny			Goose
6	Frenzied                Mantis

Each player takes a turn in telling a 6 minute (maximum) story about the climactic moment of a quest in which the boots they made were vital the success of the hero in that scene. The player telling the story is the active player.

A coin or token is awarded every time the active player describes a moment where a Trait of the boots was vital to the success of [insert hero] in the scene described. Coins are awarded by the listening cobblers. Coins are not given if a specific use of a Trait has been described already.

A story being told should make sense, and not be contradictory or repetitive.

```


Seelie Court fae inhabiting the woods are treated with wary reverence; not so with the Faecetiae of the Unseemly Court, who hide pornographic magazines in the woods. Their power waned as the internet spread, and their domain is on the edge of destruction. Faecetiae must get their hands dirty to avert a crisis.

Safety

Don't play this game.

Play

Celebrate a seasonal feast. Brag about magazines and the corruption they engender.

Each fae hides their magazine in the woods; other fae watch and verify. Vote; whoever hid best wins ties for Monarch election.

Wait two weeks. A fae geas prevents talking about or touching the magazines.

Untouched: 0
Missing: 1
Clearly disturbed: 3
Undeniable evidence of use: 5

Average total points determine fate of the realm: 

<1: Complete destruction

```
This game is about the tension of partying with intentions, set inside a nightclub. 

Each player sets a goal they want to achieve. The GM adjudicates.
 
Each character has a list of 10 adjectives, corresponding to their mood: 
 
1. Joyful 
2. Confident 
3. _____ 
4. _____ 
5. _____ 
6. _____
7. Insecure 
8. Intoxicated 
9. Resentful 
10. Dejected
 
Blanks are custom.
 
To resolve a challenge or move a scene a player may either: 
-roll a d10 to determine a mood. 
-choose a mood, and burn it. 

The player and GM then explains how their character's mood is used to impact events.

A burned mood may not be used again. If rolled, the result takes +1. 
 
At any time, a player may offer a mood to another, either traded or gifted. If accepted, the mood is removed, written secretly on a piece of paper, and passed over face-down. This replaces an entry on the recipient's list, their choice.

Recipients may either:
-turn it over, which triggers it and burns it.
-leave it until a roll reveals it. 

Once a mood is revealed, players should explain how their characters' interactions determine the outcome.  
 
Play continues until a player has achieved their objective, or is burnt out.

# Moments After - The Storytelling RPG

 
```
                    You can't believe it happened. It changed your lives forever.

                              How will you recover?

                              How will you get through this?

                              How will you survive the Moments After?


What's needed:
3+ players that enjoy drama
5-10 minutes per round


Start by introducing the group the story is about:

Each player adds either a positive or negative characteristic to the group. The number of each must be close to equal. Repeat as desired.

"Life was good; Perhaps they were happy... Until something happened...



Step 1: One player gives a word to describe a life-changing event. Each player then adds another descriptor.

Step 2: One player describes how the group reacts to this event, adding dramatic details as desired.

Step 3: All players then hold their hands out and make either a fist or thumbs up. 

If there were more thumbs up, everyone adds a positive detail to the described narrative.
If there were more fists, everyone adds a dramatic detail instead.
If more than one fist was thrown, those players that threw fists add a dramatic detail instead of a positive one.



Repeat the steps until everyone gets a turn on Step 2.

Lastly, have fun!

# The Capsule.

 
```

In which we roleplay recollections then replay other characters' differing memories!  


Setup:

Each player puts 3 mementos in a bag/time-capsule. 

Random things at-hand are great. 

We're together again. Time to exhume the capsule!  

Discuss these questions:

What brought us together then?  Now?  
Why did we bury it?  

Describe your character....  

Each player makes one notecard for each other player (completing ALL-CAPITALIZED as below).  These will guide other's roleplay by telling them how they're remembered by you. 



(REMEMBERING CHARACTERS NAME)'s  TAKE ON  (YOUR CHARACTER)

I AM:  (DESCRIPTION OF HOW YOU'RE SEEN BY THE REMEMBERER)

BECAUSE: (rememberer will describe a situation) 

YES-AND:  (ADD SOMETHING...)



Vary people's take on you. 
Connect to what's established.  

Pass out cards for "Because:" input.  

Re-collect and complete.

Redistribute so each player has a card-set describing their biases toward each other character


Play:

Take turns pulling a memento out.

Use it to frame a scene (recollecting in character). Lean into your biases. 

Rememberer hands out their cards to respective player/characters. Everyone shares information then plays accordingly!

 "Rememberer" calls scene and re-collects cards. 

Each scene elicits replays:   

Another character disagrees, describes changes (in character) and hands out their cards... 

Reenact!!!

No telling where the "truth lies";).

# Doppelgänger

 
```
Doppelgänger is a game that is played while you do other things with your group, like going out or during game night. 


You are a colony of shapeshifting creatures preparing to first take over the town and then, the world. You need to practice your impersonation skills to pass as different humans, but if you adopt too many of your target's mannerisms and personality you'll get lost in the act and won't be able to shapeshift out of it. 


The objective of the game is to lightly act as your real self. You already look like them, but now you have to imitate a mild version of yourself. If you do something that the colony deems as being too much as your real self, you'll lose.

You can prepare something to counteract this too faithful of an imitation. Hide an object in your pockets that you'd never use, wear some unseen clothing that is the opposite of your style... However, you can only have one safeguard; if you fail again you'll lose definitely.


You can add weird creature-like demeanors here and there for flavor and fun. The winners are those who remain in play at the end of the session.
