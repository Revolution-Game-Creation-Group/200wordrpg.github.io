# A Most Foul Plot, Averted?

 
```
Required: 32-card deck, four PLAYERS, GM. Shuffle cards, the Sevens separately as RANDOMIZER.

Scenario: A palace garden, diplomatic party with representatives of four KINGDOMS. 

Suits represent KINGDOMS, faces roles:

King, Queen
Ace = Royal advisor
Jack = General
Ten = Bodyguard
Nine = Handmaid
Eight = Fool

PLAYERS draw their character from the deck.

RANDOMIZER (draw, no replace) determines KINGDOM goals, known only to GM and PLAYERS of that KINGDOM:

Spade: Assassinate VICTIM KINGDOM's leaders (also knows VICTIM).
Clubs: VICTIM - uncover plot, survive.
Hearts: Host - save face.
Diamond: Profit from chaos.

PLAYERS in turns draw NPC (redraw if own KINGDOM), converse up to five minutes, four rounds. RANDOMIZER (draw and replace) determines NPC personality:

Hearts: social.
Diamond: rational.
Spade: competitive.
Clubs: fearful.

Inactive PLAYERS choose NPC looks, meeting situation. GM plays them. Invent facts as needed.

Then hue and cry is raised: "Murder! ASSASSINS!"

Each PLAYER chooses one PC or NPC TARGET they run towards to achieve their KINGDOM's goal. GM shuffles VICTIM and non-TARGET previously drawn NPCs, plus the Sevens as ASSASSINS. PLAYERS take turns drawing first an encounter on the way, then someone they find with TARGET. GM adds characters and decides action results for maximum drama.

In year 20XY, superpowered people emerged within the society, but society doesn't like them. Your group is made up of several.

You have two stats - Power and Injury. Power is any number between 2 and 11, 11 meaning your superpowers are strongest they could be, but that you suck at other things. Injury starts at 1, +1 for each injury you receive. If it reaches 13, you die. It resets after sleeping for 8 hours.

Everyone picks one thing to control. It must be made up of particles, so fire, biomass, neon, and electricity are okay, but time, life, or force aren't. No two players should have the same powers.

Whenever you need to do a task, roll 2d6 or 1d12. When involving your superpowers in task, you need to roll below Power to succeed. If you can't involve superpowers, you need to roll over Power to succeed. If you roll below your Injury, you fail automatically. When you use your superpowers, describe how. Game Master (GM) must approve your use of superpowers. Follow the Rule of Cool.

GM controls everything else by rules above. Change starting Injury for harder or easier to defeat NPCs. Have fun!

# THEY // FEED

 
```
THEY eat people. THEY spread. Your group survived. Resources are scarce. The shelter depends on you.

Each survivor needs 1 long grocery receipt, pencil, d4s. Survivors start with (100 - receipt price total) luck. Who are you? Why do you protect the shelter?

-Round all numbers down

Goals:
-Scavenge supplies
-Avoid THEM. 

Each Day: 
(1) Traveling
(2) Scavenging
(3) Transporting
(4) Resting

First 3 phases:
-Player rolls d4 for an obstacle (THEM).
-Describe location, objects, obstacle.
-Each survivor strikes-through 1+ receipt items for an action. Describe. Add your prices.
-Roll (phase #)d4 for obstacle. Add all the d4s. Do THEY notice you?
-If survivor's price >= obstacle, survivor unnoticed. Move to next phase. 
-Noticed survivors must strikethrough receipt discounts to lower notice or lose luck = highest, two d4 rolled. Describe how.

Scavenging:
Survivors find goods. Spend luck = item price. Circle receipt items and price to acquire. Survivors narrate search. How do they feel about what they find?

Resting:
Survivors hand out goods. Strikethrough circled items. Each survivor gains luck = (combined receipt item prices / player count). Narrate survivor's interaction with shelter people and group. Who are they?

Strikethrough items are gone.

0 luck or receipt items = survivor dies. Narrate their end.

# Goblin Voltron

 
```
----------

The players are goblins in a shared disguise (e.g. "Baron Notagoblin"). They must work together to accomplish a GOAL (e.g. "Bake a cake for the king") with as many STEPS as there are Goblins ("Gather ingredients", "Preheat oven", etc).

Goblins and GM alternate turns, until Goblins accomplish their Goal or get Busted.

----------

GM TURN
The GM throws an obstacle at the Goblins. They must either DO SOMETHING!!! or take a Problem.

----------

GOBLIN TURN
Players pick one:
- DO SOMETHING!!! (accomplish one Step of their Goal)
- FIX IT!!! (eliminate Problems)

----------

DO SOMETHING!!!
- On separate cards, Goblins each write down what they want their shared goblin voltron to do.
- Goblins reveal cards.
- Everything happens simultaneously; GM narrates the ridiculous results.
  ALL DIFFERENT: Total Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, but gain a Problem.
  2+ THE SAME: Controlled Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, and nothing else happens. Phew!
  ALL SAME: Cool Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, and fix a Problem in the process.

FIX IT!!!
- Pick 2 Problems.
- FIX IT!!!
- Eliminate them. (Hopefully you didn't make any more!)

----------

TOO MANY PROBLEM!!!
If Goblins have 3 or more Problems at the end of their turn, they gain a STRIKE. Three Strikes and they're BUSTED!

# Object Delusion Support Group

 
```
Each player selects an everyday item - a pen, a coin, a shoe - that they have to hand.

Players take turns revealing their item to the group. For each item, the other players act as if they have never seen such an item before and, with great bemusement, question its use and origin.

The owner of the item maintains that it is a common object in everyday use, as the rest improvise and corroborate a parallel universe where it would be nonsensical or impractical for such items to exist.

For example, if the item were a banknote, the parallel universe could be one where there is no such thing as cash, or there is no such thing as paper, or the entire concept of money does not exist. Meanwhile, the owner of the banknote is absolutely certain that it is a normal everyday object, and cannot understand why the others do not recognise it.

Turns end when creativity begins to wane. The game continues until all players have had a chance to present their item. The group must do its best to maintain the coherence of the parallel universe as it becomes increasingly outlandish with every additional object excluded.

# Everybody lose

We are (3-7) poker players but the game is only an excuse, everybody knows, maybe you even don't know how to play.

Poker deck: remove the aces, mix them, put them in the middle of the table.

Role: each player draws a secret card.
Diamonds: you are a cheater, find your piggy bank.
Hearts: you are you. stay at the game.
Spades: undercover FBI agent. Find the culprit.
Club: you are a psychopath; find the prey.

Shuffle the remaining cards, deal 5 to each player.

Game:
Each chooses 1 secret card and simultaneously reveals it, the highest wins, the owner asks a question to another player.
Those questioned must tell the truth, but with circumspection, everyone listens.
Repeat 3 times.

End of the game, the bravest reveals the first covered ace:
Diamonds: cheaters tell how they have squeezed their one out.
Hearts: wake up! Your work awaits you, choose it from the other roles. Why did you choose it?
Spades: the agents arrest. What crimes have been committed?
Club: psychopaths kill. Why precisely those prey?

# Past Your Bedtime

 
```
Dedicated to my daughter.




Two players, Parent and Child, will tell a bedtime to help the Child fall asleep. The Child has mechanics to interrupt and take over the story telling. Both players win if they tell a nice story together.

The Child divides 10 points between the following stats: pragmatism, imagination, adventure, and safety. Sleepy and Awake attributes start at zero.

The Child decides the setting and the Parent begins the story by introducing the main character. If the Parent hesitates or becomes repetitive (or for any reason at all) the Child may interrupt by moving one attribute point into Sleepy. The Child takes the story for a short time, their narration should match the attribute used. The Child may change the story in any way, including changing any previously established facts; the Parent just has to roll with it. 

If the story gets too scary, exciting or boring: increase Awake and decrease Sleepy by 1 (but not below zero.)

If Awake reaches four, the Child is too rambunctious for bedtime. When Sleepy is six, the Child falls asleep, the adult should briefly finish the story to themselves, with an ending inspired by watching their beloved child sleeping peacefully.
