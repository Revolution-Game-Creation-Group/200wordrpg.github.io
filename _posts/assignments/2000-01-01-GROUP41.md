# A Most Foul Plot, Averted?

 
```
Required: 32-card deck, four PLAYERS, GM. Shuffle cards, the Sevens separately as RANDOMIZER.

Scenario: A palace garden, diplomatic party with representatives of four KINGDOMS. 

Suits represent KINGDOMS, faces roles:

King, Queen
Ace = Royal advisor
Jack = General
Ten = Bodyguard
Nine = Handmaid
Eight = Fool

PLAYERS draw their character from the deck.

RANDOMIZER (draw, no replace) determines KINGDOM goals, known only to GM and PLAYERS of that KINGDOM:

Spade: Assassinate VICTIM KINGDOM's leaders (also knows VICTIM).
Clubs: VICTIM - uncover plot, survive.
Hearts: Host - save face.
Diamond: Profit from chaos.

PLAYERS in turns draw NPC (redraw if own KINGDOM), converse up to five minutes, four rounds. RANDOMIZER (draw and replace) determines NPC personality:

Hearts: social.
Diamond: rational.
Spade: competitive.
Clubs: fearful.

Inactive PLAYERS choose NPC looks, meeting situation. GM plays them. Invent facts as needed.

Then hue and cry is raised: "Murder! ASSASSINS!"

Each PLAYER chooses one PC or NPC TARGET they run towards to achieve their KINGDOM's goal. GM shuffles VICTIM and non-TARGET previously drawn NPCs, plus the Sevens as ASSASSINS. PLAYERS take turns drawing first an encounter on the way, then someone they find with TARGET. GM adds characters and decides action results for maximum drama.

# Make it as you go RPG

 
```
Determine turn order randomly.
Each turn, each player adds a setting element and a game mechanic.
Other players can expand on prior additions, but can't contradict or replace them.
Repeat until you're all satisfied.
Choose gamemaster (GM), random GM, or no GM.
Play the game.

Example:

Turn 1
Player A: Scifi game with 3d6 resolution mechanic, degrees of success.
Player B: Also a romance game. Classes are Mysterious Stranger, Smooth Criminal, Action Star, and The Professional.
Player C: The Earth Federation has been ravaged by the Space Dandelions, the dandy feline weed-people. Characters get +1 for actions relating to their class.

Turn 2
Player A: The Space Dandelions don't want to destroy humanity, but to integrate them into the Dandy Union. Players get tokens for successfully befriending / romancing NPCs which are used to give them benefits on other rolls.
Player B: The Dandy Union is fighting a secret war against a more powerful Earth Federation from across the multiverse. Each player gets a special ability specific to social conflict.
Player C: The campaign takes place on Mars. The special abilities must specifically affect outcomes, not provide benefits to rolls.

Let's game!

# The Accord
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Politics, Religion, Possible dark or violent themes !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The Arch-Duke and The Tyrant have decreed that hostilities between human and monster kind must end. You are corrupt, squabbling dignitaries meeting at Blighthollow to draft the accord for this uneasy peace.
You have a Need that the truce threatens. Try to alter the accord to protect your Need.

Choose a role:
- Aristocrat (Trophies)
- Bishop (Rage)
- Champion (Enemy)
- Chancellor (Scapegoat)
- Inquisitor (Prey)
- Magistrate (Plunder)
- Necromancer (Carrion)
- Priest (Fear)
- Traitor (Protection)
- Warlord (Enemy)

Separate into Human and Monster contingents. Odd one out is a "neutral" signatory (pick a second need).

Describe your character in a few words or short sentences. Define your Need more fully.

Each contingent alternates proposing amendments to the accord. Neutral parties may also make proposals. Argue each proposal's merits and flaws in-character. Draw maps, take notes, world build and make side deals as you debate.

Anyone may call for a vote at any time. If seconded, vote on the amendment. With a majority vote, the amendment is ratified and added to the accord. You cannot repeat failed proposals.
Repeat until either contingent has no more amendments they wish to propose.

Discuss the fallout of the final accord. If your Need wasn't met, what is your fate?

# Answers to Job

 
```
A game for two players: 

God - The Great Author, The Mover Unmoved. What world have you created?

Job - A person, not at ease. They have no rest, but trouble comes. How has God wronged you?


Job briefly lists God's crimes, ending: "I would speak to the Almighty, for I desire to reason with God."

God then describes the terrible form in which They appear to Job - a fire, a whirlwind, a still quiet voice. They command "Who is this that demands counsel, with words without knowledge?"


Then, God and Job play a game of Questions, Job demanding answers, and God presenting mysteries.  Each player may only speak in questions - if they make any other sort of utterance, or are struck speechless, they must flip a coin. Whenever Job flips tails, their resolve to question God is worn down. Whenever God flips tails, their aegis of mystery is eroded, a little bit. If either player gets five tails, they must concede defeat - Job must recant, contented that they are dust, or God must confess the Mysteries of Creation.


After someone concedes, narrate:

God - How do you reward Job?

Job - How do you live out the rest of your days in peace?

# Magic PANIC!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Disasters, Death, Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
As brave emergency service workers, players must use magic to arrive at and resolve crises daily.
One player is the reporter who chooses and depicts the emergencies instead.
Start the game with at least three emergencies.
Example: Breaking News! Warehouse fire across town caused by batteries is spreading, employees are trapped inside the building, a chemical cloud is moving over the city!
Magic governs play, with players casting spells following the format:
"I want to [protect, harm, alter] [object, person] with a [line, field, ball] of [fire, water, wind, earth, lightning]"
A d12 is rolled to determine a positive (>=4) or negative (<4) outcome.
A negative outcome downgrades the player's dice (e.g. d12 becomes d10).
A player is removed in dramatic fashion when they downgrade a d4.
Example: I want to protect the labourers with a ball of water! *Rolls 3 on d4*
The reporter interprets the spell and narrates outcome.
Negative outcomes change emergencies and positive outcomes resolve emergencies.
Example: The water ball amasses from your fluids; you die and begin drowning employees!
The game ends with a news report when either the players are removed, or all the emergencies are cleared.

# ACORN
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: N/A !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Setting: as desired.
Deck of cards needed for each player.
Select any 15 cards between 1 (Ace) and 5. The sum of the selected cards should not exceed 10. Add one Joker, one King and one Jack. 
Heart: Charisma
Club: Strength
Spade: Agility
Diamond: Intelligence
Shuffle your cards. When making a skill check, the GM determines the difficulty between 1 and 5 (1 = easy; 5 = difficult), draw the top card, and keep drawing until you draw the appropriate suit. If you drew => the difficulty, you succeed; otherwise, you fail. Keep the cards you drew in a discard pile.
If you run out of cards while drawing, reshuffle discards, take the top card, face down, and set it aside in a "dead" pile, then continue. 
Kings are an automatic success; Jokers are an automatic failure. 
Jacks mean something interesting happens, good or bad (determined by GM).
Suits do not matter for Jacks and Kings.
Health is your deck: if you are hit, take the top undrawn card and set it aside, face down, in the "dead" pile.
If you heal/rest, take one random "dead" card and reshuffle into your deck. You may never look at cards in the dead pile.

# Who the hell dun it?
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Murder, possibly gorey !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
For 4+ players.

~~~~~~~~~

You're invited to a party, but the host is nowhere to be seen. A blood-curdling scream rings out, and you all rush over to find the corpse of the host in this very room. Their death seems recent, meaning the killer is someone in this building, hidden among you.....

~~~~~~~~~

Players choose 1 person to be the ghost of the victim.

Come up with your character's backstory (who's the victim to you, do you know other characters, what's your job, etc.)

Ghost of the victim tells players how they died (bludgeoning, stabbing, poisoning, etc.)

Living players flip a coin secretly to determine if they're innocent (heads) or guilty (tails). Only the ghost sees the results.

~~~~~~~~~

Players look around the room, using objects or items around other players to accuse them of the murder. Everyone makes accusations, then votes who to accuse, and the ghost kills the accused. If there are still killers alive, the ghost gives a vague hint about the killer (perhaps in how they killed the accused), and the process repeats.

The game ends when all the killers are killed, and the ghost is at peace, or all innocents are killed, and the killers get away.
