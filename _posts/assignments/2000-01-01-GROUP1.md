# Interrogator and Suspect

 
```
"She did it. I'm sure. Her alibi stinks and she's always trying to dodge the important questions. But if she loses concentration for just a moment and says that ONE word, I've GOT her!"

2-5 players.

Two players play the Interrogator and the Suspect for two minutes.

Write a one word crime on a piece of paper, seen by everyone. The Suspect is forbidden to speak this word. If she does she has been exposed by the clever Interrogator and goes to jail.

The Interrogator asks where the Suspect was yesterday and further leading questions. The Suspect tells him her alibi. When two minutes has ended you change who's playing Interrogator and Suspect randomly. The new Interrogator writes down a word that the Suspect was saying under the interrogation (not like he, she, it, I, we etc.). The new Suspect now has to avoid telling the TWO forbidden words and continues to stick to the established alibi. This proceeds until the Suspect is in jail.

If the Suspect is hesitating frequently, being quiet or speaking nonsense the Interrogator may write an extra personal forbidden word for that player. If this is repeated frequently that player is going to jail.

--------------------------------
Congratulations on your purchase of the Use Dice on Table (Tm) role-playing system!
To begin, designate one user to be the CONSOLE MASTER (CM). The rest are PLAYERs.

Each PLAYER describes [a place to visit, a trinket to find, a character to meet]
Each PLAYER writes [a description of themselves, 3 items from their past]

Each PLAYER is TRAINED in two of the available commands.

Each GAME contains 6 puzzles, one solved with each command.
When all puzzles have been solved, the game is over.
--------------------------------

*Forest Clearing*
You are standing in a forest clearing. 
Sunlight filters in through the trees onto the large metal grate in the ground before you.
There are paths leading NORTH and EAST.

>help
   The available commands are:
      *GO* a direction or through danger
      *LOOK* at your surroundings
      *TALK* to other characters
      *USE* one object on another
      *ATTACK* the monsters of this land
      *THINK* about a puzzle or your mysterious past

      Ex. ["GO (place)", "THINK (thing)", "USE (object) on (object)"]

      When a PLAYER acts, and the outcome is unclear, USE d4 on Table (d6 if TRAINED):
         If the roll is less than 3: Failure

      ***When PLAYERs act, they may speak only in commands***

# Spellbook!

 
```
Spellbook!
by The High Minded


In this game, players play wizards trying to impress the High Wizard with their spellbooks. One player is the High Wizard, judge of the spellbooks. The High Wizard also makes copies of spells, usually simple combinations of symbols and text, and puts them around the game environment before the game. These can be printed on paper or actually part of the environment, such as written on a wall in chalk. Spells can also be given out by other NPCs, if you have enough players, who may require a task to earn a spell. The other players are wizards who wander the environment, collecting spells to scribe into their spellbooks. These books should be blank journal type books brought by players or provided as part of the game. There is also a place for the wizards to scribe the spells into their books using markers and other art supplies to embellish them. At a certain time, all the wizards must turn their spellbook in to be judged. The High Wizard looks over the entries and selects the spellbook which shows the most magical promise! There should be a celebration following the contest!

# Remembrance

 
```
Requires: 3-6 players, cards numbered 1-6.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heads bow. Tears swell. Rain falls.

The pastor gives blessing. The coffin of a great man is lowered into the dirt. His name is etched in stone. You pay your respects.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deal one card each. At the pub, you toast to his memory. You're his:

1.	Parent
2.	Child
3.	Spouse
4.	Best friend
5.	Colleague
6.	Old-flame.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-deal. You raise your glass and speak in turn, reflecting on how:

1.	You met him
2.	He changed your life
3.	You changed his life
4.	He changed the world
5.	The world treated him
6.	He'll be remembered.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-deal. Drinks flow. You recall the good times you shared with him:

1.	Getting drunk 
2.	Getting rich
3.	Getting laid
4.	Travelling 
5.	Breaking the law
6.	Doing good. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Re-deal. Night descends. Bitter memories stir, which cannot be left unspoken:

1.	His dark secret
2.	Why you hated him
3.	How he crossed you
4.	How you found him dead
5.	Who murdered him?
6.	Why he deserved it.

Tempers flare. You leave separately, but each return to his grave to leave something: flowers, a ring, a note... or a bladderfull of piss.

# To Thine Own Self

 
```
In TTOS, players exist in a bugged, digital landscape on the brink of collapse. Their greatest tool is Heartbreaking: the act of straining the data they are composed of to warp their virtual reality.

Each character has six Aspects of their uploaded consciousness: three Passions of the character, two Frailties such as fears or vices, and their Core motivation.
 
When attempting a task, roll 1d6, succeeding on 5+. You may also Heartbreak, risking your stability to warp the simulation around you. You gain additional dice depending on the type of Aspect you risk: +1d6 from Passions, +2d6 from Frailties, +3d6 from your Core. You succeed so long as you roll one 5 or 6.

If a 1 is rolled while Heartbreaking, that Aspect is lost, severed from your character's personality and manifesting physically in the scene. If a character has three or less Aspects, their existence is worn thin, succeeding on 6s only. If a character loses all Aspects, the GM takes control of them as they become data-starved monstrosities called Husks.

Any player near a loose Aspect can roll 1d6. On a 3+, they integrate the Aspect into themselves, otherwise it is destroyed.

# We are Centaurs: a GMless Tribe-tale

 
```
We hunt.
We protect Backwoods.
We proclaim Prophecies.

We do not help Outsiders.
We do not abandon Tribe.
We do not disturb Order.

Assume !Duties. !Duties narrate #Circumstances when needed:
!Weatherwatcher:	#Backwoods, #Elements
!Perilwarner:		#Outsiders, #Beasts
!Elderthinker:		#Tribe-life, #Wisdom
Describe one threat to Tribe for every #Circumstance. 

Name three Tribe-Centaurs each.
Describe their doings. Narrate circumstances.
Together, tell the Tribe-tale.


Hunting:
Ask others for help, for day.
-Each hunter gathers one [Supply, choose from: [Beast [Plant [Stone.
or
-Together discover one new ?Omen.

Protecting:
Sum involved ]Protectors and distinct [Supplies spent.
You...
]+[=1: ...are harmed
]+[=2: ...escape, harmed
]+[=3: ...escape
]+[=4: ...are harmed, what you protected is safe
]+[=5: ...and what you protected is safe

When harmed, you cannot Hunt and Protect for two days, burdening Tribe.

Propheting:
Spend [Supply.
Cross-out known ?Omens, and proclaim Prophecy concerning them.
Other Tribe-Centaurs settle implications of Prophecy's fulfillment:
-Which Tribe-Centaur will be Chosen?
-Will Backwoods provide?
-Will Outsiders harass Tribe?
-Will Tribe move?

When you fulfill three Prophecies, create and assume new !Duty with new #Circumstance.
Every thing can belong to one #Circumstance only.

If you'll behave un-Centaurish, you'll scorn Tribe. 
First-time means Warning. Second-time means Branding. Third-time means Exiling.

That is Order.

# Super Mega Robot Friends!

 
```
Our heroes are failing to stop the giant MONSTER...

Overcome your team's STRIFE to combine your robots into SUPER MEGABOT!

--------------------------------
~Setup~

Each player:

On one notecard, name your character, your robot, and which body part of SUPER MEGABOT you form.

On each of two notecards, write a STRIFE that describes a conflict between two friends. On the reverse sides, write BONDs that could form.

Anyone:

Shuffle and deal two notecards between each pair of players: one STRIFE side up, one BOND side up.

--------------------------------
~Game~

A player describes the MONSTER's rampage.

Everyone describes their character's reaction, then gains 2d6, or 3d6 if other players laughed. Dice gained are cumulative between rounds.

Roll simultaneously.

Take turns:

* If a die matches a neighbor's, place both on a shared STRIFE. Describe working together against the MONSTER. If the STRIFE has 4 dice, describe the STRIFE's resolution and flip it!

* Otherwise, place one die on a BOND, and describe it being stressed. A BOND with 3 dice is flipped!

A different player describes the MONSTER's rampage: repeat.

--------------------------------
~End~

Loss: No BONDs remain.

Win: No STRIFE remains. Describe how your team combines into SUPER MEGABOT to defeat the MONSTER! Sing your theme song!

# Beloved Leader in Prime of Health!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: murderous regime infighting !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Best played with 12+ and extravagant bootlicking.
Beloved Leader is NOT dying!  Talk of a succession crisis is TREASON!

ASSIGN ROLES:
  Beloved Leader
  Chancellor*	\
  Army*	 	 } *senior ministers
  SecPol* 	/
All others are lesser ministers who choose their titles.  Ministers receive three support tokens, which they can freely give any minister.

ACTIONS:
At any time...
  * Beloved Leader may execute anyone.
  * Beloved Leader may designate a senior minister Heir Apparent; only execution removes the designation.  
  * A senior minister may declare a coup.  Spend all tokens; objectors must expend that many together.  If they can't, or can't agree who pays what, the coup succeeds.  Otherwise, coup fails, and usurper is executed.
  * A senior minister may execute any minister for three tokens.

RESOLVE ACTIONS IMMEDIATELY!  Actions may not interrupt others, though unexecuted ministers may share tokens before resolution.  Beloved Leader replaces executed senior ministers from lesser ministers.

Upon a successful coup, Beloved Leader dies.  Successor executes half (round down) the remaining ministers and fills senior positions from survivors.  If any senior ministries remain empty, regime falls.

AFTERMATH:
Successor wins.
Everyone else loses if regime falls.
Anyone loses if executed.
Beloved Leader wins if Heir Apparent succeeds AND regime stands.
Others win if promoted.

# And only dust shall remain

 
```
GM: prepare a setting, characters with a backstory, scenes and a detailed plot, then ignore all of it entirely and improvise on the spot. Do not hesitate to resort to nonsense and non-sequiturs. Occasionally ask for a die roll of any kind and pretend the result affected anything in the narration.

Player: create a character with desires, flaws and drives, then justify during every scene why they need not abide by these. After each scene, ponder - in character - about the causes for your actions, the goals you tried to achieve, and how it makes you feel. Notice in particular similarities between your character's and your own emotions.

All: after each session, decide whether the game world is fair. Try to define fairness together. Wonder how much of that fairness is the GM's responsibility, and how much depends on the players' expectations, and how much comes from the rules of the game. Conclude with potentially misguided analogies between the game world and real life.

Play until everyone knows deeply in their souls that nothing matters, and then you die.

# Your Wish...

 
```
This game requires a lamp or a candle.  One of you plays a Genie the other the Master. 

The Master is avaricious or desperate. Take the lamp describing how they came to own it then proclaim "oh great Genie, grant me this wish". The wish must be world changing - the Master describes why it matters to them. 

The Genie is capricious or cruel. Hold the lamp, then respond "oh great and wise master, your wish is my command!" the Genie describes something of themselves or how they came to be and what they do to twist the Master's wish. 

Repeat all spoken words and world building questions in the following rounds. 

The Master wishes again trying cunningly to correct the imperfection they repeat the proclamation and make their wish. 

The Genie once again gives their response to the Master's petition, gleefully trying to outwit the Master 

The Master wishes for the final time cajoling for their true intention to be fulfilled - repeating the proclamation, describing and wishing. 

The Genie, considers the threat and responds, to the Master. 

Each then gives an epilogue describing the impact of the wish. 

Change roles and play again.

# Word Warriors

 
```
Requirements: Pen, Paper, a Dictionary 

One player is the GM and the rest are knights of Alphabetia.

Character Creation:

Open to a random dictionary page. Choose a word for your name, and choose an adjective, verb, and noun as your knight's Strengths. 

Sample Character:

My name is Scar.
I am scary,
I can scam,
and I have a scarf.

Mechanics:

The GM describes Alphabetia and knights describe their actions there.

When an actions' outcome is uncertain the GM chooses a number to represent that action's difficulty. The knight rolls 1d6. If the result is above the number they succeed. Otherwise the situation worsens.

If a knight's Strength applies add +1. If it applies perfectly add +2. 

Using a scarf to tie someone up would grant +1. Using it to protect against cold weather would grant +2.

Progression:

In Alphabetia, letters are the building blocks of reality. Overcoming obstacles may cause letters to drop. Knights transform letters into Strengths by spelling words.

Convincing a dragon to stop eating peasants may make HUNGRY drop. A knight may take UNR and gain the Strength to run!

Sample Quests: 

Seek the Synt-Axe: Single swings reshape reality...
March of Minyons: Misspelled monstrosities menace!

# Meadhall Tales

 
```
You are legendary vikings, full of deeds.

Set Up:
Assign d6, d8, d10 to any three skills: sword, dance, weave, craft, drink, skald, etc.
Describe one equipment, which adds +1 to a specific skill.
If you must prove a boast, add equipment and die roll together.
Begin with 1 honor.

Play:
Beginning with the youngest viking, make a boast about a deed: You sliced 5 trolls at once! The minimum boast is the number of vikings. The next viking must make a boast at least 1 bigger: you danced for 6 days straight! or ask the previous viking for proof. All vikings join the boaster or the doubter. The boasters prove their boast together. If they succeed they each narrate their part in the deed and win 1 honor. If they fail, the doubters remind them how they failed and each receive 1 honor instead. Then the next viking begins a new round of boasts.

Spend honor anytime:
1 add +1 to a boast while proving.
3 describe a new equipment.
6 increase a skill to the next higher die.

Play until the mead runs out, or at least until every viking begins one round of boasting.

# Museum: A solo time travel game.

 
```
Go to a museum. An important message waits for you there.

Use all your senses to discern which item in the museum wants to speak to you: Maybe a landscape painting, taxidermied polar bear, Roman coin--anything is possible. This powerful artifact will bring you to another place and time to share the message.

Sit or stand before it. Relax. You might notice a change in temperature or a breeze. New sounds and smells appear. The museum dissolves around you. You are in the place where this item was created, or found. You are inside the painting, on a creaking wooden ship or spending the Roman coin for bread. 

Someone here has a message for you.

What does their voice sound like? What is their name? 

Why have they waited to talk to you? What is their message?

Pay attention: Museum dwellers speak in many voices, but rarely at length. 

What is this new place like? Explore it. 

Now you know something no one else knows. 

Bonus: leave a hint in the museum's guest book.

With friends: Each person should find their own item. Once you have time-travelled, share what you learned (unless, of course, it was a secret.)
