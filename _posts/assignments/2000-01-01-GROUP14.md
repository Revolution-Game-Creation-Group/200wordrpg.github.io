# The Incorrigible Chatterboxes of Dewarhille

 
```
Gather some rumormongers around a table or a front porch with somethin' cold to drink and time to kill.

Y'all are a group of busybodies in the dusty town of Dewarhille. A Stranger has ridden into town of a hot, lazy afternoon, and with nothin' better to do you folk have started in to talkin' as folk are known to do. Share your knowledge of this Stranger and set straight who they are and just what it is they're doin' here.

-Someone ought to start. Favor an eavesdropper who's rarin' to go with some juicy tidbit they picked up at the post office or what have you.
-Start every statement of fact about this Stranger with "Well, I heard..." and then elucidate your companions with the tale you learned and where and from whom you learned it.
-Focus on figurin' out: what they look like; where they came from; why they're here; who knows 'em; what they've been seen doin'; who they've been talkin' with
-By the time you've settled the matter amongst yourselves, the Stranger seems to have moved on and y'all are due to be gettin' home for the day anyway. Them chores won't do themselves.

# Let's Get Paid
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Crime !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are criminals, ready to take a big score. Roll 1d6:
1. Jewelry store
2. Bank
3. Home robbery
4. Blackmail
5. Art theft
6. Assassination

Core Mechanic
You will need d6 of two different colors; designate one color as Cool, and the other as Heat. Each PC starts with one die of each color. Whenever you attempt something, the GM will give a difficulty, 2-6, and you will roll all of your Cool and Heat dice. If any Cool dice are equal to or above the difficulty, you succeed. If any Heat are below, there is a complication. Choose your complication:
-Something bad happens to you, and +1 to your Heat dice
-Something less bad happens to everyone, +1 to Threat Meter
PCs can get more Cool dice by making progress, gathering useful items, or generally being great criminals (GM's discretion). 

Threat Meter
The Threat Meter has 6 segments, and tracks the amount of heat on the heist. Every segment filled should complicate the heist for all of the players (more guards, increased security). If the Threat Meter ever fills up, the cops have shut down the heist, get out of there!

# Backstage

 
```
It is OPENING NIGHT.

The show is a disaster. Your job is to save it.

There are 2-4 DESIGNERS and a STAGE MANAGER (SM). The SM facilitates the game. Each DESIGNER starts with 1 TIELINE.

The DESIGNERS are the: Lighting DESIGNER, Sound DESIGNER, Set DESIGNER, Costume DESIGNER.

Each DESIGNER selects a quirk and then reveals simultaneously. If a quirk is shared, DESIGNERS are (rivals/dating).
     1. Neon hair
     2. Colored clothes
     3. Heavy accent
     4. Band shirt
     5. Coffee drinker
     6. Former actor

Decide the show together. Mockery is encouraged. 
     1. Shakespeare
     2. Musical
     3. Community Theatre
     4. Off-off-Broadway
     5. One-person show
     6. Greek tragedy

The SM (with suggestions from DESIGNERS) narrates the the show. 4+ things go wrong.

When you try to fix something the actors messed up, roll 2d6+TIELINE.

     * On a 10+, it works better than the original. Gain one TIELINE. 
     * On a 7-9, it works, but there's a problem. The SM offers you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
     * On a 6-, it gets a lot worse.

After curtain call, all DESIGNERS vent, and then read the reviews. 

The DESIGNER with most TIELINE is mentioned. The rest are not.

# Judy was Punched
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Domestic abuse, puppets !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are fleeing Punch, the most terrible puppet of all, trying to find a better life away from him.

He has taken your words away.
You can grunt, mime, gesture and babble but not say any words. You will mainly communicate using your hands and hope you are understood.

When you want to attempt a difficult action, play rock paper scissors with the GM.
If you win, you succeed.
If you fail, you suffer a setback.
If you draw, ask "the audience" a question like "Where is he?" or "What did he do to our baby?". This is the only time a player can speak. The GM answers.

To escape Punch, you need to make friends along the way.

GM: Pick 3 characters from this list. Each one will help the player a little bit but may ask for something in return. 
The Policeman
The Crocodile
The Devil
The Doctor
The Executioner
The Clown 

Once the player has been helped by the three characters, they have their words back and the freedom to exit into the audience. Or they can choose to stay and battle Punch, finally finding the strength to fight back. 

At long last, the choice is theirs.

# One Thousand Cuts

 
```
A game for a handful of players without a GM.

-

You are telling the story of friendships that span lives. Scenes can be years or decades apart.

-

Together, decide what kind of world your story is set in - realistic, fantasy, sci-fi...

-

Each name your character. Each write on your arm your character's:

- Wildest dream
- Grandest plan
- Greatest fear
- Biggest regret

Number these traits 1-4 in a random, personal order.

-

Rotate between different pairs of players in individual scenes, prioritising pairs who've not yet played together. Roll 2d4 for the setting.

- familiar
- unknown
- dangerous
- safe

- home
- business
- transportation
- wilderness

-

Before playing the scene, play rock-paper-scissors. Whoever loses will lose a trait by the end of the scene. Traits are lost in number order.

Narrate and role-play the scene, revealing how the friendship made them surrender their dream, abandon their plan, overcome their fear, or cast off their regret. 

At the end of the scene, completely cover the lost trait with a plaster/band-aid. Write the other character's name on the plaster.

-

Keep playing until everyone's arms are covered in plasters bearing the names of those who shaped them. Consider how different the characters are to when you began.

The Leader then describes what they see according to the adjectives they rolled.

e.g. Disgusting + Useful = skeleton key made from human bones
Hostile + Unique = angry albino zebra

Doubles mean the opposite of the adjective rolled.

+1 xp when you overcome significant danger or when your Trait interferes with the party's interests.
Spend 1xp to add +1 to resolution roll, 1xp to reroll 1 Kuleshov die, 5xp for new Skill.

GM has final say on all disputes.
