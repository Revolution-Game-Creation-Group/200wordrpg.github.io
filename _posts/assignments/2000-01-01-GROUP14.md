# The Incorrigible Chatterboxes of Dewarhille

 
```
Gather some rumormongers around a table or a front porch with somethin' cold to drink and time to kill.

Y'all are a group of busybodies in the dusty town of Dewarhille. A Stranger has ridden into town of a hot, lazy afternoon, and with nothin' better to do you folk have started in to talkin' as folk are known to do. Share your knowledge of this Stranger and set straight who they are and just what it is they're doin' here.

-Someone ought to start. Favor an eavesdropper who's rarin' to go with some juicy tidbit they picked up at the post office or what have you.
-Start every statement of fact about this Stranger with "Well, I heard..." and then elucidate your companions with the tale you learned and where and from whom you learned it.
-Focus on figurin' out: what they look like; where they came from; why they're here; who knows 'em; what they've been seen doin'; who they've been talkin' with
-By the time you've settled the matter amongst yourselves, the Stranger seems to have moved on and y'all are due to be gettin' home for the day anyway. Them chores won't do themselves.

# Heavy Words

 
```
#mood
A dark cloud floats above your head... the desire you've left drifts away from your body. You try to move, but your limbs don't respond to your commands.
You're somehow trapped inside your own mind. To set yourself free you need to find the word that keeps you prisoner.

#setup
One of the players will be the "Word Keeper" [WK]. The other(s) will be "Prisoner(s)"
Each Prisoner picks a stone. They write on its surface a word with meaning.

#gameplay
Wk is responsible for:
*Creating the world and filling the scenario with surrealism
*Setting obstacles to prisoners
*Asking the prisoners some questions (specially "what do you do?")

Prisoners: 
*Play to escape reality and surpass WK's obstacles by answering the questions they are addressed
*Can't show the written word to other players
*Can't say their own written word! 

#end
While playing, if WK says the Prisoner's word, the stone is shown and the word is revealed.
Prisoner shows the importance of that word to him (by telling a flashback episode).
WK ends the narrative (by telling how that word sets the prisoner free).
The stone is thrown away as far as it can and the game is over.

# The Antarctic Expedition

 
```
A GM-less horror storygame for 2 to 5 players. You are members of an expedition to Antarctica and discover an eon-old artifact in a cave a dozen metres below the ice. What will happen to you?

The Setting
Decide on the era, your gear and the actual goal of the expedition. Prompts: undiscovered local tribe, Victorian British explorers, modern-day scientists, visitors from another planet

Your characters
Each player describes their character in a few words, revealing their calling and discernible personality. Additionally, they privately decide how their character benefits from the expedition. 

The game
Decide as a group how the expedition went so far. Prompts: losses, weird findings or encounters,  uneventful

What does the artifact look like? Does it react to you finding it? Does anything change? 

You have a few in-game hours to interact with the artifact and find out what happens. After each hour the artifact, your surroundings or you will exhibit a dramatic transformation--what is it? At the end of the last hour everybody describes a short epilogue for their character and where they finally end up after the expedition.

If anybody died, hold a moment of silence for them.

# Song Duel

 
```
You are a second year student at the Bardic College, having learned many of the magical songs of your craft. Like many of your fellows you congregate after class at the Sodden Badger Inn, to practice the ancient art of Song Dueling.

How to Play:

You have to have a way to stream songs upon demand, such as a phone, or Alexa. Pair off with your opponent and begin.

Flip a coin to see who goes first. Whoever is the attacker chooses a song, begins to play it, and spends some time describing the nature of the spell they are casting. When the song is done, the defender gets to cast their counter-song. They too play a song, describing how the spell takes effect. These are all illusions; no direct damage is ever done.

The rest of the players then vote on the winner of the round. The best of three rounds wins.

Example: Jim plays Peace Sells by Megadeath, describing a field of illusionary warriors marching along, etc. Beth, on her turn, plays For Whom the Bell Tolls by Metallica, and describes a scene of Death slaying the soldiers, etc. Everyone votes for Beth. Repeat.

# Crimson
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: blood, inhumanity !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>

Crimson
by Jeeyon Shim

Crimson is a solitaire game. Duration of play is silent. Do not let yourself be seen by anyone during any stage of play, especially the endgame.

Play it when you bleed accidentally (e.g. a paper cut).




You are a homunculus. You have been in the world for a week and a day. The magician who created you died yesterday, and your skeleton is still turning from wood to bone, your veins still run with water slowly turning to blood. 



Put a small piece of white gauze on the cut. Watch the blood bloom through the cloth.



The bleeding is a sure sign that you are transforming. 



Put the bloodied gauze in a small brown paper box.



What makes you human? Write it on the outside of the box.



What keeps you from being completely human? Write it on the inside of the box.





Which do you commit to?

HUMAN: If you commit to being human, find a tree and bury the box with your blood in the dirt by its roots.

HOMUNCULUS: If you commit to being inhuman, throw the box with your blood into a fire and watch it as it burns to ash.

# When the world ends

 
```
You are a group of three to four researchers at a remote location (describe) to save the world. Discuss the nature of the issue to be solved. Each researcher secretly choses one of the following words:

FAME
PRESSURE
SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS
BOASTING
SOCIAL CONTACTS
RELATIONSHIP

This is the real reason you're here. Flesh out your character.

The game is divided in four scenes, in which players take turns as the lead researcher. During each scene: roll a six-sided die, consult the table below and narrate how your characters proposes a solution. Let other players react in character.

1-2: A quick fix, which doesn't solve anything.
3-4: An expensive fix which has no support.
4-6: A good fix which introduces a bigger issue.
7: A great fix which will ensure public outrage.
8: The perfect fix at the expense of half of the world population.

A player may opt to show her/his real objective to add 2 to the die roll. Narrate how the personal issue affects the solution.
Play ends with a vote (own solution is excepted). When you showed your objective, your vote doubles. Ties mean no solution is approved. Narrate together how the world ends.

# Rendezvous
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Heartache/emotionally heavy !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
To be played by two people, apart, who miss each other.
You once shared intimacy but haven't met in some time. Roll or decide:

How you were: quiet, desperate, transactional, awkward, cozy
Why you parted: growth, necessity, ambition, accident, death
What you can't talk about: loss, family, transition, betrayal, future
Where you meet now: the usual caf√©; the agreed-upon rendezvous point; the beach at night; the backyard of a house owned by one of you; a faraway airport 

Take turns describing something around you. What is it? What does it look, sound, feel like? How did it get here? Why does it catch your eye?

When something is described to you, it prompts you to (choose one):

Segue into a compliment
Describe a shared memory
Say something once left unsaid
Suggest something to do together
Close the distance between you
Avoid an unpleasant topic 

Once you choose, neither of you can react this way again. Now, you describe something. Repeat.

When all reactions are exhausted, decide privately whether you want to leave together or separately. Reveal your decisions. If you agree, describe the weight that has left your shoulders. If you disagree, describe who leaves and how.
