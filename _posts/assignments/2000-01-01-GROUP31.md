# SWEAT TEARS BLOOD
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Four or more players are duelists, come for the final showdown. You have three moves. Go clockwise and name your move, then follow the instructions.

SWEAT: Describe your environment. How does the sand blow in the wind? How does the sun beat down on you? How does your weapon feel at your hip?
Take a red d6.

TEARS: Look another duelist in the eyes and establish a moment from your shared past. What were you, before? Friends? Family? Lovers? Linger on that moment, that time before now. Don't explain what went wrong- they already know.
Take two black d6es.

BLOOD: Look a duelist you have an established past with in the eyes, then they explain why you're wrong. I didn't know. You don't understand. It's not my fault. 
Then shoot them. You roll all your red dice and they roll all their black dice. If any values match across colors, both duelists recover all their dice of those values. Then, discard any remaining black dice and put any remaining red dice in front of the shot duelist.

If you have three or more red dice in front of you, speak your last words, then die.

Only one duelist can leave.

# Vile Villains
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
1 GM, 3 Evil Players. 
---
If you have 0 HP at turn start, roll a d6. On a 1, you die. HP can't go negative.

At combat start, roll a d6 + HP, going highest -> lowest for turn order.

To attack (1 attack per turn), roll a d6 against a target within range ('target:') they roll too. If you roll lower, nothing happens. Otherwise, you damage it.

You can move 30ft per turn.
---
Players:

-Deathknight. HP 5. You have a sword (3 damage, target: within 5ft). When it kills, you regain 1 lost HP.

-Blasphemer. HP 4. You have magic gifted from a god (2 damage, target: sight). You can heal 2 lost HP to a target you can see in addition to attacking, you must kill to heal again.

-Necromancer. HP 3. You have innate magic (1 damage + 1 curse, target: sight). You make a friendly zombie by touching a corpse instead of attacking.

    Curses:
      - Next attack automatically hits it.
      - Next attempted attack does double damage against it.
      - Subtract 2 from its next attack roll
---
GM: 

Enemies have statistics formatted like players, with unique attacks. Example:

   Zombie. HP 1. The zombie bites (1 damage, target: within 5ft).

# The Kid From Utah

 
```
The Kid from Utah
A game of awkward teenage interactions
Requires: 4 players, pens, index cards, a coin

Instructions:
- Choose one player to be the Kid, a robot who looks exactly like a human teenager.  Something's gone wrong, so the Kid's creators dumped them in generic modern suburbia but botched the memory deletion routine.

- Label four cards "Personal," "Social," "Culture," and "Other."  Each player writes one memory on each card, e.g. "I have six siblings," "girls/boys like it when you them ask a lot of questions," "<band> is so cool."  Give them to the Kid.

- Together, choose (1) a scene location, such as a coffee shop or the locker room after gym class; (2) 1+ players to play through a scene with the Kid; (3) a role for the scene partner(s), such as a teacher or another teen.

- Kid, your cover story is that you're from Utah.  However, you know nothing about Utah.  Do what you can with your limited memories and wits and go make friends.

- Play your scene.  Afterward, flip the coin for each card.  If the coin is heads, scrap the card and make one with new memories.

- Play more scenes until you're done.

# Falling Down
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```

You are a middle-aged man or woman frustrated with your work and passing by a very difficult problem. And the last bad thing that happens to you will be the last straw, making you lose control.

Choose a profession, a personal problem and something that irritates you a lot.

Your rage die starts at 1. Whenever you perform an action, roll 2d6 and add the value of your rage die: 1-6 you fail; 7-9 you get success at a cost; 10-12 you get a success.

Whenever you encounter a situation that irritates you, roll 1d6. If the result is greater than the current number of your rage die, add 1 to your rage die. If it's something related to your profession, personal problem, or what irritates you a lot, add 2 to the rage die instead. When you reach 6, you lose control and commit unbridled violence.

Your police-chased die starts at 1. Whenever you do something violent, roll 1d6. If the result is greater than the current value of your police-chased die, add 1 to it. When you reach 6, the police find you and you are captured.

# Heist Aches

 
```
You're a group of hustlers out to take every penny from a rival's casino.

Create 4 traits describing your character (sexy, brawny, marksman). Write down one useful thing (hacker friend, hidden gun) and keep it secret. When revealed, this Ace in the Hole automatically succeeds one relevant task. Players begin with 5 poker chips and their own deck of cards.

Everyone names one area of the casino with something valuable. GM plans some unknown locations, valuables, and security. Discuss heist plans.

Begin heist. When attempting something, draw a card and play up to five cards. GM draws 1-5 cards, depending on the difficulty, and plays up to five cards. Reveal cards simultaneously. A better poker hand than the GM means success. 

Draw an extra card for each relevant trait. After resolving actions, keep a hand of up to 5 cards. Reshuffle your cards when there are none left to draw, or when you play your entire hand.

If an action fails, lose a chip. If you succeed an action by playing the same number of cards as the GM, gain a chip (maximum of 7). If you lose all your chips, you are caught. They're high stakes, after all.

# Persist - A 200 Word RPG

 
```
This game is best used with the X Card. Players are free to leave at any time.

Players sit around a table with pens and paper, and smile. On a sheet of paper, write your character's name, a description, their current state, five truths they hold about themselves, and five talents they have.  

Introduce your character to the group. Try to do this in character. Keep smiling.

Players should decide now what is off limits, if anything. Don't put things off limits if possible.

Situations will happen to the characters, progressing along the following scale:

A problem
A crisis
A disaster
A calamity

For each event, pass your character sheet to the left (clockwise) to a person who hasn't yet written on your sheet, if possible.

Have the player write down what happens to your character and cross out a talent, before passing the sheet back. 

Write down how your character responds to the event, using at least one of the remaining talents written on your sheet. Cross out a truth the character holds about themselves before passing the sheet. Keep smiling.

After the last phase, tell each other what happened to you, and what you lost. Keep smiling.
