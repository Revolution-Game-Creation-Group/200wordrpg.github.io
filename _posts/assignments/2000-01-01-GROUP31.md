# SWEAT TEARS BLOOD
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Four or more players are duelists, come for the final showdown. You have three moves. Go clockwise and name your move, then follow the instructions.

SWEAT: Describe your environment. How does the sand blow in the wind? How does the sun beat down on you? How does your weapon feel at your hip?
Take a red d6.

TEARS: Look another duelist in the eyes and establish a moment from your shared past. What were you, before? Friends? Family? Lovers? Linger on that moment, that time before now. Don't explain what went wrong- they already know.
Take two black d6es.

BLOOD: Look a duelist you have an established past with in the eyes, then they explain why you're wrong. I didn't know. You don't understand. It's not my fault. 
Then shoot them. You roll all your red dice and they roll all their black dice. If any values match across colors, both duelists recover all their dice of those values. Then, discard any remaining black dice and put any remaining red dice in front of the shot duelist.

If you have three or more red dice in front of you, speak your last words, then die.

Only one duelist can leave.

# My Lunch with Senator Andre

 
```
Premise:
It's time to eat. You want to go somewhere, but you are also with a group. If you admit you only want Baja Blast they may think less of you, so it's time to lie and connive and make them think they decided on getting that sweet sweet blue liquid. 

Don't ever admit what you really want.

Don't ever make compromises.

PREPARATION:
Write down 3 aspects of the restaurant you want to go to:
one foodstuff such as "serves hummus"
one aesthetic  such as" goofy shit on the walls"
one vibe such as "awkwardly horny"

Keep 2, and put the other in a hat. Everyone playing will draw another aspect from the hat. 

Now write what you consider the antithesis of the restaurant you want to go to. Horny Hardee's, for example, is the antithesis of chaste Red Lobster. This is your Veto card.

VOTING:
A vote must be proposed and seconded before voting starts.

A majority vote will end the game unless it gets hit with a Veto card.

CONCLUSION:
If you don't get everything you have ever wanted; you lose. 

You have 10 minutes. Agree on lunch or you must go to Taco Bell

# THE SUN A WIDE-EYED PHOENIX IN ITS NEST
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: fictional animal slaughter !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
For one player.

Retha's community sucked its land dry. But, according to myth, if Retha slaughters the phoenix that wanders daytime skies, life will be restored.

Retha has an axe, a pair of wax wings, a breastplate, and no better ideas. They're currently hanging from the phoenix's talons.

As they act, roll six dice. If they used a tool, choose any numbers, then reroll all dice showing those numbers.

SCALING THE PHOENIX
If you didn't roll a...
    1: Retha falls off and plummets.
    2: Retha can't climb higher.
    3-4: There's no opportunity to strike.
    5: Sacrifice a tool.
    6: Retha's crushed, near-lethally.

STRIKING THE HEAD
Roll only three dice if you have no weapon. If you didn't roll...
    two 1-2s: Retha fall off and plummet.
    four odds/evens: Sacrifice a tool.
    two 6s: Retha can't make wounds last.

CHEATING DEATH
If you didn't roll a...
    1: The phoenix cries, anguished.
    2: We remember Retha as naive.
    3: We remember Retha as gullible.
    4: We remember Retha as weak.
    5: Retha cannot cheat death. (The game ends.)
    6: The myth is fake.

After two wounds, the phoenix plummets, a fallen star. Is life restored?

# Pisa D Action

 
```
Do you like rolling tons of dice? Do you build dice towers, waiting for your turn in tabletop RPGs? Do you own a giant sack of dice? What if there was a way to make a game of that? 

In this game, each player is an intrepid explorer, researching the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This tower has many floors, and you discover that each floor is actually a battle arena. Can you fight all the way to the top?

Roll a 'handful of dice' to determine the number of floors. Each floor is a boss fight. 

This game uses dice towers. To determine damage dealt, the player builds a tower made of assorted dice. Once that tower falls, the players collect the dice used and roll those to determine their damage. 

Objective: See how many bosses you can beat. No healing between floors. 
Boss Health: Each player (including GM) builds a dice tower and adds everything together.
Player Health: Some arbitrarily large number.  Like 10,000 + a player-made dice tower.

To save time, build your dice towers at the same time. GM builds one for the boss.

Keep scoreboard for tallest tower and most damage dealt!

Maybe use a tray ... cool.

# Fools on a Journey
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: tarot !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
materials: a tarot deck

-------
-setup-
-------

collectively choose a setting.
deal out the minor arcana.
make a deck of the major arcana (in order).

everyone plays a card, describing their character and allegiance.
[cups: emotion; swords: reason; wands: creativity; pentacles: wealth]
note your allies.

if multiple cards have the same value, discard them and any others of that value.
players who played uniquely take all four cards of that value.

based on cards played/lost, establish your characters/relationships.

whoever played the highest-value unique card leads. [aces are high-value]

------
-play-
------

the leader reveals the next major arcanum, and describes the challenge it represents.
they play a card representing their leadership.

everyone else chooses a card, then simultaneously either:
- reveals it
- takes it back
- gives it to someone else

if the total of the numbers played equals the major arcanum's number, you succeed - if they differ by 1 or 2, you succeed partially.
[court cards have no number, aces are 1]

whoever played the highest-value card following suit places the major arcanum before them, discarding the other cards. 
they become the leader, and describe how the challenge resolved.

------------
-conclusion-
------------

after 22 rounds, note where the cards ended up. 
how have you changed?

# Wherefore

 
```
A game of strong constitutions, for several players.
 
Together, establish scale:  Nations?  People?  Cats?  Ants?
 
Each describe your own purpose.  A single sentence, perhaps two.  This is your raison d'Ãªtre.  Your "Wherefore".
 
Divide six points between Original Intent, and Flexible Interpretation.
 
Together, describe your relationships, ambitions, and plots.  Make up actions you might take until some action is contentious.

Other players decide if you are acting within the intent of your stated purpose.  If so, roll against the value of your intent.  Otherwise, against Flexibility.  If needed, you act as the tie breaker.

If you roll equal or under, you have the presence and purpose necessary for success.  Good job.
 
If you roll over, you lack the focus, clarity of intent, or will to be successful.  Maybe you didn't try hard enough, prepare enough, or want it enough.

Choose the reason for your failure.  This becomes a defining quality of your character, and colors the way others interact with you.
 
Record any success or failure as precedent.  A majority of the players may cite precedent to declare that you automatically succeed or fail in any similar endeavor you attempt in the future.  If needed, you may be a tie breaker.
