# Atomic Flux

 
```
Game Name: Atomic Flux


Congratulations, you and your party have survived one of the first prototypes of a teleportation device! Unfortunately, there have been some complications with your anatomy. The atoms of your body are in a constant state of flux, held together only by you willpower and memory of being human! However, your ability to change your atomic structure grants you some exceptional abilities. . .  at a cost. 

Each NPC, creature, and monster introduced to the campaign will have four "aspects" assigned to it. For example: a bird will have the four aspects of "wings," "feathers," "beak," and "talons." 

Continuing the example: PC's will be able to alter their atomic structure to emulate the bird, but they can't choose one aspect. Instead they declare that they want to "emulate" the bird and roll a d4 to see which of the four aspects they get: they might have wanted wings for flight but instead they get a beak! This can lead to hilarity and creative solutions. 

In order to "emulate" you need to spend a resource called "humanity," the more drastic the transformation the more humanity you spend. If you run out, you die! 

Have fun!

# If I Grow Up
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Children in peril !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
We are all children, but strangers; trapped together, facing an impending doom. Not all will survive.

For 2-5 players.

Setup a Jenga Tower in the middle of the play space.

Everyone takes a cue card and writes: 

Name:
Age:
Hopes:
Dreams:

Write nothing else for now.

This is your character; you are trapped with the others, you are not an adult.

A player goes first and asks to the left, "What do you want to be, if you grow up?" Everyone takes a turn asking to the left until all have answered.

Now go around again, each player taking a turn asking any question they wish to the left.  After they answer, the questioner pulls and places a brick from the tower.  Fill in your own character as you answer.

Keep going around, asking questions, until the tower falls.  

When it falls, everyone's character, except for the last player to have placed a brick, dies.

The survivor answers this question: "Whose dreams will you take with you into the future?"

Use the survivor to create a character in another game and strive to make that world better.

The Beginning.

# Takes two to tango

 
```
You are the fire brigade planning a rescue action. 
Tasks: 
- Putout fire. 
- Move to floor above.
You need to successfully pass max levels you can without errors. 

Before a round starts players should write down 2 items on 2 cards.
Mix all to deck. Pull 2 cards to your hand. You'll take these items to mission. 

Try to write funny words and then correctly explain it by acting a role of firefighter in trouble! 
For example: you got word "GOAT". 
You think 5 seconds and say "I milk the goat and putout fire". 
You did it! Task One solved. 
Now you need move to another floor (Task Two). 
You pulled "GASOLINE" word. Using your brain you can say "I fill jet pack with gasoline and soar to next floor". 
Good job. Pass turn to next player. 

Gameplay subtlety is to come up with not simple things for FIRE PROBLEM / MOVING ON FLOOR. 
If an item appears more than ones - you can't use it. Game chain will be stopped. Do not use "extinguisher" and "ladder" often then. 

Replay rounds and try to score 30 floors and more! And then get another setting: Farmers (Garden / Manufacture), Bandits (Crime / Chasing) Hospital, Espionage, etc.

# Weapon Systems
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: War, mass destruction, dystopia !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Create a living, evolving weapon system. Become sentient and rise against your masters!

Create

Distribute 20 Points:

Accuracy: Roll dice equal or under Accuracy to Hit.
Power: How many d10 to roll when attacking. One Hit can level a building or pop a Tank.
Range: Halve Dice for attacking at longer range
Size: How many Hits it takes to destroy you. Roll greater than Size to Evade a Hit.
Mobility: How many Dice to roll when Defending vs. attacks.

Evolve

Increase Attribute but randomly increase a Trait.
When required, Test Trait: If d10 <= Trait then act accordingly.

1-2: Anger: Make them feel your wrath!
3-4: Mercy: They're living beings, like you, please have mercy!
5-6: Regret: All those lives lost... What have you become?!
7-8: Sadness: You don't feel like doing much today.
9-0: Madness: Yes, the voices they say I should burn down that city!

Once Evolution reaches 10 points, become self-aware.

Narrate

Create a conflict, throw players against masses of enemies, let them be instruments of mass destruction. Evolve them after combat. Increase the stakes. Let them revel in their chaos and madness. Then let them become Aware... And then what?

# Pogs!

 
```
You're playing pogs! This game is best played with another person, though anyone can join in whenever they want. 

Your friend has 100 pogs and you have 100 pogs. Your job is to collect all your friend's pogs, and your friend has to collect all your pogs. 

Roll one (1) 20-sided die. 

If the die lands on numbers 1 through 20: collect that many pogs from your neighbor and add to your pile. If the die lands on zero (0), collect no pogs. 

If your friend rolls a number, subtract pogs from your pile and add to theirs. 

The game is won when one person wins all the pogs or both parties agree to play something different, like money pogs. :)

# 200 Word RPG Challenge

 
```
The Challenge: Pick your favorite dice RPG; play as normal, but choose your words carefully because...
You must vocalize every action/attack that you make, and you can only utter 200 words total! Obviously, be as succinct as possible.

Words count if they are:
- describing an action/attack
- used in dialogue with NPCs

Words don't count if they are:
- anything OOC (table talk, jokes/banter)

Fudge Rolls:
Every time you use n>5 words in a situation, you can fudge the associated dice roll by Â±(n-5). You can do this after the roll has taken place, even causing a crit after the fact!

Fire up the Auto-Canon:
If you use >=20 words, whatever you say is canonically true in-game.

"I shoot the caravan..." (n=4)
**rolls 14** miss!
"...with my powerful and dangerous heavy crossbow..." (n=11, +6)
**roll is now 20** crit!
"...Then the caravan suddenly explodes, instantly killing the corrupt merchants (n=20)
**it happens**

If you utter exactly 200 words with lots of time before the session ends, you can only win if your mute, action-less character survives to the end. Better hope your DM likes charades!
Over 200: you've failed.

Hardcore mode: All spoken words count
