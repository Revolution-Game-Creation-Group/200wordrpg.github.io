# Atomic Flux

 
```
Game Name: Atomic Flux


Congratulations, you and your party have survived one of the first prototypes of a teleportation device! Unfortunately, there have been some complications with your anatomy. The atoms of your body are in a constant state of flux, held together only by you willpower and memory of being human! However, your ability to change your atomic structure grants you some exceptional abilities. . .  at a cost. 

Each NPC, creature, and monster introduced to the campaign will have four "aspects" assigned to it. For example: a bird will have the four aspects of "wings," "feathers," "beak," and "talons." 

Continuing the example: PC's will be able to alter their atomic structure to emulate the bird, but they can't choose one aspect. Instead they declare that they want to "emulate" the bird and roll a d4 to see which of the four aspects they get: they might have wanted wings for flight but instead they get a beak! This can lead to hilarity and creative solutions. 

In order to "emulate" you need to spend a resource called "humanity," the more drastic the transformation the more humanity you spend. If you run out, you die! 

Have fun!

# Congratulations on your Planet!

 
```
Congratulations!

[PLANET NAME HERE]'s construction is nearing completion, so we've gathered you all to begin evaluation. Most architects work independently, so you may need to introduce yourselves and your areas of expertise. Your individual experiences with the clients may need to be shared as well.

Corporate has created a prototype orbital tracking analysis topographical object, or POTATO. One of you should have the POTATO with you. It is a miniature version of the planet you have been working on all this time.

Analyze the POTATO. Each architect should specify which locations they are most proud of. Does it differ from your home planet? If you have any grievances with other architects, now may be the time to air them. Please let us know if there is anything on the POTATO that you feel was misrepresented, and feel free to mark the POTATO as such.

We only have time left to make one major change to [PLANET NAME HERE], so please inform us what you have agreed upon as the most important fix for the planet. Altering the POTATO to match might be a helpful visual aid.

Best Wishes,
Starch Industries Board of Directors

They thought you were sleeping when they implanted the thing in your head. 

Who? Why? Is it dangerous?

A bundle of clues sits on your nightstand. Who could have left it?
There's a note in a code you understand: "If you want to know, find out why you don't want to go" followed by several numbers. There's a one-day bus pass and directions to the nearest bus stop.

Make your clues using numbers from a fortune cookie, or from gaming dice. 

When you have plenty of time, take a pen, the bus pass and clues to the bus stop and start your investigation.

Take notes in code.

What makes you want to avoid going where you'll find the answers?
Who wouldn't want you in these places? 
Why do they want you to stay away?
Is "common sense safety" just the aversion effect of your implant?
The numbers will take you to places you don't want to go.  Are they bus routes, the number of stops you should ride, numbers you'll recognize in clues, street addresses of important places? 

When you've solved the mystery, will you return home, or will what you learn change everything?

This game needs a GM and two or more players. 

A world is being devastated. The GM explains how, and what can save it. The players are in charge of saving as much as possible.

Each player chooses a name, role, and three people, principles, or things that are important to them. The GM starts a secret tracker. Play begins.

The GM creates a disaster and says who or what it will doom. Any player may sacrifice something important to stop it, explaining how. If no one does, the GM records what is lost and adds 1 to the tracker. If someone does, the GM records what was saved and adds d4 to the tracker. The GM then names the next disaster.

When the tracker reaches (Players x4), the GM gives an update on the end of the world. When the tracker reaches (Players x7), the GM explains how the players have almost won. When the tracker reaches (Players x8), the disasters end.

The GM explains what was lost and what was saved. Each player explains what their place in the new world is, and what their sacrifices left them with.

Decide if the result was worth the cost.

# Larks at St. Agnes

 
```
One of you is Headmaster/mistress at a British boarding school in 1902. The rest of you are mischievous students planning a prank. With at least five players, one student is the Secret Swot (wants to help the Head). Privately assign roles with playing cards and only the Head announces their role.

SETUP
Pens, paper, phone, d6.


PHASES (Repeat 1-2 N times with N players.)

1. Morning Prayers:
Head announces a distinguished guest will visit (name and title of guest, why they're coming). State time and location of at least three events (e.g. speech, award ceremony, banquet). May change/reorder one event each round.

(Objective: Students plan a coordinated prank to spoil the visit.)

2. Recitation:
Head calls one student to perform a reading. Topic must be appropriate (e.g. Romantic poets, British history, Thucydides) Others may only pass notes. Roll d6 when passing a note. If 1, Head intercepts and confiscates it.

3. Visit:
All privately write down prank roles. Head announces finalized agenda of visit. Players read prank roles. Did it work?

DEMERITS
If caught talking or passing notes, or with bad posture, a student gets one demerit. With two demerits, no more passing/reading notes!

# Awakened

 
```
The earth is dying. The oceans are boiling. Life is out of options. 

And so, you have awakened.

All of you will, as a group or in turn, describe what you are. You need not be the same.

Then you will describe why and how you will save the planet. How do you come together as one?

You will set out tasks, goals, challenges. What must you overcome?

As you tell this story, and embody your awakened, there will be times when it's unclear whether or not you can do something. In those moments, you'll draw one card from a single, shuffled deck. 
 
Ace: No, and / You don't do it, and something even worse happens.
2-4: No, but / You don't do it, but somehow you're helped forward
5-8: Yes, but / You do it, but you're worse for wear
9-Jack: You do it.
Queen, King. Yes, and / It goes even better than you'd imagined.

Odds are better when you work together. If working together on an action, you each draw a card, and the highest determines the result above.

Your story ends when the planet is saved, or when all is lost.

# Magnum Opus

 
```
Requires:
Minor Arcana. 
Three coins per Alchemist.
D6s

One player is the King, the rest are Alchemists. Each alchemist seeks to gain the King's favor so that they can create their Magnum Opus.

The Alchemists must first choose their goal.

Power- Swords 
Health- Cups 
Knowledge- Wands 
Wealth- Coins 

Every great work has four stages. Each stage:

Each Alchemist presents the next stage of their work to the King.

Then, the other Alchemists may offer their objections. After all objections, the speaker may respond. 

Once all Alchemists have presented, the King distributes the coins based on his relative trust in each project. The Alchemists then draw a card for every coin.

After the fourth stage, the Alchemists reveal their cards that match their goal suit. Next, the Alchemists take turns attempting to debunk their opponents. 

An Alchemist may spend one of their remaining cards to explain why one of their opponent's creations doesn't work. If the King is swayed, the Alchemist may remove one of that opponent's cards. 

When no Alchemist has cards to spend, each Alchemist adds up the point values of their revealed cards.  Whichever Alchemist ends with the highest number of points has created their Magnum Opus.
