# An Odd Little Town

 
```
Basic Premise
This game is played with a GM, 2-6 players, and a handful of six-sided dice. Players are citizens of a small town in the middle of nowhere. Establish how they all know each other. Strange things are beginning to happen in town, and they are going to be tangled up in it.

Inciting Incident
1 Murder
2 Disappearance
3 Appearance
4 Sighting
5 Strange Behavior
6 Dreams

Resolving Uncertainty
When a player takes action, and the result is unclear, they roll a die. They can get extra dice in a few ways:

-Possess a significant advantage
-Work together with others
-Trigger a new Oddity

Take the highest die, and interpret the results:
1-3: No, And (Failure, things get worse.)
4: No, But (Failure, a bright side.)
5: Yes, But (Success, with a catch.)
6: Yes, And (Success, things get better.)

Oddities
Endless hallways. Strange creatures in the woods. Creepy strangers on the side of the road. As the players dig up the secrets of their town, reality unravels, and the world becomes more like a dream, or a nightmare. Some are innocuous new neighbors, some are deadly monsters. Oddities are permanent, they will snowball over time.

```
you sit on the limit of everything, legs dangling over the edge;
you've done this before.
planets & worlds
torn & sundered again and again 
your hands bloodied & left full in the aftermath. 

what was it like this time? 

[roll d4s and tell the story of the place you devastated.]

when you arrived, it was:
- a quiet place
- already ruined
- raucous & beautiful
- simply a place; that's all that matters

you held it: 
- dear
- without regard
- fond enough
- with disdain

its population:
- was trusting
- never let you into their fold
- allowed you to orbit them
- loved you 

its downfall was:
- slow and unsteady
- chaotic
- unexpected
- an orchestrated process

its destruction was:
- choice
- consequence
- necessary
- accidental
 
did you love someone there?:
- it's inevitable that you always do
- not this time
- just this once
- you wouldn't dare 

what did you gain from this all?:
- little
- everything
- nothing 
- something, but whatever it was, it wasn't worth it

and then, when it's gone:

what's next?
- you go on, you suppose
- a repetition
- there's no choice but to continue this 
- no rest for the wicked (or for the divine)

[turns pass to left. If alone, doom another world or pause your path of ruination]

# Best Friend Spruce
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: self-destructive behavior, being ignored, watching a loved one struggle !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are a tree and your best friend is a human. She talks to you, confides in you, even touches you. Jenny tells you things she tells no one else and she loves you. You talk to her too, of course-You soothe and advise her, because you care deeply about Jenny-She just can't hear you. At least, she sure doesn't listen.

[Go to a bad advice site like answers.yahoo.com and read the first question that engages you.]

Listen to Jenny. Empathize with her. Offer her solace. Answer her questions and give her the advice she asks for.

[Read the first response to that question that suggests a possible course of action. Jenny leaves (how long?) and does that.]

Wait until she returns to learn how things have developed for your human friend. She never ever takes your advice, and you watch things go from bad to worse for her, but you never stop caring.

[Imagine how things went for Jenny. Your worst realistic imagining is exactly what happened.]

Your presence soothes her. It feels good.

Then she asks you something new.

[Find another question on the site, in a related category. Repeat until one of you passes on.]

# Dappled History

 
```
Gather: a blank map, drawing tools, at least yourself

Whoever last built something goes first.

On your turn choose 1:


- Add something to the map. It can be as small as a pebble or as big as a mountain. It could be a fence post or a fence, a tree or a forest. Just make sure that you leave room for others.

Tell us about the history or significance of what you added. A story, a memory, a fact, a rumour.


(After 2 rounds.)


- Introduce a character. Draw a symbol that represents them near a place they hangout. Tell us what they look like and a little about who they are.


- Add a new hangout for an existing character, with consent from whoever introduced them. Draw their symbol nearby and tell us a story they have of this place, and how they relate to it.


- Ask the group if they want to describe a story two or more characters with nearby symbols share and how they relate to each other. If everyone isn't on board, do something else.



When you run out of room or time, or grow tired or restless, give this place a name together and end play.

# Muses - Stories Generator

 
```
Everyone has a story to tell, or so the saying goes... Then, how come you - a Writer [player one] cannot come up with even a single tale? You've searched your heart, scoured your soul, poked at your mind and there's nothing. So, you shout and curse all of the gods.

As an answer, lightning strikes and your Muses [other players - up to seven of them] are made manifest! Silently, each of them draws up a paper at random, with the following topics.

Setting|	|Characters	|Plot	|Conflict	|Theme	|Point-of-View		|Tone

[The Muses must fill the topics with additional content, for example, the Setting can be post-apocalyptic fantasy, Characters - a sentient snail, the Plot - the suns have died and everyone must find shelter in the underground; etc.]

Thus, your prayers are answered! But the gods made you work for your new masterpiece. You must spin a tale based on the topics and content provided by the Muses. [If there are fewer than seven Muses, you must come up with content!] You have moments to prepare [~5 minutes] and little time [~20 minutes] to tell the tale.

Once done, one of the Muses becomes the Writer and the cycle begins anew.

```
You and up to three friends are Suitors on an adventure to be the very best. To win game suitor must win a challenge (as challenger) with at least 30 experience points (exp). You can only have up to 35 exp and up to three captured suitimons. When deck is exhausted reshuffle the discard.


Type Chart:
Strong to>That
Spades>Hearts>Club>Diamond>Spades


Attacking:
To attack draw two cards, add values (face cards are five), and then modifiers: Plus two for each card strong against target. Minus two if weak. You may replace an attack card with a captured suitimon.


Suitors take one action per turn:

*Encounter a wild suitimon (draw a card) and do one of the following:

**Battle it by preforming an attack of at least ten to win exp in the amount of suitimon's value, otherwise you lose the exp. Must have a suitimon to battle.

**Capture it by drawing a card whose suit is not weak against suitimon. If card is weak you lose five exp.

*Challenge a suitor and bet five to ten exp. Suitors chooses a captured suitimon for the other to battle. Highest attack value wins the exp. Loser discards their suitimon.
