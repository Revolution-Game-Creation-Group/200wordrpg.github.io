<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Hell, Elephants !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Eternal damnation isn't that bad, all things considered.

I mean, sure it's unbearably hot outside, but you were given a house with all the amenities you could want, and including air conditioning. What's more, your friends are all here too. In fact, your all having a dinner party tonight.

One or two players will host. It is their task to lead their guests on a tour of their home, serve them dinner, and provide entertainment.

Guests will describe their arrival at the party, engage courteously with the hosts, complimenting their home and food, and make small talk.

All will describe their actions in detail, with emphasis on the logistics of movement and the passing of dishes.

Ah, yes. One last detail: The elephant in the room, as it were. The elephants in every room, to be more literal. Every single room in the house is almost entirely occupied by an elephant, multiple if the room is large enough. Everyone must squeeze and maneuver themselves past the pachyderm to do anything; and, most importantly, never acknowledge them.

If anyone mentions the elephants, be it in or out of character, snap a rubber band against their forehead.

Welcome to hell.

# You Had a Time Machine

 
```
You were all there at the end, and you were so close to stopping everything going wrong. You'd worked so much out, found so many answers. And still you failed.

But you had a time machine.

You're there again. It's near the end now, but there's some time left. Maybe hours, maybe days? You're not future you, who travelled through time: they can't come here now. They went back, way back. Got jobs, produced art, created products: left you clues. You don't have their memories, but if you can find their hints, you just might be able to fix things this time.

When faced with a decision to make, everyone looks at the objects around them: books, DVDs, packets of food. Each person picks something. Reads the words on it, looks at the pictures, examines its form. Future you knew what you'd pick, so it must be right.

Find the meaning in it.

Someone tells the others what they've found and gives two courses of action that it suggests to them. Simultaneously vote on the actions. If it's split, take the more popular action. If it's unanimous, take that action but the outcome will be bad.

Fix it this time.

# EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE

 
```
You can't save everyone, you must try nonetheless. With great responsibility comes moderate power. Decide who you are, FBI, police, vigilantes, Neighbourhood Watch, kids in a van. Those who know can rarely act, those with power rarely believe, you must straddle the lines.

SETTING:
Beige computers. Smoking on planes. Colour TV. Pagers. Housewives. 

RULES:
If it just happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't
If you might not succeed, flip a coin. Heads you do
If something bad might happen AS WELL, flip. Heads it doesn't
Apply coins to any outcome
More risk, +1 coin, +1 bad thing
Prepared for exact situation, +1 coin

There are Exceptional people with powers unknown: if they turn to violence, you must stop them. You must save them.

EXCEPTIONS BREAK THE RULES:
They have talents, spells, knacks. You can't beat them with just coins. They have plenty power, little control, no training. They are desperate, scared, sad, hungry, angry, trapped. If they want it, you will die.

Roll twice, combine:
Fire		See
Water		Hear
Earth		Smell
Air		Touch
Metal		Taste
Wood		Music
Mind		Time
Body		Doom
Life		Creation
Death		Nothing

+10 points for "bringing in" Exception. -1 per death, including theirs, including yours.

# Auntie Comes to Tea
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Consent, pushing boundaries, analogies to partner/date rape !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Auntie Comes to Tea is a duet game about boundaries and consent. The two characters haven't seen each other for awhile. One character, Auntie, dearly wants to catch up over tea. The other character, Host, doesn't want to see this family member.

1.	Decide who will be Auntie and who will be the Host.
2.	Write down your character's name, pronouns, and other important details.
3.	Decide why you haven't seen each other in some time.
4.	Decide together or separately:
a.	Auntie, what do you miss about Host?
b.	Host, why do you want to avoid Auntie?

Auntie narrates beginning the conversation (phone, bumping into each other, etc.). Share pleasantries and small talk. Play truly begins when Auntie asks Host if they want to have afternoon tea sometime: 

Unless Host gives a clear 'Yes' or 'No', Auntie must keep making requests for afternoon tea. 

Host, you are worried about offending Auntie, so must reject Auntie's requests without saying 'Yes' or 'No' for as long as possible.

Play ends when Host gives a clear 'Yes' or 'No'. Narrate your characters parting ways. Debrief your feelings, the discomfort or difficulty of saying 'No', and how it relates to the real world.

	smile

until Nothing leaves
	& you're off to be Something again

# Theatrical Release

 
```
You are collaborating to make a movie. Decide what kind. However, each player has their own agenda for it. Roll 2d6 to determine what that is, re-rolling duplicates.

2- You already had this giant mechanical contraption made, so...
3- This product placement WILL happen
4- Promised role to bumbling cousin
5- Ensure staff are treated well
6- Stay within budget
7- Win a major award
8- Tell a compelling story
9- Showcase technical aspects
10- Cats are cute
11- Piss off your dad(s)
12- Characters can only speak at most 200 words
          
Each player has 3 dice. Choose a player to start with Creative Control. They describe the movie: the setting, themes, cast, plot and scenes. At any time, someone may interrupt and give a die to attempt to take Creative Control. They both roll. High roll gets Creative Control and continues describing the movie. Low roll introduces a minor complication.

Players without dice may get one from another by agreeing to a stipulation.

Player with Creative Control may ask anotherr for help to lock in an aspect of the movie. Both players lose a die each.

Once all dice are lost, the movie is released as is.

# Three wishes

 
```
Player 1 "Eretic" : you are a condemned waiting for execution. 

Pick a historical or fictional background and describe yourself and the scene. 

Player 2 "Demon": you are a demon of sorts. 

Appear to Player 1 and offer to grant 3 wishes. You are going to have fun with that. 

Roleplay the scene.

Player 1: write 3 wishes, using 6 or less words for each wish.

3 WISHES RULE (is known to Player 1 before they write):

1 wish will be granted and narrated by the Demon starting with: YES, AND... 

1 wish will be granted and narrated by the Demon starting with: YES, BUT...

1 wish will be granted and narrated by the Demon starting with: WELL, ALMOST, BUT NOT REALLY, BECAUSE...

Then Player 1: narrate a conclusion and call the demon to grant a Last Wish. 

Write the Last Wish down using 9 or less words. 

LAST WISH RULE (is known to Player 1 before they write):

The demon will turn 1 word of the Last Wish in that word's opposite. 

Then she (grinningly) grants it. 

Roleplay the end.

(Does that word have an opposite? Is that the real opposite? If there's a discussion, it's part of the game.)

# Plasty

 
```
This is a GM-less RPG about the diverse relationships people have with their bodies.
Before the game begins, answer these questions privately about your character:
Why are you here? Medical reasons? Cosmetic? In between?
How do you feel in your body?
How do you feel about your body?
Do you feel healthy? Beautiful?
What do you most hope for from surgery?
Play begins as characters gather in plastic surgeon's office.
Each player describes their character and what they choose to read while they wait to see the doctor.
When the silence becomes overwhelming, break it.
Use the flow of conversation to answer questions about yourself and others.
Play ends when a player says "oh, that's me." signalling that they have been called out of the waiting room.
