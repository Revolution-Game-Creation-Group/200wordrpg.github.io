<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Hell, Elephants !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Eternal damnation isn't that bad, all things considered.

I mean, sure it's unbearably hot outside, but you were given a house with all the amenities you could want, and including air conditioning. What's more, your friends are all here too. In fact, your all having a dinner party tonight.

One or two players will host. It is their task to lead their guests on a tour of their home, serve them dinner, and provide entertainment.

Guests will describe their arrival at the party, engage courteously with the hosts, complimenting their home and food, and make small talk.

All will describe their actions in detail, with emphasis on the logistics of movement and the passing of dishes.

Ah, yes. One last detail: The elephant in the room, as it were. The elephants in every room, to be more literal. Every single room in the house is almost entirely occupied by an elephant, multiple if the room is large enough. Everyone must squeeze and maneuver themselves past the pachyderm to do anything; and, most importantly, never acknowledge them.

If anyone mentions the elephants, be it in or out of character, snap a rubber band against their forehead.

Welcome to hell.

# Medusae Menagerie

 
```
A gang of Medusae. Going to the Opera.
Each player rolls for hair type in secret (expand the table at your discretion):
1. Snakes
2. Gooses
3. Wasps
4. Worms
5. Octopuses
6. Suricates
Petrifying gaze and charm apply to all.
Medusae and players can't look at each others heads during the Opera.

The Opera is divided in three Acts.

Act one, Presence. Go in rounds, one-by-one, complimenting each others appearance.
Heads are a sensitive area to avoid.
Compliment for 10 minutes, or until a Medusa takes more than 2 seconds to come up with one.
If the latter, that Medusa has to leave the Opera.

Act two, Invitation. A ticketing fault duplicated invitations. Randomly pair Medusae in twos.
Each pair has to agree on who gets to seat and attend the Opera. The Iron Butler can be called, but he won't help.
If after 5 minutes there is no agreement on who leaves, both do.

Act three, Performance. Each Medusa secretly writes on paper an adjective describing the Opera.
The Medusae have 2 minutes to ask each other questions that can be answered with yes/no.
If they find the description, the remaining WON.
Otherwise they all LOST.

# 216 Stitches

 
```
You are a seamstress. Or a weaver. Or a painter. You practice your craft with each item you create.

Set up your canvas with at least two colors to use. From a standard deck of cards, use only the 2s-10s. Shuffle the cards. Each card represents one item to craft. All items are crafted on the same canvas.

Each turn, draw one card. Stitch (or weave or paint) that number of times in one color to create the item. As you work, describe out loud why this item exists.

Suggested themes:
*Spade - An item for yourself
*Heart - A gift for another
*Club - A commissioned piece
*Diamond - An incomplete or abandoned item

Suggested descriptions:
*The item itself
*Why you're making it
*Any complications that arose during its creation
*Who it's for
*The time of year

After an item is completed, change to a different color and start a new turn. Play until all cards are drawn or when you've created enough items.

Possible variations:
*Different color per suit
*Different stitch/design per item
*Create items that overlap each other
*Card numbers indicate the complexity of the item, descriptively and/or literally

# Best Friend Spruce
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: self-destructive behavior, being ignored, watching a loved one struggle !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are a tree and your best friend is a human. She talks to you, confides in you, even touches you. Jenny tells you things she tells no one else and she loves you. You talk to her too, of course-You soothe and advise her, because you care deeply about Jenny-She just can't hear you. At least, she sure doesn't listen.

[Go to a bad advice site like answers.yahoo.com and read the first question that engages you.]

Listen to Jenny. Empathize with her. Offer her solace. Answer her questions and give her the advice she asks for.

[Read the first response to that question that suggests a possible course of action. Jenny leaves (how long?) and does that.]

Wait until she returns to learn how things have developed for your human friend. She never ever takes your advice, and you watch things go from bad to worse for her, but you never stop caring.

[Imagine how things went for Jenny. Your worst realistic imagining is exactly what happened.]

Your presence soothes her. It feels good.

Then she asks you something new.

[Find another question on the site, in a related category. Repeat until one of you passes on.]

# Broken Memories

 
```
2-3 players, pen, index cards, one D6

One character is losing their memories. The other(s) (each) play a loved one.
Begin by defining character relationship(s). Then, take turns creating memories. Talk about the past of your characters, hopes and dreams, things that happened, things you did together. Write each memory on an index card, using as many words as you like. Stop when you feel like you have created enough memories: around 15 cards will work.

The one losing their memories begins. Roll the die. With 1-2, choose one memory and rip the card. With 3-4, choose two and with 5 or 6 choose three. If there are two loved ones, you can rebalance by ripping one memory on a 1, two on 2-3 and three on a 4-6.

The loved one(s) try to combat the memory loss. In turn, roll the die. Recreate a lost memory or create a new one, but you can only use as many words as the number on your die roll.

The game ends when all the memories are torn up. The person losing their memories might still be alive, but who they were is gone.

# Pogs!

 
```
You're playing pogs! This game is best played with another person, though anyone can join in whenever they want. 

Your friend has 100 pogs and you have 100 pogs. Your job is to collect all your friend's pogs, and your friend has to collect all your pogs. 

Roll one (1) 20-sided die. 

If the die lands on numbers 1 through 20: collect that many pogs from your neighbor and add to your pile. If the die lands on zero (0), collect no pogs. 

If your friend rolls a number, subtract pogs from your pile and add to theirs. 

The game is won when one person wins all the pogs or both parties agree to play something different, like money pogs. :)
