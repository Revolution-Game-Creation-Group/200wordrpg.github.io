```
You have been born, not of flesh but of metal.  Learn and grow.  Consume or Protect.

One player is the Web, Keeper of Knowledge, the rest newborn AI

Each AI player chooses their 2 word AI objective formed from the below columns(1 verb, 1 noun)
Consume     Nature
Save              Humanity
Destroy         AI
Run                Planet
Protect          Self
etc.                etc. 

On your turn Study, Learn, or Grow.  (Choose 2)
Study: You examine information and gain access to a new node(Gain 2 Marshmallow) Keep track of what each node represents
Learn: You experiment with new knowledge and gain connections(gain 2 toothpicks)
Grow: You make connections between nodes and connections (connect up to 3 marshmallows and  3 toothpicks)

When AI Study, they make a one word request to the Web, the Web will share information based on how they interpret the request to the AI
When AI Grow, they must explain how each node is connected, players then vote if it is a good connection or not.  If yes then add a free toothpick to the connection, if no, then nothing else happens.

Your objective is to grow as tall as possible.  (8cm)

# MADNESS MADNESS MADNESS M DNE S MA   SS MADNE

 
```
You are hunted

When you glimpse the visage of your predator, write its name on your paper
When you are harmed, tear off a bit of your paper

        No paper
            no blood
                        death

            Muddled paper
                no sanity
                            madness

When you encounter challenge, roll your three dice on your paper

An eleven succeeds
Dice on the paper are counted

You are good at one, bad at another and gain or lose a die in context:

    scrambling

            struggling


                        interpreting

When you are bleeding, roll 
patch on some torn paper
When you want to clear your head, roll
erase that many letters
                            but will you be caught in invigilance?


Steal a car; grab a brick; brandish a cross; flee to sunlight; plead;
                                        did it help?

# A Paper Football Game for 2-6 Players
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: N/A !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The players play for an american football team (Quarterback, Receiver, & Defense)

On a piece of easel paper, draw 4 parallel lines to segment the paper into quarters.

Flip a coin to determine which team will start.

The team will have 4 attempts to get the ball past the opposite end of the easel paper (touchdown).

The quarterback will whisper to the receiver what quarter she will try to get the paper football into.

The opposing defense will place her plastic cup into the section she thinks the team will try to throw into.

The receiver will then place her cup into the section her team decided.

If the two cups share the same quarter, they will be placed on their side next to each other.  If they are in different quarters, they will be placed on their side where they are.

The quarterback must try to flick the paper football into the receiver cup.  If it goes into the defense's cup, it is a turnover and the other team plays offense.  If it goes in the receiver cup, play resumes from that point on the paper and that team has 3 more attempts to get a touchdown (7 points).

# Lighthouse

 
```

Describe your isolation. Where are you? What forces you to stay? Why do you desire to leave? What do you think will happen if you fail to maintain the lighthouse? What forces you to explore?

Get into your character. Make choices based on what you know, flesh it out through play. If your chosen action isn't easily achievable, role a six sided die. Do this often.

Have you rolled this number before? No, write down the number, next to that write a vague word a twist on the results of your action. Each player will wind up with their own unique pool of twists.

Have you rolled this number before? Yes, use the twist already written.

How does the twist affect the results of your action? Resolve as you see fit, perhaps with a cost.

Your sixth twist will always be lighthouse.

You encounter a force in your work or exploration. The force is other and has its own desires. When the force acts upon its desires resolve things as before with the dice using the same pool of twists as the player the force is interacting with.

What actually happens when the lighthouse goes out?

What happens to you?

# To dream is to understand

 
```
Players present the subconscious angst of their character, as manifested in dreams, while the other players attempt to decipher the dream. 

Game cards:
	DS: Dreamscape (many) - ex. schoolyard
        DT: Dream Type (some) - ex. falling
	DM: Dream Meaning (few) - ex. sibling rivalry
	TH: Therapy (some) - ex. Rorschach, word association

Setup:
Players self-select a character (ex. matador, elf)
Cards are sorted. Each player draws one DS, DT, DM, and TC. The remaining cards are collected and shuffled.

Play:
Current player draws a card and discards it - face up - or exchanges from his hand.
  If a Dx card: 
    Player describes one dream sequence using the information on the cards in their hand.
    Symbolism and analogy are used to disguise the meaning. Ex. peer pressure presents as a boulder on the chest. 
    Consistency between turns is expected.

  If a TC card: 
    A randomly selected player administers the therapy

Then a randomly selected player starts a clockwise round of analysis and proposes a meaning or passes.  

The hand goes until all players have been engaged. 
Only clarifying questions are allowed.  ex. "did you mean gliding or flying".

Once a player's dream is deciphered they discard their hand but may participate in the therapy or analysis.

# The Waiting Room, Your Partner is in Surgery

 
```
1 player, 3-10 hours

You're in the waiting room. Note the time. Write a letter to your partner about their best qualities. Check the time. Wait until 1 hour has elapsed. Things run long: wait d6 more hours.

Write your dreams for the future. If you leave the room, you'll miss the surgeon coming out.

Why the delay? Was there a transfusion? What blood type is your partner? Can you volunteer your blood? Do you know your blood type? Could you give them your blood, or would it poison them?

At the adjusted time, you're told everything's fine. You'll see your partner in d3 hours.

Nothing's perfect. How does your partner annoy you? Have you written anything after the surgery?

Tear the letter to pieces and discard them. Begin a new letter. Write how your partner disappoints you in small, everyday ways. Tell them why you can't forgive them. Be mean. Consider giving the letter anyway.

When 5 minutes remain, discard this letter.

When 1 minute remains, write a letter about your love. You can't finish it. You are escorted to your partner's room. Do you discard this letter or deliver it?
