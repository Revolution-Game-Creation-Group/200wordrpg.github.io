etc.                etc. 

On your turn Study, Learn, or Grow.  (Choose 2)

Grow: You make connections between nodes and connections (connect up to 3 marshmallows and  3 toothpicks)

When AI Study, they make a one word request to the Web, the Web will share information based on how they interpret the request to the AI

# Speak with Dead

 
```
To begin, players introduce their mediums and gives an interesting story about the location.  They must each briefly shuffle or handle the deck.

Taking turns each medium closes their eyes, and asks a question of the spirits.  The Spirits (other players) draw a single card, discarding it face down.  Without discussion, they describe or enact the response.  One spirit may narrate the whole response or each may contribute a part.  Messages from the spirits are often confusing.  The current medium may not ask for clarification but may offer their own interpretation.  Any player may touch the deck to end the response and the turn.

When drawing a five or less (including aces), the spirits remain silent, discard the card and wait for the medium to pass their turn.  Otherwise the attitude of the response is decided by the suit of the drawn card. Face cards add an identifiable apparition of some kind.  Responses may include, noises, whispers, memories, apparitions and even movement of furniture.

Six and up:
Heart: Emotion, Memory
Diamond: Definite Affirmative
Club: Violence, Movement
Spade: Definite Denial
Jack: Child
Queen: Woman
King: Man

The night ends when the mediums are certain of the truth or have fled.

# FINAL GIRLS
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: violence, murder, use of fire, mention of scars !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are the Final Girls, last bastion of your fractured group left standing against a relentless killer. The killer will not rest until they, or all of you, are dead. But they don't win this time.

YOU NEED:
candle
dark room
six-sided die
red lipstick
2+ players

Light candle. Turn off lights. Take turns rolling the die and answering questions. Every time you answer, mark somewhere on your body with the lipstick.

1. What distinguishing characteristic of the killer's did you see? Where have you seen it before?
2. How did you narrowly escape this time? Why won't it work again?
3. What makes you stronger than people think?
4. What did you lose before you had nothing left to lose?
5. What about you is too messy, too broken, too much for most people? How has it saved you here?
6. How did you die?

When only 1 Final Girl remains alive, she blows out the candle and describes how she defeats the killer once and for all. Turn on the lights and celebrate your scars together.

# One Must Ascend

 
```
You are a God - describe your aspects (Fire, Love, etc.) - Start the game with a pool of ten power tokens.

Take one action per turn:

War: Pick someone; your followers fight theirs. Both describe how and where.

Divine Council*

The winner rolls 2d6, the loser 1d6 - whoever rolls highest takes the difference, in tokens, from the other.

Worship: add one token to your pool.

Quest: Describe your hero and their quest and add up to three tokens to it. Any other god may describe a challenge for them to face. The questing god then describes how the hero tackles it.

Divine Council*

Hero wins - add one token from the challenger's pool to the quest.
Challenger wins - Take one token from the quest and add it to their pool.

Repeat until no more challenges are offered.
The questing god then doubles the tokens, adding them to their pool.

Ascend - Commit any number of tokens. Any god may commit tokens to cancel yours out. If any remain at the end, you win. All tokens committed are removed from play.


*All gods not involved must decide who wins, by majority. No draws allowed. The council can demand more description to decide.

# Super Lost

 
```
Paranormal investigators go into a haunted location (forest, manor etc.) that shifts and changes making it difficult to leave. The only way forward is to find and confront the Evil that controls the location.

Players 

Describe backstory, careers, expertise. 

Roll 2d6 to perform tasks. A 9 or higher is a success. You may get bonuses to rolls based on expertise or circumstance.

Gamemaster

Each time the players move on from a region one player rolls 2d6. If it is a 12, they have found a significant location. Once 3 significant locations are found, they will travel to the Evil on the next turn.

Flavor significant locations and the Evil however you see fit. 

Defeating The Evil

Get creative with the Evil. Encourage players to come up with clever ways to deal with it and give bonuses accordingly.

First, players get a chance at the evil. The evil is defeated when all players roll successes in a turn. Adjust as needed.

If they fail, the Evil gets to go. 

Each player rolls an evasion for the evil. If they fail, they take a permanent -1 penalty to rolls. If they roll a 2 they are killed outright.

Fast mode:
Rejected Passenger goes home. Winners - Passengers on board, Officer with max promotion points.

Light mode:
Rejected Passenger goes to the end of the queue and talk to Officer more warely next time. Game ends when all Passengers are on board. Win Officer with max promotion points.

Hard mode:

# Pigeon? Impossible!

 
```
You are an elite infiltration/exfiltration team composed of pigeons. 

Choose a name, a skill (e.g. explosives, hacking, wing-to-wing combat), a weakness.

Give each pigeon 3 cards. Write on each a pigeon-y action (e.g. bristling feathers, unexpected defecation). 

PM Questions

- What is your target? 
- What protects it? 
- What are you after? 

Use their answers to challenge the team.

Pigeons are small and the world is large; success requires fast, silent, coordination.

When an obstacle is encountered every pigeon will suggest a plan. The PM will secretly rank the plans (1 is best).

Each pigeon will indicate their preferred plan using a card. No other communication is allowed. Then they will secretly and simultaneously commit to a plan.

For each mission roll 1d6: 

For every pigeon on the mission;
For every pigeon that uses their skill;
If plan creator chose it;
If the plan was described using only cards. 

Subtract 1d6 for every pigeon that exposes their weakness.
 
A success is a 4+. A mission succeeds if the number of successes exceeds the plan's rank. 

If a mission succeeds the team progresses. Failures cause complications and every failure increases the next missions' success requirement by one.
