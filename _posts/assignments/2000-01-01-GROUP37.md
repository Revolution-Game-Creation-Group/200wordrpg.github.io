# The Defeated

 
```
They wanted to reshape the world. You stood against them as heroes to preserve your people. You failed. They won. Where do you go from here?

Describe who you were before the End.
Explain how you failed at the critical moment.
Contemplate what you seek in the ashes.

Take a deck of playing cards. Deal each person a hand of (2 x number of players). Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the table.

To begin, a player reveals the top card of the deck.

Hearts = A scene of emotional connection
Diamonds = A scene of future possibility
Clubs = A scene of confrontation
Spades = A flashback to the conflict

Along with the other players, enact your scene. At the climactic moment, all players play a single card from their hand. Black = failure. Red = success. Current player break ties. Describe the ending accordingly and note the result. Play passes clockwise.

Once players have no cards left, the game is over. Count your scene results; if more successes, you have found a new purpose. If more failures, you have been broken by the past. If equal, you remain in torment. One by one, narrate your epilogue.

# We. Are. GNOMES!!!

 
```
Your endless ingenuity and creative prowess threaten the Emperor. Rounded up and imprisoned, your people work away your days in forced labour. In 4 days, you escape together.

Build the prison, roll 2d6, each result eliminates a feature: 1-Magical Locks, 2-Underwater, 3-Underground, 4-Beasts, 5-Unblinking Guards, 6-Turrets.

Each day, Build or Aid towards a component for The Contraption. Each component foils a prison feature. To Build, Roll 2d6. DC 5+ succeeds. If successful, roll an additional d6 to conceal your work. If die share a value with either of the Build die cast, you conceal the ruse, and the component is built. If doubles are rolled you are discovered: increase Build DC +1, you may only Build until the escape. To Aid another, you may reroll any one die cast by a player who builds. Only one player may Aid per Build.
Each day sees the total for a success increase by 1. If a component seems outlandish (and it should), Increase Build DC +1, roll 2d6 to conceal. Dumb guards won't see it coming.

On the 5th day, you make your escape, describe how The Contraption undermines the prison features.

# Vampire, 2020
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Vampires, Blood, Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```

You're a vampire. 
Pick a name. From anywhere.
Pick an age. From yesterday to 1000 years.
Pick a fashion. Antiquated, Simple, Trendy, Unkempt.

Roll d10 for:

Diplomacy		Subterfuge		Violence		Magic

Roll d10 at or under attribute to succeed.

Façade starts at 10. Following subtract from Facade:

Burner Phone 
Driver's license
Internet 
Paid work
Smartphone

Legit subtracts 2. Shady subtracts 1. 
A smartphone subtracts double.
If seen, roll d10 at or under Façade to remain in shadows. Otherwise, add 1 Mark.

At 1 Mark, the hunters know your alias.
At 2 Marks, they know your feeding grounds.
At 3 Marks, they know your address. Run, now.

GM roll d10 for scenarios:
1: A gnawing hunger arises.
2: A large event arrives. More blood, more security.
3: An old debt is called in.
4: Hunters found your friend.

7: You find a hunter's address.
8: You're caught in a crossfire.

# Object Delusion Support Group

 
```
Each player selects an everyday item - a pen, a coin, a shoe - that they have to hand.

Players take turns revealing their item to the group. For each item, the other players act as if they have never seen such an item before and, with great bemusement, question its use and origin.

The owner of the item maintains that it is a common object in everyday use, as the rest improvise and corroborate a parallel universe where it would be nonsensical or impractical for such items to exist.

For example, if the item were a banknote, the parallel universe could be one where there is no such thing as cash, or there is no such thing as paper, or the entire concept of money does not exist. Meanwhile, the owner of the banknote is absolutely certain that it is a normal everyday object, and cannot understand why the others do not recognise it.

Turns end when creativity begins to wane. The game continues until all players have had a chance to present their item. The group must do its best to maintain the coherence of the parallel universe as it becomes increasingly outlandish with every additional object excluded.

# In the olden times..

 
```
Players guide a shepherd as they herd their flock through the overgrown ruins of a once great city, the former heart of a long fallen empire.

One at a time the players pick a location the herd is grazing through and the shepherd contemplates. 

The current player begins the contemplation by saying "In the olden times they used to.." and the player shares a long passed rumor, memory or tale of the old empire and their customs. Did they sell fellow men for a few scraps of gold? Did they send inexhaustible armies beyond the horizon? Do the ruins provoke awe, bemusement, fear?

The current player ends their tale by saying ".. but not anymore." The herd moves on and the next player picks a location to ruminate over. Once every player has shared two tales, the day draws to an end and the flock leaves the city.

For locations select attractions from a tourist map of any major city.

# Together We Go - An Improv Roleplaying Game

 
```
A group of 5-10 people sit in a circle/ around a table. Drawn from a bowl, each player blindly chooses from Roles with a certain Gift;

A King - With Wisdom: a Voice Like a Drum
A Saint - With Faith : Hands that Heal
A Soldier - With Courage : a Rifle for Protection
A Scholar - With Reason: a Book Full of Words
A Shepherd - With Vigilance: a Flock to Guard
A Wizard - With Wit: a Staff of Illusion
A Peasant - With Sympathy: a Tankard of Ale
A Child - With Joy: the Toys of Youth
A Nobel - With Grace: the Coin of their Rank
Death - With Finality: the Scyth of Division

The story, told collectively and improvisationally through the different roles, focuses on a journey to:

Defeat a Great Evil
Find True Love
Break a Terrible Curse

Together players decide the type and, starting with the peasant, proceed clockwise. A player's role isn't revealed until the end of their turn. Items are used as plot elements and to transition between players. The goal is to keep the story going until Death's turn. When Death is reached they summarize and finalize the story, then collect the rolls back into the bowl to be redistributed.
