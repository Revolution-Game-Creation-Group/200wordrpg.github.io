# The Defeated

 
```
They wanted to reshape the world. You stood against them as heroes to preserve your people. You failed. They won. Where do you go from here?

Describe who you were before the End.
Explain how you failed at the critical moment.
Contemplate what you seek in the ashes.

Take a deck of playing cards. Deal each person a hand of (2 x number of players). Place the rest of the deck in the middle of the table.

To begin, a player reveals the top card of the deck.

Hearts = A scene of emotional connection
Diamonds = A scene of future possibility
Clubs = A scene of confrontation
Spades = A flashback to the conflict

Along with the other players, enact your scene. At the climactic moment, all players play a single card from their hand. Black = failure. Red = success. Current player break ties. Describe the ending accordingly and note the result. Play passes clockwise.

Once players have no cards left, the game is over. Count your scene results; if more successes, you have found a new purpose. If more failures, you have been broken by the past. If equal, you remain in torment. One by one, narrate your epilogue.

# Top Hats

 
```
These aliens look like hats and control the humans wearing them. They want to take over. The players are under their control.

You'll need some variety of hats (one per player), index cards, pins, pens.
Give each player 4 cards. On two, they write personality traits (like impulsive, cautious, joyous, grumpy, awkward). On the other two, write skills (like acrobatics, pediatrics, romance novelist, rocket science).

Shuffle personality traits and pin two to each hat. Shuffle skills and pin two to each player. Each player puts on a random hat. The hats invaded and took over a group of humans.

Players exhibit their hat's personality traits. Some hats have accents or mannerisms. These traits follow the hats (the hats are the characters). A player (and the hat controlling them) always has access to their skills.

Negotiate the best combination of personalities and skills for global domination. Argue. Plot. Plan. Trade hats. Try various combinations.

Human subjects experience confusion for a few seconds after a hat is removed. Negotiations end immediately if one of the subjects escapes or all hats agree to their current assignment.

How does each hat contribute to the invasion? How successful was the invasion as a whole?

# Wholesome Bug Date
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Bugs, Violence, Violence on a Date !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are two nervous bugs on a date! 

Before!
Plan a nice day inside together - cooking a meal, reading on the couch, watching a movie, etc.
Get one pool noodle, boffer weapon, or something that doesn't hurt much to get devastated by. Decide which bug gets the weapon. For politeness, male bugs offer up the weapon first. Agree where it's okay to strike the Unarmed Bug.
Bugs introduce one another by stating something they find pleasant or alluring about the other bug. Use bug words like carapace, mandibles, or make up new bug terms.

Play!
Start your date by physically doing the activity planned! Talk about your bug day, your bug lives, or your ideal bug relationship.
Keep the weapon within reach of the Armed Bug. Remind the Unarmed Bug it's nearby. The Unarmed Bug may never touch the weapon.
During the date, the Armed Bug may pick up the weapon and strike the Unarmed Bug. If struck, they are now dead and may no longer participate in the date's activities. The Armed Bug may continue the date alone until they wish to end the date.
The Unarmed Bug may flee the date at any time, ending the date.

# Sailor's Sewing Day

 
```
You are a sailor at sea. Today you are mending your clothes.

Each player needs a sheet of paper towel, needle, and thread. 

For each sheet:  
Tear a line from edge to center.
Rip out a hole.
Rip off a corner.

Put all scraps together in the middle of the group. Decide the nature of your ship and why it is at sea.

Each player threads their needles. As you do, talk about who you are and how you came to be on the ship.  

A player begins sewing one rip/tear on their sheet. Randomly take a scrap from the center to mend missing pieces. 

Based on what you are mending, talk about:
Tear - An unfinished business or regret.
Hole - A special person and why they are special.
Corner - How you almost died in the ship, and how you were saved. 

Players take turns sharing stories based on the prompts until everyone has taken a turn. The round moves when all rips/tears selected in the previous round are mended. Fill time by conversing on what has been shared. 

When all rips are mended, talk about how each sailor has grown at sea and how their clothes reflect this.

# Fish Tale
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Reference to alcohol. Questionable puns. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You and your fishin' buddies had a helluva day on the water. Time to brag about your catch!

Choose a BARTENDER (GM). Players are ANGLERS.

ANGLERS start with two coins and a d6.

The BARTENDER will need three coins each in three piles labeled HUMAN, FISH and STUFF.



GEAR

ANGLERS have fancy GEAR. Pick from the below GEAR, two per ANGLER. No repeating GEAR.

Spring-loaded Rod
Captain's Hat
Lifelike Lure
Master Bait
High-tech Reel
Tough Net
Brewski Belt
Braided Line
Tide Chart
Weather Report
Guidebook
Fish Finder
First Aid Kit
10-in-1 Multi-tool
Folded Steel Knife



BARTENDERS - if part of the story seems fishy, interrupt and call for a HUMAN, FISH or STUFF roll. The ANGLER rolls their d6.

Roll equal or lower than the number of coins in the called pile to succeed. 

Remove a coin from the pile on failure. When there is one coin in each pile, the ANGLERS are caught in their lie! 

If an ANGLER uses their GEAR in their action, roll 2d6. 



BUYING BEERS

ANGLERS can add their coins to the BARTENDER'S piles to make rolls easier. 

If the ANGLER'S story impresses the BARTENDER, give that ANGLER a coin that has been removed.

Choose a recipe, any recipe.

For each step of the recipe roll a D20 for the corresponding skill. Roll above or exact to pass. This is for every step from prepping the ingredients to plating. 

If you fail the roll you must mess up that step. It doesn't matter how you mess it up, but you have to mess it up. The head chef gets final say as to how to mess it up. 

If you roll a 20 you perfected that step, and no one can say otherwise.
If you roll a 1 you completely fail that step, more so than you would have you only failed the roll. Please no bodily harm or setting very large fires.

Enjoy the food you made.
