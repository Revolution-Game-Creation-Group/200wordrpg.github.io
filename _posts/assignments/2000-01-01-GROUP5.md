# A Sticky Situation
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: None !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You thought it was over; the proverbial bar fight adventure hook done and dusted or successfully avoided, and you were on you way to new adventures. Except, as you exit the bar, there they are, waiting for you. Perhaps they slipped around the back when you weren't watching, or they are reinforcements summoned by magic (or by the noise). Whatever the reason, they now bar your way.

This narrative driven RPG uses the game Pick Up Sticks as its mechanic. As each PC's action is declared, the GM decides how difficult that action is to achieve, from easy to nigh-on impossible, and assigns to it a coloured stick: yellow, blue, red, green, or black. The player must successfully draw a stick of that colour from the stick-pile without moving any other stick for the task to succeed. Players also draw a stick for actions made against them and/or their corresponding reaction (such as dodging a punch - a failed stick-pull would mean the punch lands or the dodge fails). The game ends when the fight is diffused or one party is unconscious (or worse) and (finally) the next adventure can begin.

# ARKANA
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: non-occult usage of tarot cards !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Players are sprites tasked to shape a young world.
Players and DM take tarot sets and split them into major and minor arcana and shuffle.

Stats:
distribute: 1,2,3,3
*create&shape-wands
*destroy&reduce-swords
* communicate&influence-coins
*life&resistance-cups

checks 
Choose apropriate skill and draw cards accordingly from lower arkana and add values together,
if card-suit matches skill, value doubles 
if sum matches value on major arkana card from DM=success
if exactly 2 show the same suit=crit
if other player supports, add half  of other player's card suit-value rounded down.
If DM performs check, either use card suit-value or draw a storyline-appropriate amount of cards.
If player loses, a different approach must be used.


GM uses major arkana-cards to tell the story, one at a time. If a player resolves a card(=situation) with a critical skill check, GM awards said card to player.
GM can add additional cards to introduce adversaries and complications.

Players can use card amount equal to skill rating to raise skill, or can use card to SWAY story, by using card as inspiration to change course of story, but player can only add to GM's story.

Keep going until deck is empty or the story is told.

# The Love-Stained Wisdom King
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Lust !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Play as you read.

Imagine someone most perfectly worthy of your lust. Burn in your desire for them. Feel this pain, which is real.

Imagine that all motion ceases in the universe. Imagine that Ragaraja appears before you, in this eternal moment, with his six treasures in his six hands. He will present each and shock you into contemplation, transforming lust into insight.

First is his Bell. Your heart is focused by its sound.
    In what colors do your flames burn?
    By what names are your emotions called?

Second is his Thunderbolt. Your heart is electrified by its power.
    With what sounds do your flames burn?
    By what forms are your emotions shaped?

Third is his Lotus. Your heart is lulled by its serenity.
    In what motion do your flames burn?
    By what dreams are your emotions ignited?

Fourth is his Bow. Your heart is agitated by its majesty.
    Within what limits do your flames burn?
    By what courses will your emotions tamed?

Fifth is his Arrow. Your heart is joyed by its forthrightness.
    From what fuels do your flames burn?
    By what actions will your emotions unleashed?

Last is something you cannot see.

Ragaraja departs.

The game is over.

As a group determine: 
- Deity's and Cult's Name
- Deity's Symbols and Signs

Your Deity's Temperament (DT) starts at 8. If it becomes <1 you immediately lose or >21 the apocalypse ends early.

On your turn describe how you carry out a move, roll for DT, then explain the outcome as a mini-sermon.


## Moves

+3d6/2 members

Evangelize or Complete a Ritual
+d6 members; double a positive DT roll

Undercut Rivals
d6+1 members move to your cult


## Rolling DT

# A Mutiny Most Foul

 
```
The Captain is dead, and one of you will be forever branded.

Write the following numbers and motives on index cards, and deal one to each player: 1-love, 2-duty, 3-cowardice, 4-greed, 5-cruelty, 6-hunger. These may be attributed to either your character or the captain; either way, it has created an intolerable situation. Repeat with the following: 1-hate, 2-treachery, 3-bravery, 4-fear, 5-justice, 6-compassion. These represent a trait of your character. Together, these reveal who your character is, and why they were willing to mutiny. If both numbers are the same, however, you must secretly remain loyal to your captain!

Players now take turns describing the situation that led to the mutiny. Reveal a card to determine who narrates first; a player with a 1 on either card goes first, followed by any 2, etc. No player may narrate a second scene until everyone has taken a turn. Once each player has taken a turn describing the situation, repeat with your other card to describe how the mutiny occurred.

If there is conflict, the numbers will determine the number of sailors who will fight with you. The higher total wins.

# Party's Past

 
```
Party's Past is an introductory campaign mini-game. The game has 3 phases of play - CHARACTER, QUESTIONS, ANSWERS.

CHARACTER
Each player creates their character by picking five words that describe their character. 

Alternatively, players may create their character using an RPG of their choice.

These characters make up the Party.

QUESTIONS
Next, players will create questions for the party. First, roll a d8 to determine the Audience that will be asking the characters questions.

Audience Table
1 - Kids playing in the street
2 - Wizard undergraduates
3 - Soldiers in training
4 - A beginning adventuring party
5 - Snide adolescents
6 - Clerics just sworn to an order
7 - Old-timers at a bar
8 - Player's choice

From the perspective of the Audience, each player writes up to 3 questions on notecards. Shuffle the questions into a pile face down.

ANSWERS
Now, each player will be roleplaying from their character's perspective.

A random character reveals the first question. In turn, characters may do one of the following:

-Answer a revealed question on a new notecard
-Add detail to a previously answered question
-Reveal a new question to answer

When all questions have been answered, a unique, shared past will have been created for the Party!

# Our bed is but a mossy stone

 
```
we are gentle souls
we are hungry to help
we are only a single inch tall

for now



our wanderpod, numbering under six, seeks chances to sow joy*
when one of us acts, the others eagerly observe
but the oracle never acts
they are even more different than we are
they only reveal perceived truths about our surroundings


if the oracle foresees potential misfortune, we toss a mathstone
its twenty faces will reveal our future
the oracle determines which two demonstrated traits sway the mathstone
one sways upward
one sways downward


if above ten, the actor's intentions bear sweet fruit
if below eleven, trouble sprouts like tangled weeds
trouble respects our immortality
the oracle relays the actor's fate, whispered from beyond


if one makes a human happy*, they grow to double their size
our shape, though stretching, remains consistent
yet with every growth, our traits transform
all seed traits fall one step
all thorn traits rise one step


before our story began, we each chose how to distribute steps, crafting our uniqueness
twenty steps raised seed traits (nimbleness, awareness, caution, kindness) above zero
twenty steps lowered thorn traits (strength, reach, boldness, hunger) below zero


*after seven growths, consuming replaces delighting
