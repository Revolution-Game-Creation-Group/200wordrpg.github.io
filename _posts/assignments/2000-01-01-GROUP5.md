# A Sticky Situation
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: None !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You thought it was over; the proverbial bar fight adventure hook done and dusted or successfully avoided, and you were on you way to new adventures. Except, as you exit the bar, there they are, waiting for you. Perhaps they slipped around the back when you weren't watching, or they are reinforcements summoned by magic (or by the noise). Whatever the reason, they now bar your way.

This narrative driven RPG uses the game Pick Up Sticks as its mechanic. As each PC's action is declared, the GM decides how difficult that action is to achieve, from easy to nigh-on impossible, and assigns to it a coloured stick: yellow, blue, red, green, or black. The player must successfully draw a stick of that colour from the stick-pile without moving any other stick for the task to succeed. Players also draw a stick for actions made against them and/or their corresponding reaction (such as dodging a punch - a failed stick-pull would mean the punch lands or the dodge fails). The game ends when the fight is diffused or one party is unconscious (or worse) and (finally) the next adventure can begin.

# You Had a Time Machine

 
```
You were all there at the end, and you were so close to stopping everything going wrong. You'd worked so much out, found so many answers. And still you failed.

But you had a time machine.

You're there again. It's near the end now, but there's some time left. Maybe hours, maybe days? You're not future you, who travelled through time: they can't come here now. They went back, way back. Got jobs, produced art, created products: left you clues. You don't have their memories, but if you can find their hints, you just might be able to fix things this time.

When faced with a decision to make, everyone looks at the objects around them: books, DVDs, packets of food. Each person picks something. Reads the words on it, looks at the pictures, examines its form. Future you knew what you'd pick, so it must be right.

Find the meaning in it.

Someone tells the others what they've found and gives two courses of action that it suggests to them. Simultaneously vote on the actions. If it's split, take the more popular action. If it's unanimous, take that action but the outcome will be bad.

Fix it this time.

# Waiting for Godot, the Role-Playing Game

 
```
One player says: "Nothing to be done." This begins the scene. All players may then respond with whatever lines they would like from the following list, whenever they would like. They may not say anything not on the list. 

Ah!
Off we go.
Am I?
Over there.
And so on.
Possibly.
And what of it?
Shall we go?
Ask him.
Silence!
Carry on.
So he says.
Farewell.
There's nothing to do.
Help me!
True.
I don't know.
We can't.
I must go.
Well?
I'm going.
What for?
I'm tired.
What is it?
It hurts.
What?
Me, too.
Where?
No.
Who?
Not at all!
Why not?
Not now, not now.
Why?
Not so loud!
Yes.
Nothing.
You think so?

Players may start outside of the scene, entering at their leisure. Players may leave the scene whenever they would like. At some point, a player will say, "Yes, let's go." At this point, all players should be silent for a few moments, and the game is over.

# Dappled History

 
```
Gather: a blank map, drawing tools, at least yourself

Whoever last built something goes first.

On your turn choose 1:


- Add something to the map. It can be as small as a pebble or as big as a mountain. It could be a fence post or a fence, a tree or a forest. Just make sure that you leave room for others.

Tell us about the history or significance of what you added. A story, a memory, a fact, a rumour.


(After 2 rounds.)


- Introduce a character. Draw a symbol that represents them near a place they hangout. Tell us what they look like and a little about who they are.


- Add a new hangout for an existing character, with consent from whoever introduced them. Draw their symbol nearby and tell us a story they have of this place, and how they relate to it.


- Ask the group if they want to describe a story two or more characters with nearby symbols share and how they relate to each other. If everyone isn't on board, do something else.



When you run out of room or time, or grow tired or restless, give this place a name together and end play.

# In Love in a Movie

 
```
Players: One to four couples, and a GM
Aspects: Each person picks a pair of opposite traits, and their partner assigns them to the pair.
Scenes: The GM draws five playing cards and each couple draws four. Pick a couple to go first. Clockwise, each couple describes their scene. Once a scene, each couple or the GM can play a card and add a detail. Red cards are coincidences that promote love. Black cards hinder love. When a couple plays a card on their own scene, if the effect relates to a trait they have, they draw another card. Keep all the cards played in your scenes. After all the scenes, everyone discards their hand and starts the next scene type.
Scene Types: The three scenes are "Meet Cute," "Horrific Misunderstanding," and "Grand Gesture"
Finale: After the three scenes, add up each couple's red cards, and subtract the black cards. Couples with 0 or less points break up. The finale is a single scene with all the players at the wedding of the winning couple. If the winning couple has 0 or less points, they break up at their own wedding.

Nope. You are a cool Guy form an 80's action-movie protagonist. 
Cool guys don't look at explosions.

Write down these Traits: sunglasses type, wearing style, one-word backstory, catch-phrase.


HOW TO PLAY A SCENE?

Others play other characters and call for Conflicts. 
Just call a Conflict by saying, "No, and..".

Try to answer the scene question, end the scene when you do.
You may pitch more questions for playing more than four scenes.

# 200 Word RPG Challenge

 
```
The Challenge: Pick your favorite dice RPG; play as normal, but choose your words carefully because...
You must vocalize every action/attack that you make, and you can only utter 200 words total! Obviously, be as succinct as possible.

Words count if they are:
- describing an action/attack
- used in dialogue with NPCs

Words don't count if they are:
- anything OOC (table talk, jokes/banter)

Fudge Rolls:
Every time you use n>5 words in a situation, you can fudge the associated dice roll by ±(n-5). You can do this after the roll has taken place, even causing a crit after the fact!

Fire up the Auto-Canon:
If you use >=20 words, whatever you say is canonically true in-game.

"I shoot the caravan..." (n=4)
**rolls 14** miss!
"...with my powerful and dangerous heavy crossbow..." (n=11, +6)
**roll is now 20** crit!
"...Then the caravan suddenly explodes, instantly killing the corrupt merchants (n=20)
**it happens**

If you utter exactly 200 words with lots of time before the session ends, you can only win if your mute, action-less character survives to the end. Better hope your DM likes charades!
Over 200: you've failed.

Hardcore mode: All spoken words count
