# Pet, The Shadow

 
```
Humans never could prove the existence of supernatural because their pets fight the underworld everyday. You are a pet investigating and trying to stop darkness from destroying humankind. 

Choose a pet species and a name.
Describe the pet and it's background. Choose an extraordinary talent you're known for. You start with a 1d6 Darkness Dice at 1.

If you feel that you can fail at something, roll 2d6: 1-6 you fail; 7-9 you succeeds with a cost; and 10-12 you succeeds. If your background or species gives you some advantage, add 1 do the dice result. If is the case of disadvantage, less 1.

Everytime you find something supernatural or disturbing, roll your 1d6 Darkness dice. If the result is bigger than your actual number, add 1 to it. When you reach 6 you're lost and became a violent crazy killer beast. Create a new character, then. 

Magic can be used and it is connected with your talent, but it costs Darkness dice rolls, everytime. The Dark Plain can be seen when you reach 5 in Darkness Dice. Each game session your Darkness comes back 1.

# Braggart

 
```
Take turns telling fun, bizarre and over the top stories.
Each tale must contain one of each of the following plot points.
A Truth,    
A Lie
A big Exaggeration
The listeners writes down their private guesses for each and reveal them at the same time. Two points for each matching plot point, and one point for finding a plot point but placing it in the wrong location.
You then rotate to the next player who starts their tale, using the same system.
Repeat until each player has had a go, then tally up the points and find the winner/winners.

# The Realm Must Expand

 
```
In this game of three act mini-adventures the players become...

The Realm: Which details how it expands.  
    Be it peaceful or forceful.

The Outside: Where hardships the realm faces appear from.
    Be it nature or creature.

The Heroes: Who describe those rising up to protect the realm.
    Be they urchin or duke.

Starting from the top. When each player has added their ingredient the adventure begins.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Play the acts as vignettes focusing on:

I:  Heroes' origins.

II: Their journey.

III: The resolution.

Provide a description in order of:

The Heroes: How they progress in their quest.
The Outside: An obstacle in their way.
The Realm: Their support of The Heroes.

Act out each scene with heroes of course played by The Heroes, antagonists/nature the Outside and supporting cast The Realm.


Once the adventure is finished The Realm expands once more.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


"Wargame"

Draw:

###
#R#
###

Expand as Realm grows.

Assign influence:
# = 1d10+2
R = Pick


Realm spends influence from cells, expanding into others to capture.

Influence is adventure dice pool. Distill each act into one roll. Outside declares difficulty first.

Heroes pick 2 skills for permanent 1d10 bonus to relevant rolls.

Realm collapses at zero influence left.

# Quest Giver

 
```
The game is played over several rounds, each time a different player is the Employer, the rest Adventurers.

1) APPLICANTS:
In secret, each Adventurer writes a description of a character from any genre, eg:
	Paladin of the Luck God
	Ex-Military Robot Butler
	French Archeologist from 1924

Randomly assign these, ensuring nobody receives their own. Do not reveal them yet.

2) PITCH:
The Employer outlines a Quest, eg:
	Find a stolen spacestation
	Kidnap a dragon
	Become Mayor of London

3) INTERVIEW:
Adventurers announce who they are and attempt to convince the Employer to hire them. When ready, the Employer chooses a single Adventurer who receives 1 point.

4) OPTIONAL QUEST STAGE:
Starting on the Employer's left, each player except the chosen Adventurer:
	a) Describes a problem on the quest
	b) Adventurer says how they solve it
	c) Players who like the solution give the Adventurer 1D6
	d) Adventurer rolls those plus one additional D6
	e) Rolling at least one 5 or 6 beats the problem: Adventurer and Employer both receive 1 point
		
5) Play a new round, until everyone has been the Employer.


 The player with the most points wins, if you like that sort of thing.

# Suitimon Adventures

 
```
You and up to three friends are Suitors on an adventure to be the very best. To win game suitor must win a challenge (as challenger) with at least 30 experience points (exp). You can only have up to 35 exp and up to three captured suitimons. When deck is exhausted reshuffle the discard.


Type Chart:
Strong to>That
Spades>Hearts>Club>Diamond>Spades


Attacking:
To attack draw two cards, add values (face cards are five), and then modifiers: Plus two for each card strong against target. Minus two if weak. You may replace an attack card with a captured suitimon.


Suitors take one action per turn:

*Encounter a wild suitimon (draw a card) and do one of the following:

**Battle it by preforming an attack of at least ten to win exp in the amount of suitimon's value, otherwise you lose the exp. Must have a suitimon to battle.

**Capture it by drawing a card whose suit is not weak against suitimon. If card is weak you lose five exp.

*Challenge a suitor and bet five to ten exp. Suitors chooses a captured suitimon for the other to battle. Highest attack value wins the exp. Loser discards their suitimon.
