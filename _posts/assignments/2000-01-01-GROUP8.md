# Blood on Ministry's Carpets

 
```
3+ players
A D10 dice

One player gets to be a GM, others are 'janitors'

You work in the very heart of a totalitarian State - The Ministry. The Ubergeneral is going to visit soon but for some reason there's blood on the carpet near the conference room! And the worst of all - you've lost your keycard that allowed you to get into the technical zone, where the closet with all your stuff is situated.
 Players try to get the cleaning chemicals by all possible means - tricking the officer into believing they are high-ranked officials, crawling through the vents or just stealing keycards from others. GM sets the difficulty on 1-10 scale and janitors roll dice trying to get over the number. When players fail they are noticed by officers and can blame other players for their faults. If they don't succeed at convincing GM or if other player successfully blames them they get a 'warning'. After three warnings player is taken by the secret police. The janitor that actually cleans the blood stain is declared a 'National Hero'. 
When all the players are out or the carpet is clean, GM narrates Ubergeneral's visit and each janitor's fate.

# And Then We Were No More
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death of a people !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Let's tell the story of how our world ended. 

This game unfolds as a series of scenes played in reverse chronological order. 

= What You Need =

* 2-6 players
* Index cards
* Writing implements

= Starting =

Write "and then we were no more" on an index card. That is scene zero. The first player sets scene one, which is set just before scene zero, and each subsequent scene is set before the last.

= Your Turn =

Write on a blank index card:
* The new scene number
* A question the scene will answer
* Names of characters present

Write any other important details on additional cards. Each player chooses a character to play, and freeform roleplay begins.

__Every character must die in their first scene.__
Note that since scenes progress backward through time, characters may reappear in subsequent scenes.

When all new characters have died and the scene's question has been answered, the scene ends. Write the question's answer on the scene card, and begin the next player's turn.

= Ending =

Instead of their turn, any player may end the game (and begin the chronology) by writing "This is how our world ended" as the final card. 

Finally, read through the cards in chronological order.

# The Last Day of the Plague
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, sickness !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
It is the last day of the plague. Many have died, many more will. You will tell their stories.

Each player names one location in the town, then takes three six-sided dice.

Each player holds up a die, speaks a name. Say what they do, what they are like, one thing this person loves. Then place the die in the center.

Once all of the dice are in the center, roll them.

In the first round, the player who was sick last goes first. After, whoever took the lowest numbered die last round will.

The first player chooses a location, says what is happening there.

The player to their left chooses one person and one of the dice. Continue left, doing the same.

If the die is three or less, the person will die of the plague, a four or five, they will be murdered, a six, a tragic accident will befall them.

Play out a scene with these people meeting. Talk about what they love, talk about their hopes and dreams.

When the scene concludes, each player says how that person dies. Speak their last words.

Continue until all the dice are gone, their final stories all told.

# Two-Hundred Left Feet
A Monster-Making Game
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Possible body horror !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
1-6 players
10-40 minutes

You'll Need
1 six-sided die
Paper
Pens

Safety Tools
Open door
X-card

Monsters outgrow their bodies and need new ones. Some scavenge. Others cocoon. Some find Body Bogs-mires of ooze, body parts, and magic.

One found your Body Bog. It investigated. At last, it waded in.

What body will emerge?

* * * 

You're all playing as one Body Bog. You'll need perception, compassion-and luck-to help this monster. 
 
For each step, go widdershins around the group. Take notes.

1. Name a personality trait you each observed in the monster.

2. Write down an activity, sensation, or emotion it would like. Pass your paper left, unless you're playing solo.

3. Roll the die. 

1: Head
2: Torso
3: Limbs
4: Wings / Fins
5: Tail / Unusual Appendage
6: Whole Body / Magic / Area Effect

Describe what you notice about the new body part and how it'll help the creature experience what's on your paper. Repeat until everyone has gone at least thrice. 

If a body part wasn't rolled, your monster doesn't have it.

4. Draw or write about your monster.

5. Optionally, find your monster a friend at your gathering. Introduce the monster and offer the drawing or description.

# The Stuff of Myths and Legends

 
```
-----       -----
| | | TOOLS | | |
-----       -----
- 2 people, 
- one D6,
- paper,
- pen.


-----         -----
| | | PREMISE | | |
-----         -----
You're reviving an unknown myth. 
Decide who will channel:

- A Greek Demigod
- Fate

You're recreating this demigod's prophecised last day. 
Will they succumb to Fate, or defy destiny?

Let's roll!


-----                -----
| | | THE CHARACTERS | | |
-----                -----
Starting with the demigod and alternating, decide (elaborating generously):

- What's the demigod's name?
- What are they the god of?
- What's their dream? To slay, avenge, wed, voyage?
- What omen follows them? A symbol, creature, sound, word?

Decide together if this is a story of drama, humour, or poignance.


-----          -----
| | | THE PLAN | | |
-----          -----
This is it: the prophecised day.

Demigod: write, briefly, the 6 steps to fulfil your dream.
Fate: secretly, choose a number between 1-6.


-----               -----
| | | THE EXECUTION | | |
-----               -----
Demigod: Describe how you attempt step one. How are you feeling? 
Now, roll a D6.

Fate: Is this your number?
>>If so, describe how the demigod dies here. What happens afterwards?

>>If it's one higher/lower (e.g. you chose 6, demigod rolled 1 or 5), describe the close shave. Does the omen feature?

>> Otherwise, announce "...And it was as the demigod hoped."



Repeat until all steps are complete or the demigod is felled. 
Either way, congratulations:  they're the stuff of myths and legends.

# Rendezvous
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Heartache/emotionally heavy !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
To be played by two people, apart, who miss each other.
You once shared intimacy but haven't met in some time. Roll or decide:

How you were: quiet, desperate, transactional, awkward, cozy
Why you parted: growth, necessity, ambition, accident, death
What you can't talk about: loss, family, transition, betrayal, future
Where you meet now: the usual caf√©; the agreed-upon rendezvous point; the beach at night; the backyard of a house owned by one of you; a faraway airport 

Take turns describing something around you. What is it? What does it look, sound, feel like? How did it get here? Why does it catch your eye?

When something is described to you, it prompts you to (choose one):

Segue into a compliment
Describe a shared memory
Say something once left unsaid
Suggest something to do together
Close the distance between you
Avoid an unpleasant topic 

Once you choose, neither of you can react this way again. Now, you describe something. Repeat.

When all reactions are exhausted, decide privately whether you want to leave together or separately. Reveal your decisions. If you agree, describe the weight that has left your shoulders. If you disagree, describe who leaves and how.
