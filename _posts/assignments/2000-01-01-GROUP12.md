# Serendipity

 
```
You and your allies are doing something dangerous: navigating the dungeon, fighting the horde, settling the feud, etc.

You've come prepared, but you'll still need luck on your side.

As a group, determine the scenario, and elect a Guide to act in Opposition to the players' goals.

To start the game, every player rolls a die or flips a coin and records the result (odd/even | heads/tails). This is your lucky token.

Players start with 2 Objects of their choice and 3 Serendipity.

An Object: Anything you can hold in your hands.

At any point players may spend 1 Serendipity to:

Gain an Object - Retroactively explain how you obtained the item.
Know a Person - Declare your previous association with an individual.
Change a Fact - Point out an untruth, and how it affects the situation.

After doing so, test your luck:
Roll the die/flip the coin. If the result matches your lucky token, you succeed. If not, you fail.

On success: The state of the game changes in the way that you suggested.

On failure: The Guide explains how your Serendipity Complicates the situation further.

Play until out of Serendipity. The Guide then narrates an end to the scenario.

# Raccoon Island

 
```
You are smart wild animals on a tropical island with no big predators or regular human presence, except for some old ruins. Players pick one animal each to represent: bat, capybara, lemur, tortoise, raccoon. All animals can speak to each other, but not to humans. One of you is a game master who plays for environment and humans. 

Recently, humans arrived to your island and started building something. You animals are keen on driving them away!

During night, animal players describe what are they doing to scare away, misguide, sabotage or otherwise harass the humans in their camp. During day, humans go active behind scenes, possibly exploring, repairing or making traps against you!

To succeed at an action, roll 2d6. If you act like an animal, you succeed on 2-7. If you act in a non-animal manner, you succeed on 8-12. Doubles are complications, at GMs discretion. If you get help of another animal or reasonable advantage, you may reroll one of the dice once.

If animals make humans leave, they win. If humans complete their project and bring more humans to the island, the animals lose.

# Fantasy First

 
```
YOU NEED: 
1d6, at least 1 Player, you as Game Master

INIT:
Create(if you can) or remember a story with genre, that Players like. It can be a movie, a game, poem or just a short novell. Don't care about every detail, just be sure you can tell a basic plot

INTRO:
Choose suitable characters for Players. Tell Players about story world, epoch, region and their characters. Based on story, you tell just "you woke up at dark room", or give detailed description about character childhood. Don't create too detailed rules - game mostly about fantasy - give as much freedom as possible

GAME:
Story - pack of choices characters make. Every time Player needs to make a choice - ask him to roll a dice. Prepare to create a story reaction on that:

1 - bad decision with consequences
2 - bad choice, minor problems
3 - fail
4 - success
5 - success, small benefit
6 - great choice, good reward!

RULES:
none/any 
(Players decide what to do, you decide when they roll)

OUTRO:
Perhaps, it's a story without begin and end, but better create a final goal. F.e. survive for an hour in the world of Lovecraft or take control at Death Star

# Stories from the Toybox

 
```
You are children's toys acting out a child's fantasies.

Needed: 
    1 Magic 8-Ball
    3-5 people
    one d6 (optional)

As a table choose a Setting.
Each player chooses a Toy and a Role.

You may create your own Setting, Toys, and Roles, or roll below.

One player must play as the Villain and proclaims their evil goals to start the game. 

Players take turns framing Scenes that involve 1+ toys and a defined conflict. Once the Scene reaches a climax, ask the Magic 8-Ball a yes/no question about the conflict (e.g. does the cowboy catch the rustlers?). React to the answer appropriately. It is acceptable to end on a cliffhanger.

A Story has 3 Acts, and an Act consists of each player framing one Scene. The villain's scene goes last. Act 1 establishes conflict. Act 2 escalates danger. Act 3 resolves the story.

Settings

1 - Cowboys
2 - Astronauts
3 - Knights & Wizards
4 - Dinosaurs
5 - Pirates
6 - Cops & Robbers

Toys
 
1 - Stuffed animal
2 - Puppet
3 - Action figure
4 - Doll
5 - Vehicle
6 - Etch-a-sketch
 
Roles
 
1 - Hero
2 - Love interest
3 - Sidekick
4 - Authority figure
5 - Voice of reason
6 - Villain

# Two-Hundred Left Feet
A Monster-Making Game
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Possible body horror !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
1-6 players
10-40 minutes

You'll Need
1 six-sided die
Paper
Pens

Safety Tools
Open door
X-card

Monsters outgrow their bodies and need new ones. Some scavenge. Others cocoon. Some find Body Bogs-mires of ooze, body parts, and magic.

One found your Body Bog. It investigated. At last, it waded in.

What body will emerge?

* * * 

You're all playing as one Body Bog. You'll need perception, compassion-and luck-to help this monster. 
 
For each step, go widdershins around the group. Take notes.

1. Name a personality trait you each observed in the monster.

2. Write down an activity, sensation, or emotion it would like. Pass your paper left, unless you're playing solo.

3. Roll the die. 

1: Head
2: Torso
3: Limbs
4: Wings / Fins
5: Tail / Unusual Appendage
6: Whole Body / Magic / Area Effect

Describe what you notice about the new body part and how it'll help the creature experience what's on your paper. Repeat until everyone has gone at least thrice. 

If a body part wasn't rolled, your monster doesn't have it.

4. Draw or write about your monster.

5. Optionally, find your monster a friend at your gathering. Introduce the monster and offer the drawing or description.

# Feeding the Demons
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Trump reference !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
For 2+ players.

Gather at night. The Summoning will ease three negative emotions. Decide which emotions to bring with you: hate, greed, pain, sorrow, envy etc. Different players can bring different emotions.

Bring news articles / printouts of social media posts / books / flammable objects that evoke those emotions. These are your sacrifices.

Light an open flame. You will be burning things, so make sure it's safe to do so.

Say this together: "Scavengers and tricksters, accept our offerings. Dine on our scraps and lick our tears."

Go round the circle. Each player holds up a sacrifice and speaks according to this formula:
"Listen, you who [past action]. Behold a [description of sacrifice]. I charge you: [imperative action]."

For example: "Listen, you who forged speech. Behold a man with the best words. I charge you: curse his lies so that he must answer for them."

Burn the sacrifice. Together, say: "Hear our pleas and send us aid."

Move on to the next player. Save your most heartfelt sacrifices for last.

When all sacrifices are burnt, speak together: "Hidden, you swallow our hidden prayers. May your bellies be full and our hearts lighter."

Put out the flame.

# Our bed is but a mossy stone

 
```
we are gentle souls
we are hungry to help
we are only a single inch tall

for now



our wanderpod, numbering under six, seeks chances to sow joy*
when one of us acts, the others eagerly observe
but the oracle never acts
they are even more different than we are
they only reveal perceived truths about our surroundings


if the oracle foresees potential misfortune, we toss a mathstone
its twenty faces will reveal our future
the oracle determines which two demonstrated traits sway the mathstone
one sways upward
one sways downward


if above ten, the actor's intentions bear sweet fruit
if below eleven, trouble sprouts like tangled weeds
trouble respects our immortality
the oracle relays the actor's fate, whispered from beyond


if one makes a human happy*, they grow to double their size
our shape, though stretching, remains consistent
yet with every growth, our traits transform
all seed traits fall one step
all thorn traits rise one step


before our story began, we each chose how to distribute steps, crafting our uniqueness
twenty steps raised seed traits (nimbleness, awareness, caution, kindness) above zero
twenty steps lowered thorn traits (strength, reach, boldness, hunger) below zero


*after seven growths, consuming replaces delighting
