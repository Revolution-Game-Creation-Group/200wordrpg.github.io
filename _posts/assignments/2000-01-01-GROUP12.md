# Serendipity

 
```
You and your allies are doing something dangerous: navigating the dungeon, fighting the horde, settling the feud, etc.

You've come prepared, but you'll still need luck on your side.

As a group, determine the scenario, and elect a Guide to act in Opposition to the players' goals.

To start the game, every player rolls a die or flips a coin and records the result (odd/even | heads/tails). This is your lucky token.

Players start with 2 Objects of their choice and 3 Serendipity.

An Object: Anything you can hold in your hands.

At any point players may spend 1 Serendipity to:

Gain an Object - Retroactively explain how you obtained the item.
Know a Person - Declare your previous association with an individual.
Change a Fact - Point out an untruth, and how it affects the situation.

After doing so, test your luck:
Roll the die/flip the coin. If the result matches your lucky token, you succeed. If not, you fail.

On success: The state of the game changes in the way that you suggested.

On failure: The Guide explains how your Serendipity Complicates the situation further.

Play until out of Serendipity. The Guide then narrates an end to the scenario.

# Last Dance
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: The End of The World, Potential for Alcohol, Drugs, Sex, Emotional Trauma and Disclosure !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A game about music, reminiscence and the end of the world for 3-5 players.
The world is going to end at the climax of this party. As a group, decide why the party is happening, the host and who's attending. Players will be party attendees, the GM runs the world around them. 

Players and GM: create a playlist of 90-150 songs, together. Don't add more than two weird obscure songs only you know, mutual recognition is vital to the game. Three minute pop songs are ideal. 

When a scene starts, the GM describes a situation and shuffles the playlist. The players discuss why, right now, this song matters more to them than anyone else in the world. This can reveal their past, response to the scene or current emotional state.

Anything stated during scene framing by any player remains true. If players don't agree when the song ends, the GM decides who's argument is most relevant. The chosen player chooses how the scene resolves. Other players act as a supporting cast, hindering or assisting that player's resolution. 

After twice as many scenes as players, the world ends, and with it any of the conflicts at the party.

# The Antarctic Expedition

 
```
A GM-less horror storygame for 2 to 5 players. You are members of an expedition to Antarctica and discover an eon-old artifact in a cave a dozen metres below the ice. What will happen to you?

The Setting
Decide on the era, your gear and the actual goal of the expedition. Prompts: undiscovered local tribe, Victorian British explorers, modern-day scientists, visitors from another planet

Your characters
Each player describes their character in a few words, revealing their calling and discernible personality. Additionally, they privately decide how their character benefits from the expedition. 

The game
Decide as a group how the expedition went so far. Prompts: losses, weird findings or encounters,  uneventful

What does the artifact look like? Does it react to you finding it? Does anything change? 

You have a few in-game hours to interact with the artifact and find out what happens. After each hour the artifact, your surroundings or you will exhibit a dramatic transformation--what is it? At the end of the last hour everybody describes a short epilogue for their character and where they finally end up after the expedition.

If anybody died, hold a moment of silence for them.

# The cold grave
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Warning: This entry deals heavily with death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A dark tale for two players.

You're lost at sea, alone in the open water, struggling to survive. It's dark, it's cold. You're terrified. You must stay awake until rescue arrives.
As you slowly freeze, your hallucinated future self appears and urges you to keep fighting.

How to play:
In turns, draw a card and describes a memory associated with its theme. Future self describes events that have not yet happened to you.
When someone draws the card "Death?", decide together if you survive.

Cards:
Death? (epilogue)
A deal with God
Sunset
The most truly fantastic smile
Let me be weak
Not a soul, only me
Under the ivy
Wake up, sleepy head
A stone around my leg
Where the crossroads meet
Never say goodbye
I won't forget
Driving home
Murderer of calm!
Somewhere in the depth there is a light
Born again
Bad dreams
Three wishes
Joy and then more joy
Something moving under
I know your face well
The little line in my palm
Waking up crying
What made it special made it dangerous
I can't hide you
Something good is gonna happen
You don't hear what I'm saying, do you?
Peekaboo
Favourite place
Give away a secret
