# Lookout

 
```
Needs:
2-4 Players
A window that looks out on an active outdoor space

Everyone sit facing the window and look out.

The window is a view-screen showing a live video feed from a nearby camera.

The view out the window is actually (choose one):
- the area outside your spacecraft, which has landed on a distant world.
- the area surrounding a secret government facility.
- the view from a remote wilderness lookout post.

Translate the real-world things you see into things that would make sense in the scenario you chose. Buildings are huge mossy boulders, birds are distant or tiny spaceships, streets are mighty rivers, people are tumbleweeds, etc.

Watch the scene attentively, mostly bored and silent, sometimes chatting idly.

Occasionally, something real or imagined outside will concern one of you. When this happens, point to it and ask your fellow players, "Wait, what is that?"

The other players will look closer, then explain why the thing you see is nothing to worry about, and you all go back to idly watching.

The game ends when someone reacts to a concern by saying, "Oh, no..." or "Oh, yes!" and all the players rush out of the room to investigate.

# Voulez-Vous

 
```
This is a jukebox musical tabletop roleplaying game.

To start, decide on a playlist-create one yourself, or put an artist, album, or genre on shuffle.

Agree on a setting ("an island off the coast of Greece," "a caf√© in New York City," "a space station orbiting Venus"). Go as mundane or wild as you want, but make sure everyone's on-board. 

Go around the table hitting play on the playlist and listening to one song per player, then pausing. Everyone creates a character, using their song as inspiration.

Play out scenes as these characters.

When you're approaching a turning point for your character, or no one knows what happens next, press play and listen to one song. Don't worry about its literal content if you're not already familiar; focus on the energy.

Sing along. Have fun.

You can begin discussing the song while it's playing, or after. How does it fit into the current storyline? If it seems out of place, how does it actually make perfect sense? Describe visuals, choreography, which characters sing when. Anyone can contribute, but whoever hit play has final say. 

When you have a clear picture of the scene, continue as before.

# Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme

 
```
This game has two roles: THE LOVER and THE WORLD

LOVER: You are in love, but your love has refused you. Write down what they dislike about you on notecards (poor, short, cowardly, etc). They have given you an impossible task in order to win their hand, and you intend to see it through.

WORLD: You are vast and filled with magic. Many things seem impossible, but nothing is truly so, if one is willing to change. 

Each scene, THE WORLD describes a challenge THE LOVER faces on their quest. Together, you discuss how the challenge is resolved. If you cannot agree, flip a coin. At the end of the scene, THE WORLD gives THE LOVER a new notecard with a new quality on it- something they learned or developed from this challenge. THE WORLD may also take an old notecard away, if they feel the quality no longer applies based on THE LOVER's actions.

The game ends when all THE LOVER's original qualities are gone. Together, THE LOVER and THE WORLD describe how the impossible task was completed, and THE LOVER returns home a changed person, to decide if they still desire the love they have now won.

# Two Weddings and A Funeral

 
```
3+ players
 
-- First Wedding --
Each player writes, on a separate slip of paper, a type of wedding attendee: perhaps a member of the wedding party (e.g. bride, best man), a guest (e.g. groom's childhood friend, bride's uncle), or staff (e.g. caterer, DJ). 
 
Shuffle and randomly assign the roles.
 
Starting with the last player to attend a wedding, each player gives a short statement introducing their character and relationships to the other guests. The statement takes the form of an in-character public address to the assembled wedding attendees: e.g. a vow, a toast, a drunken outburst.
 
Once all players have made their statement, the first wedding concludes. 
 
-- Second Wedding --
Repeat the set-up to create a second wedding. Write and assign new roles. The roles may change, but the characters remain constant. Each player gives another statement, explaining to the second wedding's guests why their role changed. Other characters may respond.
 
-- Funeral --
Mark one slip of paper and randomly assign it to a player. Their character has died. The other characters eulogize at their funeral, reflecting on the momentous life events they shared. Finally, the departed character dictates their will, leaving one bequest to every character.
