# Lookout

 
```
Needs:
2-4 Players
A window that looks out on an active outdoor space

Everyone sit facing the window and look out.

The window is a view-screen showing a live video feed from a nearby camera.

The view out the window is actually (choose one):
- the area outside your spacecraft, which has landed on a distant world.
- the area surrounding a secret government facility.
- the view from a remote wilderness lookout post.

Translate the real-world things you see into things that would make sense in the scenario you chose. Buildings are huge mossy boulders, birds are distant or tiny spaceships, streets are mighty rivers, people are tumbleweeds, etc.

Watch the scene attentively, mostly bored and silent, sometimes chatting idly.

Occasionally, something real or imagined outside will concern one of you. When this happens, point to it and ask your fellow players, "Wait, what is that?"

The other players will look closer, then explain why the thing you see is nothing to worry about, and you all go back to idly watching.

The game ends when someone reacts to a concern by saying, "Oh, no..." or "Oh, yes!" and all the players rush out of the room to investigate.

# Arté Sophisphicateurs' Societé

 
```
Salut! The players are fellow-members of Arté Sophisphicateurs' Societé, whose raison d'être is to be the most vociferous critic in their clique.

Dress artsy-fartsy. Most stylish fellow gets a beret. Each fellow prepares 3 sheets of paper and a pen. Bring extra sheets of paper. Then, visit a gallery/museum!

Beret fellow chooses the first art piece to contemplate. Everyone secretly writes one adjective describing the art piece per sheet of paper they have. After a comfortable while, Beret fellow asks one fellow a question about the piece, who answers and asks another fellow (no asking back!). Repeat ad nauseam.

If another fellow mentions an adjective you have, reveal and strike-out that adjective, preferably with a snooty remark like "How hoi polloi of you!". If no one else has your adjective, tear a tiny piece of paper from the offending fellow . Mentioning your own adjective is a faux-pas.

After 8 minutes or when someone runs out of adjectives, the fellow with most torn paper pieces gets the beret + an additional sheet of paper and chooses the next art piece to appreciate. Repeat until ennui sets in.

Fellow with most torn paper pieces "wins" but everyone thinks they're nonpareil critics anyway.

# Just Survive

 
```
You all are trapped by Corruption, a thing that takes over and rots a person twisting them into a thing. Your goal is to Just Survive.

Build your setting - How did the Corruption start? Where are you? Where is safety? How did your group come together?

As a group pick 3 goals you must accomplish to escape to safety. 

Individually secretly pick a short & long term goal for your character. Each player roll a d12, that's how many hours you have to live it is your choice to share this or not. As you complete each goal roll the d12 to extend your life by that many hours. Introduce your character.

Actions are all considered contested, each side rolls a pool of d20 with the highest winning. The Corruption starts with d20 equal to the number of players. Add a d20 to the pool for each Player or Corrupted assisting sides. After a player has failed three times your character dies. When dead you turn into a Corrupted and work against the group. 

Roll only for actions where the outcome might produce an interesting result or the success of it will control if all in the group survives.

# Broken Memories

 
```
2-3 players, pen, index cards, one D6

One character is losing their memories. The other(s) (each) play a loved one.
Begin by defining character relationship(s). Then, take turns creating memories. Talk about the past of your characters, hopes and dreams, things that happened, things you did together. Write each memory on an index card, using as many words as you like. Stop when you feel like you have created enough memories: around 15 cards will work.

The one losing their memories begins. Roll the die. With 1-2, choose one memory and rip the card. With 3-4, choose two and with 5 or 6 choose three. If there are two loved ones, you can rebalance by ripping one memory on a 1, two on 2-3 and three on a 4-6.

The loved one(s) try to combat the memory loss. In turn, roll the die. Recreate a lost memory or create a new one, but you can only use as many words as the number on your die roll.

The game ends when all the memories are torn up. The person losing their memories might still be alive, but who they were is gone.

# Missing Parts

 
```
In Missing Parts you play broken robots in a scrap heap trying to repair themselves so they can escape. Robots can look like anything but always have thoughts and feelings.

A 52 card playing deck represents scrap parts. Your parts are always face up in front of you. 
Start by memorizing a part from the deck and shuffling it back in. This is your missing part.

On your turn, reveal one part from the deck, describe that part of you and why it evokes the following emotion:
SPADES - anger/frustration
HEARTS - connection/trust 
DIAMONDS - hope/joy 
CLUBS - sadness/despair  

Then choose an action and play a scene using the emotion:
SCAVENGE - take three parts from deck or discard, keep one 
SHARE - share a moment with another, take two cards and they take one
STEAL - steal a card from another 
TRADE - trade with another 
BREAK DOWN - discard four parts to take one from anywhere in the discard

When you obtain four-of-a-kind + your special part, escape the scrap heap. If you have four-of-a-kind but no special part, you may escape but you are broken and changed. When either happens, other players have one round to escape or they remain forever.
