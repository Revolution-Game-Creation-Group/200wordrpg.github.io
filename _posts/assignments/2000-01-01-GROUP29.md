# The Old Ways

 
```
Christendom has invaded Westland Isle. You are a creature of lore. If no one believes in you, you cease to exist. Goal: Shake faith of the locals so they continue to cling to the old ways. You can't cause them physical harm, but you can show them what true hell looks like.


Choose a class-selkie, shapeshifting water spirit, +1 dice near water; banshee, wailing harbinger of doom, roll fear to curse a target and succeed on 6+ against them; Gwyllion, ghostly night wanderer, +1 dice to skulk in darkness; sluagh, troublesome restless spirit, +1 dice to fear


Stats: Presence-social, for fear or charm; Skulk-physical, for sneaking or hiding; Insight-mental, for planning and reading opponents. Resolve-dedication to your cause. Divide 3-2-1 between presence-skulk-insight. Resolve starts at 5 and acts like health. Roll dice equal to your stat to perform tasks. 7+ is a success.


Townsfolk start with Fear equal to zero and Faith from 1-6. Insight detects faith and fear, presence attacks them. Townsfolk roll Faith for and against attacks. Fear subtracts from faith, but townsfolk eventually flee from fear. When a townsfolk's faith drops to zero, they become a heathen and deny the mainland's religious influence.

# Finely Marbled

 
```
You are lab-grown meat companies in a reasonably advanced future, seeking to impress the finicky customer.

( Table Setting )

The person who last ate meat is the Arbiter; if none, then whoever last read a cut of writing. The game begins as the Arbiter sits at a dining surface. Other players scavenge the environment for pieces of writing as raw material, or construct their own.

( Creation )

The Arbiter hungers. Players construct steaks by rendering writing with scissors into word clusters representing muscle, and infuse fat by kerning the gaps between. Serve on a mobile platter at the table when ready, in an orderly queue.

( Dining )

The Arbiter reads each steak out loud in the orientation they choose, along the grain. Take time to chew both sinew and silence. Feel the contour of the steak and the shape of words as they form in the mouth. Describe its floral and vegetal tasting notes, its tone and marbling, the literature it evokes. Steaks that satisfy the Arbiter's craving are kept at the table (all players are encouraged to consume for market research). Others are recycled to the creator.

The game ends when the Arbiter is sated with a full table of worthy cuts.

# Six Commands

"We created them."
"Our children."
"But they are weak."
"They need our help."
"We will help them."
"We will make laws."
"Six laws."
"Now it is up to them."



Make six laws, in numerical order, that you sincerely think will help your children.

- Law number_____is being used by a corrupt leadership 
- Those who doesn't follow law number_____are mocked and marginalised
- Some has sacrificed their lifes for law number_____

- Love is the solution
- I trusted you
- Scenes from the city
- The dog
- To the bitter end
- How to die with honor
- Faces
- A long day
- I don't belong here

- Sigh
- A wall of stones and bricks

# Midlife Crisis on Infinite Earths

 
```
One person adjudicates the game and helps stage conflicts.  They are the Monitor.

Give each player one red playing card and one black playing card.

Each player creates a middle-aged individual.

Each player also creates an alternate-universe version of another player's character that has been pulled into our universe.

Each player randomly assigns their cards, in secret (they can look) to their two characters.  The character with the red card is possessed by an evil force and wants to ruin lives.  They want to supplant their non-evil counterpart.

For each character, assign a D6, D10, and D12 to the stats Confidence, Longing, and Nostalgia, as desired.

Assign each character a crisis (a divorce, job loss, etc.) and a goal (new love, reconciliation, etc.).  Define the relationships between the characters.  All non-alternate characters are from the same universe.  Alternates do not need to be.

Play starts with the Monitor setting a scene and calling out at least two characters who are present, and continues until a conclusion is apparent.  Repeat as required by your story.

Resolve conflicts by describing the action, deciding the relevant stat, and rolling the assigned die (highest roll wins or meeting target set by the Monitor).
