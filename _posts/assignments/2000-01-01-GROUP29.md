# Après Moi Le Déluge

 
```
You represent a festering establishment. Like Icarus chasing the sun, you carry your people to their imminent and completely evitable demise.

Build a Jenga tower at the center of the table. You will destabilize this Regime, your people's tomorrow, for the sake of your own today. Consider Versailles, Babel, Krypton, Atlantis, environmental policy.

Describe your broad Domain, individual Titles, and decadent Vices. Take turns narrating and governing selfishly, or rule alone.

Whenever you:
...*Underestimate Suffering* or *Belittle Your Advisers*, pull a brick from the Regime. Place it in the Treasury.
...*Boast of Your Vision* or *Revel In Luxury*, construct Vanity Projects around the Regime's foundation using the Treasury. Build palaces, armies, idols, gardens. Dream of a legacy.

If a Vanity Project falls, blame it on a factor outside your control. Then, place its bricks atop the Regime.

When the Regime falls, the future you refused to see is now the present. Narrate how it all goes wrong. The game is over.

At any time, your dynasty can step down and hand power to someone more capable. Briefly narrate how they will be a force for good, then place one hand on the doomed Regime and shove it over. See above.

# THE SUN A WIDE-EYED PHOENIX IN ITS NEST
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: fictional animal slaughter !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
For one player.

Retha's community sucked its land dry. But, according to myth, if Retha slaughters the phoenix that wanders daytime skies, life will be restored.

Retha has an axe, a pair of wax wings, a breastplate, and no better ideas. They're currently hanging from the phoenix's talons.

As they act, roll six dice. If they used a tool, choose any numbers, then reroll all dice showing those numbers.

SCALING THE PHOENIX
If you didn't roll a...
    1: Retha falls off and plummets.
    2: Retha can't climb higher.
    3-4: There's no opportunity to strike.
    5: Sacrifice a tool.
    6: Retha's crushed, near-lethally.

STRIKING THE HEAD
Roll only three dice if you have no weapon. If you didn't roll...
    two 1-2s: Retha fall off and plummet.
    four odds/evens: Sacrifice a tool.
    two 6s: Retha can't make wounds last.

CHEATING DEATH
If you didn't roll a...
    1: The phoenix cries, anguished.
    2: We remember Retha as naive.
    3: We remember Retha as gullible.
    4: We remember Retha as weak.
    5: Retha cannot cheat death. (The game ends.)
    6: The myth is fake.

After two wounds, the phoenix plummets, a fallen star. Is life restored?

# TWO WORDS TOWARDS SPACE

 
```
Each player is a spaceship crew member, traveling through the deep space. Your hyperdrive knocked out and you can't do a hyperjump. The stocks of fuel and arms are minimal. Nobody considered a long flight. Fortunately, your mechanic is a gathering maniac and he got lots of stuff in the cargo. 

You have two main tasks: find some fuel to continue the flight, get something to defend the ship from the  threats of the space. From the start of each round, all players must write a two words on a different pieces of paper. This items they found in the cargo to help them push the ship forward and to defend it. All items mix in the common pile and everybody gets two items blind. Then players see, what they got and tell the story with this items helped to resolve two tasks.

The ship gets one damage for each item unused. This items get to the common area, so everybody can use them in their turn, unless they available. Nobody can't use identical words in one game. The turn passes clockwise. Each round you have only two items. Your ship can fit five damage. The mission is really important!

# Man is the Warmest Place to Hide
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: depersonalization, death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are a group of researchers in an isolated base. One of you is a Thing from outer space, hiding in the warm cocoon of a former friend. Draw lots to determine who. Keep your lot a secret.

Separate into pairs, and set a timer for five minutes. In those pairs, play out a scene set somewhere in the base, between yourself and another researcher. What role do you serve in the base? What do you do to relax? Do you know you are a Thing, and do you hunger for something more than your rations, something you cannot understand? 

Switch pairs every five minutes.

When the Thing grows restless, they may assimilate another player by shaking their hand. That player may go on to assimilate more people. If you do not wish to assimilate anyone, you may remain alone.

When any researcher (Thing or not) suspects another of being a Thing, they may shoot them with a finger-gun gesture, and remove that player from the game. The dead are not obligated to reveal if they were a Thing.

The game is over when all researchers are no longer themselves, or when only one survivor remains.

# An Old and Well-Worn Cloak

 
```
You will need 3-5 players, paper, pencil, eraser, and dice.

Draw a simple cloak. From the group, choose a wearer and an illustrator. Everyone else is the chorus.

The illustrator rolls a prompt, and alters the cloak's drawing accordingly. Afterwards, the chorus answers the first question, and the wearer the second. Choose a chorus member to be the next illustrator, and keep going. 

1: ADDITION. 
 - What purpose do the additions serve? 
 - Why were the changes needed? 

2: DAMAGE.
 - How was the cloak damaged?
 - Does this change the cloak's use?

3: WEAR & TEAR.
 - How has the cloak endured strain over time?
 - What stresses have been put upon the cloak?

4: AESTHETICS. 
 - Why was the cloak's appearance altered? 
 - How does the wearer now perceive themselves?

5: RECORD. 
 - Who marked the cloak?
 - Does the wearer know of this record?

6: INHERITANCE. 
 - How did the wearer part from their cloak? 
 - Who is the new wearer?

When INHERITANCE is rolled, the old wearer chooses a new wearer from the chorus, and then becomes the next illustrator. 

After every player has worn the cloak, the game is over. 

Note: this doesn't be played with a cloak. Try a sword, a crown, or a hand.
