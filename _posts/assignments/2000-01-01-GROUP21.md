# The Getaway
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, Robbery, Betrayal. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The heist went wrong, you got the goods, but you need to escape. A GM is required.

Everyone describes their character. What makes you useful?

Everyone decides on the following: 
What was the heist? 
How did it go wrong? 
What's the current getaway plan? 
Who is chasing you?

Take the face cards and jokers from a deck of playing cards, shuffle them and place them on the table. Everyone takes one, The players with Jokers are undercover agents. The remaining are removed.

Lastly, shuffle the remaining cards. Players are dealt five cards from the deck face-up. These are Stamina cards

If you do something dangerous and/or the outcome is unclear, roll 1d10. If you get an 8 you succeed. You can turn a card 90 degrees and add it's value to the roll. You exert yourself to accomplish your goal.

If you are badly hurt, turn the highest remaining card.

When all stamina cards are turned, you die.

An undercover agent can reveal their card during any roll and automatically pass. Now everyone knows who's side they're on.

Play starts at the point the heist went wrong.

Play ends when every character dies or escapes.

```
You are the Final Girls, last bastion of your fractured group left standing against a relentless killer. The killer will not rest until they, or all of you, are dead. But they don't win this time.

YOU NEED:
candle
dark room
six-sided die
red lipstick
2+ players

Light candle. Turn off lights. Take turns rolling the die and answering questions. Every time you answer, mark somewhere on your body with the lipstick.

1. What distinguishing characteristic of the killer's did you see? Where have you seen it before?
2. How did you narrowly escape this time? Why won't it work again?
3. What makes you stronger than people think?
4. What did you lose before you had nothing left to lose?
5. What about you is too messy, too broken, too much for most people? How has it saved you here?
6. How did you die?

When only 1 Final Girl remains alive, she blows out the candle and describes how she defeats the killer once and for all. Turn on the lights and celebrate your scars together.

# ROBOT FIGHT

 
```
Players:

Create a robot.

Divide twenty points into its Legs, Arms, Torso and Head. (minimum 1, maximum 5)

You have two legs and arms by default and you need to divide points separately into both.

Choose one module per location. Modules allow for subtle changes to rules: attacking with a location other than arms, attacking at range, etc.

Your Defence is equal to your current total in your Legs locations.

Name your Robot.

Fight:

When you attack roll 1d6+current total in Arms. If you roll equal to or higher than your opponent's Defence, you hit.

Roll 1d6 to determine hit location.
1. Left leg
2. Right leg
3. Left arm
4. Right arm
5. Torso
6. Head

By default, Robots can only punch. This can be changed with modules like weapons.

Attacks deal 1d6 damage. Deduct damage from appropriate location. If Head is brought to zero, your defence is halved and you must roll 2d6 to attack and use the lower. If Torso is brought to zero, your robot is destroyed.

GM:

Populate your world with robots for your players to fight and give them a reason to fight them.

Chew the scenery.

Hack.

# RPG FM

 
```
2 players
Any app where you can play music.

Introduction:

You live in a remote village. It's a nice place, but there's one thing that really bothers you; reception is terrible, there's one single radio network and it only plays an annoying loop where a dull voice reads the local news.

Talking with a friend you come up with a great idea, you'll start a local radio music show. After getting all the materials you meet at your house for your first show.

Rules:

The game starts with players picking a name for their show and defining its personality. Will they play all types of music? What's its logo? At what time will your show end?

Players take turns to play songs they like. Each song should be introduced by the player who chose it, either telling why that song is special to them or providing a fun fact about it. The show goes on following the structure agreed by both players (it could have special sections defined by them). The game ends at the time set by the players, who must say goodbye and remind listeners to tune in again next week.

# Ye gods!

 
```
You're a pantheon of capricious, bored gods who amuse yourselves by meddling in one mortal's day.

Each player-god is able to manipulate the world remotely, but mortals retain their autonomy.

Roll for each player's god-type: god of... (d6)
1 - Justice
2 - Love
3 - War
4 - Trickery
5 - Vengeance
6 - Snakes

Each player starts with 3 god points (gp).

Name the target NPC mortal, e.g. Chad. Play through a mundane event in Chad's life, e.g. morning routine, going on a date, doing photocopying. 

The GM narrates this event action by action. A player can spend 1gp to INTERCEDE and become active player. They narrate how they HELP or HINDER Chad at that moment, in keeping with their god-type. Active player then regains 1gp and rolls d6; other players can spend 1gp to modify this intercession by +1 or -1, explaining how they assist/impede the active god. 

4+: Chad succeeds
<4: Chad fails

Then the GM resumes narration until a player intercedes again.

If Chad gets 5 successes his event ends favourably. If he gets 5 failures he non-fatally fails. 

Players aim to manipulate Chad's life to get a conclusion that aligns with their god-type.
