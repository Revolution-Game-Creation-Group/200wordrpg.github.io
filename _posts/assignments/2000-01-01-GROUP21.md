# The Getaway
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death, Robbery, Betrayal. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The heist went wrong, you got the goods, but you need to escape. A GM is required.

Everyone describes their character. What makes you useful?

Everyone decides on the following: 
What was the heist? 
How did it go wrong? 
What's the current getaway plan? 
Who is chasing you?

Take the face cards and jokers from a deck of playing cards, shuffle them and place them on the table. Everyone takes one, The players with Jokers are undercover agents. The remaining are removed.

Lastly, shuffle the remaining cards. Players are dealt five cards from the deck face-up. These are Stamina cards

If you do something dangerous and/or the outcome is unclear, roll 1d10. If you get an 8 you succeed. You can turn a card 90 degrees and add it's value to the roll. You exert yourself to accomplish your goal.

If you are badly hurt, turn the highest remaining card.

When all stamina cards are turned, you die.

An undercover agent can reveal their card during any roll and automatically pass. Now everyone knows who's side they're on.

Play starts at the point the heist went wrong.

Play ends when every character dies or escapes.

# 200 Word RPG: The 200 Word RPG

 
```
You and any friends you can convince to sit down with you create your own 200 Word RPGs.

Using pencils and paper, write down the rules. Think about the rules for a long time, and how they make you feel. Award extra points to anyone who tears up, smirks knowingly, or otherwise silently demonstrates they're more emotionally connected or avant-garde. The rules themselves do not matter. No players should at any point converse with each other during rule creation.

Then, each of you takes turn being a judge. For any game that use dice, cards, or things you would expect to find in an RPG, roll 1d6 and assign the game that many points. For any games that use objects you would never find in an RPG, such as matchsticks, ice cubes, or used tissues, roll 1d6 and add 6. Double the points of any game if the subject matter is exceptionally ludicrous. No players should at any point converse with each other during judging.

At the end of the game, whichever game has the most points wins. Then none of you play any of the games.

Solo variant: The regular game will always be a solo variant.

# Sincerely Yours.

 
```
Put away all distractions (e.g. phones) in a bag.
Sit with other players all around the table and put a bowl at the center.

1. Each player writes anonymously a real secret about himself/herself, a confession, or a private thought (in no more than 20 words) on a piece of paper and put it in the bowl. Make sure that everyone uses the same pen color.
2. Shake the bowl.
3. Each player picks up a piece of paper from the bowl and reads it silence. 
4. Then each player pass the piece of paper to the player on the right until every piece of paper is read by everyone.
5. All the players must return all the pieces of paper in the bowl. 
6. One of the players lights up a match and throw it in the bowl, giving fire to the secrets that will vanish forever.

Now you got closer to your friends, you know their secrets. But you won't know who they belong to.

# Until the Spell is Broken

 
```
Your characters were magically cursed. Who or what was responsible? Was it the same for all of you? 

Roll d6s or choose. Consider what your curse says about you. Who are you? What should you learn? Have you accepted it, or do you want to break it? How does it affect your life? Make it as funny or dramatic as you like, but not too real: other people's lived experiences aren't for your entertainment.

What
1 - You become non-human
2 - You're still human, but something's weird
3 - A tether to something/someone/somewhere
4 - Separation from something/someone/somewhere
5 - Something happens to/around you
6 - Something doesn't/won't happen

When
1 - Periodically
2 - Certain physical/emotional states
3 - Gradually
4 - Always
5 - Someone else decides
6 - You try to talk about it

What you need to be free
1 - Love
2 - Atonement
3 - Vengeance
4 - A recipient
5 - Time
6 - An epiphany

Meet everyone else. Talk to and support each other. Confront whoever or whatever did this to you, if you want. Help each other break free, or make it easier to live with this.

# Moonsick Family
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Food !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Touched by Her Paw, you've grown up in a village, a pack.
Your coming of age was your first hunt; elation, terror, hunger, and *life* as you'd never known before.
Your whole family was there, running beside you.

Then, Hunters came, more every year, scattering your family.

Now, your pack is found-family.

Answer yourself:

- What terrifies you?
- What do you hunger for?
- Why do you risk your life?

Answer together:

- Why do you run together?
- Where are you going?

A large bag of sweet jerky, a small bag of spicy; cut into bite-size pieces; place in a bag.

You've two tracks, Hunger and Moonsick.

Rate challenges 1-3, 3 being hard.

Draw pieces = rating; if any are spicy, fail.

For every packmate who helps, draw one fewer.
Draw fewer pieces by increasing Hunger 1:1.

If Hunger reaches 5, you *must* transform.
Decrease Hunger by eating raw flesh while transformed.

You may transform at will. Lasts for Hunger minutes.
While transformed, succeed in all challenges.
After, increase Moonsick by 1 if voluntary, 3 if not.

If Moonsick reaches 10, you're forever the beast.
Decrease Moonsick by sharing a secret with a packmate.

Each session ends when out of jerky.
