# Paperwork

 
```
One player is a civilian that wants to get specific information from the database, and one is a bureaucrat that tries to deny him the request.
Both players agree on a time-limit in minutes.
The civilian then submits a request form for some specific information. 
The following steps then repeat:
1) The bureaucrat checks the form and requests exactly 2 different fixes. This step may not take more than 15 seconds.
2) The civilian submits a fixed form
The bureaucrat can't request a fix he already requested or that directly oppose an older fix and can't request a fix the civilian can't feasibly achieve in up to a minute of work.

If the bureaucrat made illegal requests/passed his turn time-limit 3 times or the civilian made successful fixes equal to twice the game time-limit, the bureaucrat concedes, giving the civilian the information he wanted. If the agreed time-limit is reached, reception hours are over and the civilian loose. If the civilian submits a form without a requested fix (even an earlier one) than it is fully rejected and the civilian loose.

Fixes examples: add another form, change pen color, change paper size, add missing information, change letters size.

# THEY // FEED

 
```
THEY eat people. THEY spread. Your group survived. Resources are scarce. The shelter depends on you.

Each survivor needs 1 long grocery receipt, pencil, d4s. Survivors start with (100 - receipt price total) luck. Who are you? Why do you protect the shelter?

-Round all numbers down

Goals:
-Scavenge supplies
-Avoid THEM. 

Each Day: 
(1) Traveling
(2) Scavenging
(3) Transporting
(4) Resting

First 3 phases:
-Player rolls d4 for an obstacle (THEM).
-Describe location, objects, obstacle.
-Each survivor strikes-through 1+ receipt items for an action. Describe. Add your prices.
-Roll (phase #)d4 for obstacle. Add all the d4s. Do THEY notice you?
-If survivor's price >= obstacle, survivor unnoticed. Move to next phase. 
-Noticed survivors must strikethrough receipt discounts to lower notice or lose luck = highest, two d4 rolled. Describe how.

Scavenging:
Survivors find goods. Spend luck = item price. Circle receipt items and price to acquire. Survivors narrate search. How do they feel about what they find?

Resting:
Survivors hand out goods. Strikethrough circled items. Each survivor gains luck = (combined receipt item prices / player count). Narrate survivor's interaction with shelter people and group. Who are they?

Strikethrough items are gone.

0 luck or receipt items = survivor dies. Narrate their end.

# Why Does Someone Always Die at Dinner?

 
```
All Players play a character at a dinner party where someone is murdered.  Over the course of the night they must learn about each other, hunt for clues, and find out who's the murderer by rolling the dice and telling a cooperative story in phases.  This is a role-play and story-telling centric game.
Phase 1: The Introduction:
Each player rolls a d6.  The number indicates the number of pieces of personal information about their character they must include in the conversation as the party-goers meet each other.  
Phase 2: The Murder:
The players find the body and search for clues to what happened.  Each player rolls a d6.  The number determines how many clues each player adds to the story.  Players bring forward their clues to the group in character.
Phase 3: The Intrigue:
Each player rolls a d6.  The number rolled determines how many additions or rebuttals they are allowed to make related to the clues found in phase 2.
Phase 4: The Parlor:
All players act out the parlor scene to decide who the murderer is based on the clues, information, and rebuttals brought forward in the first 3 phases.  Dramatic finger pointing and gasping is encouraged.

# Last goodbye
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Infection, desease, death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You've been infected and in a few hours you could either turn into something or die.

Take a piece of paper, this is your last diary.
Take a pen and write 2 or 3 short sentences about what happened.
What infected you and how? How do you feel about it?
Fold the diary and put it in your pocket. 

During the next few hours whenever you take a break (coffee, lunch, toilet, etc.), remember your diary.
Find a pen and add a detail by writing 2 more sentences.
Choose from:
- Were you with someone? Where were you?
- How did you react? What were your thoughts?
- What were you doing when this happened?
- Did you try to hide or cure the infection?

The longer the day goes on, your writing becomes illegible due to infection getting worse.
In order:
- You'll not be able to use punctuation.
- Only verbs, nouns and adjectives.
- You'll confuse the words and no longer write them in order.
- Use only a few letters of every words.

When you have written the 4 details the game ends and you will no longer be human.
Scrawl now the last words to say goodbye to someone.

# Rogue Demon Hunters

 
```
You are Rogue Demon Hunters. You do not hunt demons. 

NOTE: Demons can be anything.

One player, the MARK, offers a quest: Hunt the DEMON.

Don't. 

Return to the Mark. Make up a story.

   Your character has a fake Persona: [Name] the [Adjective] ("Yoksur the Mighty"), with a fake backstory.
   Skills: BOAST, FLEX, and FAKE. 
   Choose: two are 1d6, one 2d6. 
   5-6 = success.

   Boast: lie stylishly.
   Flex: demonstrate prowess. 
   Fake: provide "proof" (demon head, etc.). 

Demon Ratings (The Mark decides): 50+. 50 = easy. 1,000 = legendary.
The Mark can challenge your facts, your prowess, or require proof. 
Roll one skill to convince. 
Succeed and earn WOW. The Mark decides how much. 1 = barely, 5 = completely.
Faked proof can be retconned into existence.
When WOW > DR, receive gold = WOW / 5, or continue for more.
If you fail a roll, gain DOUBT, 1-5 (the Mark's choice). When DOUBT > WOW + 5, you fail.
For every successful hunt, gain 1 FAME. 
For each unsuccessful hunt, gain 1 INFAMY. 
If INFAMY > FAME, leave town and create new persona.

Spend gold on glitzy fake gear. Every 5 gold spent = 1 reroll on a failed convince. 
Spend 20 gold to lose 1 Infamy.
