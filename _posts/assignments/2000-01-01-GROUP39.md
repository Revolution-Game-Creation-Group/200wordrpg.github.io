# Paperwork

 
```
One player is a civilian that wants to get specific information from the database, and one is a bureaucrat that tries to deny him the request.
Both players agree on a time-limit in minutes.
The civilian then submits a request form for some specific information. 
The following steps then repeat:
1) The bureaucrat checks the form and requests exactly 2 different fixes. This step may not take more than 15 seconds.
2) The civilian submits a fixed form
The bureaucrat can't request a fix he already requested or that directly oppose an older fix and can't request a fix the civilian can't feasibly achieve in up to a minute of work.

If the bureaucrat made illegal requests/passed his turn time-limit 3 times or the civilian made successful fixes equal to twice the game time-limit, the bureaucrat concedes, giving the civilian the information he wanted. If the agreed time-limit is reached, reception hours are over and the civilian loose. If the civilian submits a form without a requested fix (even an earlier one) than it is fully rejected and the civilian loose.

Fixes examples: add another form, change pen color, change paper size, add missing information, change letters size.

# Interdimensional Battle of the Bands

 
```
REQUIRES: 1 MC, 1+ Players, 1 Deck of cards, 1 die for each player

Radical! Your band just qualified for the Interdimensional Battle of the Bands! Name and Describe your Band!

ATTRIBUTES:

Players start with 1 point in HYPE, HEART and SKILL, then distributes 6 more points between them (max 5). 

NPC bands are built the same way.

NON-COMBAT:
 
HEART = Social 
SKILL = Physical

Roll under your Attribute to succeed. Roll the exact amount for a critical success!

BATTLES:

Players and MC draws cards equal to their HYPE. MC starts playing a song.

On each players turn they turn over a card and roll against the MC.

RED cards roll HEART
BLACK cards roll SKILL

The goal is to roll higher than the MC, but less than or equal to HEART or SKILL. Rolling higher counts as 0.

Whoever has the highest result is the winner and keeps the card.

If it's a tie, either can use one of their HYPE cards to roll the attribute attached to the HYPE card. Winner keeps all cards played, other cards are discarded.

When the song ends, measure the Applause-O-Meter! If the players have more cards than the MC, they win the battle.

# The Gentlemen's Discourse

 
```
Each player takes two red tokens and three blue tokens. 

Starting with the oldest player, they will choose another player to challenge to a battle of "wits." 

The Challenger is trying to defame the Defender, who is trying to protect his honor. 

The Challenger starts by making an outlandish and scandalous claim; for example, "I saw you at the party coveting the Queen!"

The Defender will try to rebuke that statement by creating an equally outlandish alibi; for example, "I would never! It was a masquerade!" 

The Challenger gets a final chance to try and defame their opponent. "That's how I know it was you, you weren't wearing a mask!

Other players may interject with added details by spending one of their blue coins; for example, "Yes, I remember you drank yourself silly before meeting her."

At the end of the round, the other players will vote on if the challenger or the defender had the most compelling argument. 

Whoever is right wins the other person's token. 

The game ends when only one player remains with red tokens; The Master of Gentlemen Discourse!

# My Red Goddess
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: noir stereotypes, violence, romantic relationships !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Two players, poker deck, index cards. Everyone gets the cards between brackets.

  * Her: femme fatale (Q Hearts, A Hearts, A Diamonds);
  * Him: detective (J Spades, A Clubs, A Spades).

Describe:

  * Her: in velvet and roses;
  * Him: in smoke and grey.

She sets the scene and hires him to find something important, personal, and stolen.

In conflicts the last word is:

  * Hers: mind and heart;
  * His: body and violence.

Before every scene, she deals one red and one black card face down, then writes and hides an index card under each:

  * Red: a secret about her;
  * Black: a clue about the case.

  He taps one, she sets the scene. He plays the detective, she plays other characters. She reveals the secret or clue he tapped.

Play scenes until three secrets or three clues are revealed. She sets a scene in which they confront each other.

She gives him her Aces, he gives her his Aces. Both play one.

  * A Hearts, A Spades: she loves but kills him;
  * A Hearts, A Clubs: they love each other, but cannot stay together;
  * A Diamonds, A Spades: he gets paid, she'll never love again;
  * A Diamonds, A Clubs: he gets paid, she's framed by justice.

# 002: License to Eavesdrop

 
```
  
You and your Partner: secret super-spies.

The next social gathering that you both attend: a Mission.

While out in public (perhaps en route to Mission) listen for Code Words. When you overhear a seemingly random phrase that sounds like it might be your Code Words, confirm it with your Partner. Then, your Partner does the same. Each of you arrives at the Mission with personal Code Words.

Give the Code Words as a sign-without tipping your hand to Enemy Agents, who are everywhere.

Mingle at the gathering within earshot of your Partner. Work your Code Words naturally into conversation. If the person you're speaking to treats the Code Words as normal, you've successfully given the sign to a Contact. Give the Contact the Agency-approved confirmation signal (a friendly smile).

If the person you're speaking to reacts as if the Code Words/your behavior are odd, you've been caught by an Enemy Agent! Your Partner steps in to cover for you while you find a quiet corner of the gathering and whisper into your watch (or microchip embedded in your wrist) "Cover blown, extraction requested."

If both of you keep your cover, whoever gave Code Words to the most Contacts wins.
