THE SAILOR'S LAST SONG

An erotic roleplaying game for two or more
by Steve Dee

One Player is the Sailor. Their hands are bound (loosely) and their eyes are covered.

They begin with a song:
"I am a sailor, lost at sea
I wish my love was here with me
Afore this watery death I die
One last song to her I'll cry"

The sailor then describes what he would do if only their love was there. What they might wish to do as a last parting gift.

The Other Player(s) are the Water Spirits. Hearing the sad yet powerful song, they respond to show their enjoyment. But being made of water, they cannot speak or touch. They can only respond with what they are: wetness.

The greater the story appeals to the Spirits, the more moisture they might perhaps apply.

When the story is over, the Water Spirits kiss the sailor as he dies. 

Swap roles.

# Medusae Menagerie

 
```
A gang of Medusae. Going to the Opera.
Each player rolls for hair type in secret (expand the table at your discretion):
1. Snakes
2. Gooses
3. Wasps
4. Worms
5. Octopuses
6. Suricates
Petrifying gaze and charm apply to all.
Medusae and players can't look at each others heads during the Opera.

The Opera is divided in three Acts.

Act one, Presence. Go in rounds, one-by-one, complimenting each others appearance.
Heads are a sensitive area to avoid.
Compliment for 10 minutes, or until a Medusa takes more than 2 seconds to come up with one.
If the latter, that Medusa has to leave the Opera.

Act two, Invitation. A ticketing fault duplicated invitations. Randomly pair Medusae in twos.
Each pair has to agree on who gets to seat and attend the Opera. The Iron Butler can be called, but he won't help.
If after 5 minutes there is no agreement on who leaves, both do.

Act three, Performance. Each Medusa secretly writes on paper an adjective describing the Opera.
The Medusae have 2 minutes to ask each other questions that can be answered with yes/no.
If they find the description, the remaining WON.
Otherwise they all LOST.

# This place

 
```
A long time ago, you lived in this place. A long time ago, too, but a few decades more recently, you died here. 

You have been watching ever since. Much has changed. 



Discuss what "this place" will mean for this session. Be open to sharing what excites or discomforts you; be equally open to hearing this from your fellow players.

Here are some starter ideas:

-a floating river-city now beset by rot and flu
-protecting the guardian dragon
-the slow inroads of deer and creeping vines
-the trial and exile of the final monarch
-a people among the stars

Expand on ideas as much as you like. Continue developing "this place" until you feel happy with it, and ready to play in its space.



Then, taking turns, choose an element to put the spotlight on. Feel free to name and choose something new.

Time ticks on. Tell what's happened, using your result as broad, impressionistic inspiration.

Roll 1d12.

1: Sudden, drastic ruin.
2: Inevitable reclamation.
3: Slow coming-apart at the seams.
4: Palimpsest.
5: Delicate new life.
6: Resurgence.
7: Working together.
8: Staying apart.
9: Dogged perseverance.
10: Betrayal.
11: Blood.
12: Thin hope.



Continue play until done.

# The Truth about Jevallik: A Game for Two

 
```
Servant's Rules

You're a recent convert to Jevallik's Servants.

Love motivates you to share the truth door-to-door despite the controversies. You had a scary experience at the last door. What happened?

Knock to begin. Introduce yourself, your mission, and the peace of Jevallik.

Whenever they make an objection, the objection is partly true. Choose one to begin your response, each exactly once:

-Well, what the scriptures say is:
-That bothered me at first. Think of it this way:
-The media has exaggerated this a bit. Here's the truth:
-Jevallik's servants are imperfect too, but here's what I think:
-I don't believe that, but here's what I do believe:

Convince them to hear more about the Truth.


-----

The Unconverted's Rules

You're at home when a crazy Jevallik's Servant knocks on the door. What were you doing? 

Something about them makes you think you can help them start to break free.

After they introduce themselves, make an objection and let the Servant answer. Make five objections, either about:

-Something controversial their organization did 
-A bizarre belief you heard about

Whatever you say is true, but listen politely to the Servant's answer. Be gentle.

Convince the Servant to share their doubts.

# Confused Detectives

 
```
A mystery for 3+ players.  You need pens, paper, index cards

You've come together to solve a mystery.  Together determine who/what/where you are (hard boiled gumshoes, a Japanese Attorney and crew, military investigators...).  
After, figure out what crime you are investigating (murder, theft, missing person...).  
Individually, take 6 index cards and fill out the following:
   2x Clue/evidence - Fingerprints, a scrap of paper with something written
   2x Witness - A neighbor
   2X Suspect - An estranged spouse, an angry business partner, a rival
   2x Motive - An upcoming contest, an inheritance

After everyone has filled out their cards shuffle them all together.  

Play begins and one player draws a card and interprets the scene.  Everything they provide about the card is true but not necessarily relevant to the investigation.  Play the scene with the other players asking questions, interrogating, or otherwise exploring the information.  When satisfied, the next player draws a card and they frame the next scene.  Play continues until everyone has had two chances to frame scenes.  After the final card scene the detective team determines how they think the crime occurred, motives, perpetrators.  Did you solve the crime?  What are the results?
