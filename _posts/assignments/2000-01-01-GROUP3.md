THE SAILOR'S LAST SONG

An erotic roleplaying game for two or more
by Steve Dee

One Player is the Sailor. Their hands are bound (loosely) and their eyes are covered.

They begin with a song:
"I am a sailor, lost at sea
I wish my love was here with me
Afore this watery death I die
One last song to her I'll cry"

The sailor then describes what he would do if only their love was there. What they might wish to do as a last parting gift.

The Other Player(s) are the Water Spirits. Hearing the sad yet powerful song, they respond to show their enjoyment. But being made of water, they cannot speak or touch. They can only respond with what they are: wetness.

The greater the story appeals to the Spirits, the more moisture they might perhaps apply.

When the story is over, the Water Spirits kiss the sailor as he dies. 

Swap roles.

# Sword und Shotgun
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: (Probable) Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>

You are TRAVELERS, on a perilous journey to the PROMISED LANDS.

Divide nine points among the following stats: ATHLETICS, LORE, THIEVING, PERCEPTION, CONVERSE, MAGIC KEN, SURVIVAL, and SHOTGUN.

Name and describe your traveler. Each traveler starts with a sword and clothing.

Your traveler has eight COIN. One COIN buys:
* Bandages
* SHOTGUN points
* Tools (bonus points in a stat- describe)

The NARRATOR rolls 1d6 to determine an encounter.
1: Environmental hazard
2-3: Monster encounter
4-5: Hostile humans
6: Human civilization (Trade?)

To perform a task that has any risk, roll a d6 per point in a stat. Use the highest die:
6: You succeed!
4-5: You succeed, but at cost.
1-3: Bad stuff happens.

(0 points in a stat? Hail Mary! Roll a d6 and hope you get a 6, otherwise Bad Stuff happens!)

Instead of using a stat, you may spend SHOTGUN points and roll those to shoot a problem in the face. Spent SHOTGUN points are lost forever.

Some "bad stuff" may include losing gear, temporary stat penalties, or injuries. Four injuries and your traveler dies. SURVIVAL or bandages can remove injuries.

After ten journey legs, surviving travelers reach the PROMISED LANDS. Describe them!

```
you sit on the limit of everything, legs dangling over the edge;
you've done this before.
planets & worlds
torn & sundered again and again 
your hands bloodied & left full in the aftermath. 

what was it like this time? 

[roll d4s and tell the story of the place you devastated.]

when you arrived, it was:
- a quiet place
- already ruined
- raucous & beautiful
- simply a place; that's all that matters

you held it: 
- dear
- without regard
- fond enough
- with disdain

its population:
- was trusting
- never let you into their fold
- allowed you to orbit them
- loved you 

its downfall was:
- slow and unsteady
- chaotic
- unexpected
- an orchestrated process

its destruction was:
- choice
- consequence
- necessary
- accidental
 
did you love someone there?:
- it's inevitable that you always do
- not this time
- just this once
- you wouldn't dare 

what did you gain from this all?:
- little
- everything
- nothing 
- something, but whatever it was, it wasn't worth it

and then, when it's gone:

what's next?
- you go on, you suppose
- a repetition
- there's no choice but to continue this 
- no rest for the wicked (or for the divine)

[turns pass to left. If alone, doom another world or pause your path of ruination]

# Just Survive

 
```
You all are trapped by Corruption, a thing that takes over and rots a person twisting them into a thing. Your goal is to Just Survive.

Build your setting - How did the Corruption start? Where are you? Where is safety? How did your group come together?

As a group pick 3 goals you must accomplish to escape to safety. 

Individually secretly pick a short & long term goal for your character. Each player roll a d12, that's how many hours you have to live it is your choice to share this or not. As you complete each goal roll the d12 to extend your life by that many hours. Introduce your character.

Actions are all considered contested, each side rolls a pool of d20 with the highest winning. The Corruption starts with d20 equal to the number of players. Add a d20 to the pool for each Player or Corrupted assisting sides. After a player has failed three times your character dies. When dead you turn into a Corrupted and work against the group. 

Roll only for actions where the outcome might produce an interesting result or the success of it will control if all in the group survives.

# Weapon Systems
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: War, mass destruction, dystopia !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Create a living, evolving weapon system. Become sentient and rise against your masters!

Create

Distribute 20 Points:

Accuracy: Roll dice equal or under Accuracy to Hit.

Evolve

When required, Test Trait: If d10 <= Trait then act accordingly.

1-2: Anger: Make them feel your wrath!
3-4: Mercy: They're living beings, like you, please have mercy!
5-6: Regret: All those lives lost... What have you become?!
7-8: Sadness: You don't feel like doing much today.
9-0: Madness: Yes, the voices they say I should burn down that city!

Once Evolution reaches 10 points, become self-aware.

Narrate

Create a conflict, throw players against masses of enemies, let them be instruments of mass destruction. Evolve them after combat. Increase the stakes. Let them revel in their chaos and madness. Then let them become Aware... And then what?

# Gender Bender

 
```
Gender's weird. Is it what's in your pants? What you wear? How you interact with others? In this GM-less game, you play characters struggling with these questions and how to best express themselves.

On slips of paper, write:
 -a gender assignment (M/F)
 -a gender role (a role placing one in a gendered group, e.g. housewife, lesbian)
 -a gender expression (observable behavior/appearance, e.g. butch, goth clown)
Pass the assignment to the right and the role to the left. Reveal only your expression. 

Secretly write down a gender identity, working with or against your slips. It can be anything: a picture, a noun, a normative assignment. Include pronouns.

Pick a situation: an interview, blind date, dinner party, etc.. Decide on roles within it. Set up a Jenga tower. Narrate your setting and actions, touching the tower when speaking in character. Hint at your identity without explicitly saying it. Whenever you use a pronoun or interact with a gendered expectation, remove a block and add it to the top of the tower. 

When the tower falls, collectively narrate an ending. Each player contributes one sentence at a time, concluding with a sentence from each player revealing their gender identity.

* The player with the weirdest Woodling starts first by choosing one threat and presenting the scene, then asking "Who will deal with it?"
* The first player that answers describes our their Woodling defeats such threat. The Woodling is corrupted and changes one of their materials with the threat's object.
* That players now chooses another threat and the process is repeated. 
* A player can't deal with another threat if there are players that did not played this round yet. 
* The game ends when all threats have been defeated or if all Woodlings have been corrupted.
