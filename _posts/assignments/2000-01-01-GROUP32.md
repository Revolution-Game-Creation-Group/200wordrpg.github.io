# DELIRIOUS WITCHES
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Witchcraft, Black Magic, Mind Games, Occult Ritual !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```

a para-roleplaying game,
destroy your friends,
in real life,
with black magic!
A 'game' for two or more 'friends'
  
Our players, the Delirious Witches, will actually perform black magic rituals and spells of their own devisal in attempts to curse each other and to discover their own latent magical abilities. Out of courtesy the Witches will let their cursee know what ritual has been performed and what it's effect will be. Fortunately, this allows counter-rituals to be done to negate the curse. 
This is not a letter writing game, magic must be performed for the game to work. Increase the efficacy of your curses through progressively elaborate ritual and esoteric research. There will be an effect - even if unintentional. 

Example messages-  
"I have blackened a needle in candle-flame and thought of you meeting a spiteful stranger"
"I have stared into a dark mirror till my face became a spirit's, I told him of you, expect nightmares"
"I walked through the woods at night singing your name, all the creatures that lurk and crawl in the forest know you now"

The game ends when one Witch is too spooked, or both Witches become truly delirious and a truce is agreed.

# Advent

 
```
"There are only bodies and languages, but there are also truths." --Alain Badiou

This is a game of microhistoriography. It is concerned with the emergence of complex and compromised subjectivities in times of crisis and revolution. 

To begin, describe the situation. For simplicity, limit your description to the following four conditions: science, art, politics, love. Provide as little or as much detail for each as you feel is necessary. 

Pick one condition to experience a rupture. A rupture is the event of a truth appearing in the situation. A truth is that which transforms the terms of the situation. 

This transformation occurs in four distinct stages: nomination, intervention, fidelity, forcing. This is the truth-procedure, the process by which bodies are made into subjects.

Nomination (the event is named). How does language change?

Intervention (the event is elaborated). How is life impacted?

Fidelity (the event is solidified). How do you orient yourself toward it?

Forcing (the situation expands according to the event). How do you find your place?

When the truth-procedure is finished, discuss how it will be remembered in five years, fifty years, five hundred years. 

All this is an experiment in the eternal.

# The House Wins
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Gambling, Addiction !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The person running the game is The House. All other participants are Players.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players:

Roll on each row of the wealth table, then answer the following:

-What was your first big win?
-Why do you need a win so badly?
-How much will be enough?

There are three rules all Players must follow:
1) Every hand you win, state a dream for your future.
2) Every hand you lose, state something you missed or lost while playing.
3) You may not willingly leave the table while you or The House has money. If asked to leave the table, justify why you are staying.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The House:

Decide on the game to be played. Blackjack is recommended. Bet in $1,000 increments.

The House begins with $100,000,000.

After each hand, gently encourage one player to leave the table.

You may choose to end the game only once you have decided that all Players have nothing left to lose.

# The Struggle

 
```
Vvvvzzzzwhomp.

You have been materialized on this plane by The Coordinator, to delay The Great Calm.

Your attributes are MIND, BODY, and SOUL, each beginning at 2d6.
Choose something you can do using your best attribute that no one else in the cosmos can do.

Roll 1d6, 2d6, or 3d6 under the relevant attribute to attempt something easy, challenging, or extreme.

You have HP equal to BODY; attacks deal 1d6 damage and always hit.
Roll 2d6 under MIND to act first in a scramble.
When a hit takes you below zero HP, roll 3d6 under SOUL or cease to exist.

You may repurpose a captured artifact from The Calm into a single-use reality spike that guarantees success at a specific activity; decide what that activity is when you construct it.

Whenever you thwart a Lieutenant of The Calm, reduce your best attribute by 1.
Whenever you succumb to temptation, increase your best attribute by 1.

If you succeed in your mission, you cease to exist.
If you fail in your mission, everyone else ceases to exist.

When you cease to exist, make a wish.
Occasionally, wishes are granted.

# Zombie Mall
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Zombies  !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
3-8 Players are trapped in a mall defending zombie attacks.

Start the game with 2 store catalogs and 1D8 for each player. Each catalog represents a store in the mall.

DAY: players can take 8 actions:

Move: to an uninhabited store

Shop: choose products in their store, cut them out from the catalog. Players can hold 5 products.
Trade: choose a player and agree to trade any products you are holding.

Eat: Remove an edible product from inventory

Barricade: remove a product from inventory, explain how it will help your defence. Players rate your product 0-3.
Record the average rounded down as the products defense rating.

NIGHT: players add up the defense ratings and $ value of all products in their barricades. Minus 1 defense rating for each eat action below 3 taken during the day.

Players, in order of the cheapest to the most expensive barricade roll a D8 and choose a player to attack. Roll result is number of Zombies attacking. If number of Zombies exceeds defense rating player is killed.

At end of the night all barricades are discarded. Killed players become zombies and may choose to reroll and redirect 1 attack per night.

# Cooking RPG

 
```
Chose who is the best chef among you, they are now head chef the rest are sous chefs.

Head chef 
Baking: 11
Cutting: 13
Frying: 10
Plating: 4
Mixing: 5
Other: 11

Sous chef
Baking: 14
Cutting: 16
Frying: 13
Plating: 6
Mixing: 7
Other: 14

Choose a recipe, any recipe.

For each step of the recipe roll a D20 for the corresponding skill. Roll above or exact to pass. This is for every step from prepping the ingredients to plating. 

If you fail the roll you must mess up that step. It doesn't matter how you mess it up, but you have to mess it up. The head chef gets final say as to how to mess it up. 

If you roll a 20 you perfected that step, and no one can say otherwise.
If you roll a 1 you completely fail that step, more so than you would have you only failed the roll. Please no bodily harm or setting very large fires.

Enjoy the food you made.

# Imposter

 
```
You remember nothing. The three faces look intently at you. Your dissertation defense committee. A Reader says, "The title of your dissertation is..." and they tell you the title, but you remember nothing. 

One player is the Student, three are Readers. The Student is doing their final defense of a doctoral dissertation, but they have forgotten everything about it. The Readers should leave the Student alone to create a dissertation title that the player playing the Student knows nothing about. After telling the Student the title, the Readers ask questions of the Student about the dissertation. The questions should be specific and leading. Readers can ask as many questions as they want. Take turns. When all three Readers are satisfied, they decide if the Student passes or fails. It must be unanimous, or the Student fails. 

Reader Advice
Everything you say is true, even if it is contradictory. Prove you are the expert. Add pieces to the dissertation and ask the Student to explain them. Create a theory and ask why the Student didn't consider it. Say, "I see," a lot, ominously. 

Student Advice
No one can help you. Godspeed.
