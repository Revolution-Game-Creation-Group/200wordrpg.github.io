# DELIRIOUS WITCHES
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Witchcraft, Black Magic, Mind Games, Occult Ritual !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```

a para-roleplaying game,
destroy your friends,
in real life,
with black magic!
A 'game' for two or more 'friends'
  
Our players, the Delirious Witches, will actually perform black magic rituals and spells of their own devisal in attempts to curse each other and to discover their own latent magical abilities. Out of courtesy the Witches will let their cursee know what ritual has been performed and what it's effect will be. Fortunately, this allows counter-rituals to be done to negate the curse. 
This is not a letter writing game, magic must be performed for the game to work. Increase the efficacy of your curses through progressively elaborate ritual and esoteric research. There will be an effect - even if unintentional. 

Example messages-  
"I have blackened a needle in candle-flame and thought of you meeting a spiteful stranger"
"I have stared into a dark mirror till my face became a spirit's, I told him of you, expect nightmares"
"I walked through the woods at night singing your name, all the creatures that lurk and crawl in the forest know you now"

The game ends when one Witch is too spooked, or both Witches become truly delirious and a truce is agreed.

# Vile Villains
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
1 GM, 3 Evil Players. 
---
If you have 0 HP at turn start, roll a d6. On a 1, you die. HP can't go negative.

At combat start, roll a d6 + HP, going highest -> lowest for turn order.

To attack (1 attack per turn), roll a d6 against a target within range ('target:') they roll too. If you roll lower, nothing happens. Otherwise, you damage it.

You can move 30ft per turn.
---
Players:

-Deathknight. HP 5. You have a sword (3 damage, target: within 5ft). When it kills, you regain 1 lost HP.

-Blasphemer. HP 4. You have magic gifted from a god (2 damage, target: sight). You can heal 2 lost HP to a target you can see in addition to attacking, you must kill to heal again.

-Necromancer. HP 3. You have innate magic (1 damage + 1 curse, target: sight). You make a friendly zombie by touching a corpse instead of attacking.

    Curses:
      - Next attack automatically hits it.
      - Next attempted attack does double damage against it.
      - Subtract 2 from its next attack roll
---
GM: 

Enemies have statistics formatted like players, with unique attacks. Example:

   Zombie. HP 1. The zombie bites (1 damage, target: within 5ft).

# (don't) fight Suzanne: an autobiog-rpg

 
```
Sit in a circle. We each play an expert fighter, and each take turns playing Suzanne. Choose your expert's area of martial expertise, or roll a d6 on the list below:
     1. Jiu-jitsu
     2. Capoeira
     3. Krav Maga
     4. Muay Thai
     5. Taekwondo
     6. Bare-knuckle boxing

Decide who will be Suzanne first. Suzanne attempts to challenge the expert to her left to a fight. Suzanne is an ordinary, small-ish and not particularly strong or coordinated woman. If the fight occurs, Suzanne will definitely be knocked out, and almost no one wants that. 

-Expert Fighters: Try to talk Suzanne out of fighting you, by whatever means you see fit: reasoning with her, convincing her to fight someone else, demonstrating your superior martial prowess in indirect ways, distracting her, etc. 

-Suzanne: You can probably take any of these chumps. It would probably be fun. Try to convince the expert to your left to fight, just for the hell of it.

After two minutes, or Suzanne is convinced to move on, play passes left; the last fighter becomes the new Suzanne, and challenges the expert on her left. Play until everyone has been Suzanne, or Suzanne has been knocked out.

# TWO WORDS TOWARDS SPACE

 
```
Each player is a spaceship crew member, traveling through the deep space. Your hyperdrive knocked out and you can't do a hyperjump. The stocks of fuel and arms are minimal. Nobody considered a long flight. Fortunately, your mechanic is a gathering maniac and he got lots of stuff in the cargo. 

You have two main tasks: find some fuel to continue the flight, get something to defend the ship from the  threats of the space. From the start of each round, all players must write a two words on a different pieces of paper. This items they found in the cargo to help them push the ship forward and to defend it. All items mix in the common pile and everybody gets two items blind. Then players see, what they got and tell the story with this items helped to resolve two tasks.

The ship gets one damage for each item unused. This items get to the common area, so everybody can use them in their turn, unless they available. Nobody can't use identical words in one game. The turn passes clockwise. Each round you have only two items. Your ship can fit five damage. The mission is really important!

# Manus artificis in caelis: WIZARD EDITION

 
```
To play, you will need 1-5 players, one four- and one twenty-sided die per player, and a large pile of other dice.

Each player builds a Wizard Tower by rolling and stacking dice. If you wish, you may speak in character as your Wizard.

Players take turns building their towers. To build a tower, roll a die, add a description based on the die rolled as described below, then add that die to the top of your tower. Roll and stack your d4 to complete your tower.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you roll a ____, describe _______:
d6: the tower's appearance
d8: the tower's residents
d10: a collaborator or rival of your Wizard
d12: a magical feat of your Wizard
d20: your Wizard
d4: your Wizard's legacy
Other: minor magical mishaps or mayhem

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You get a number of words of description equal to the result of the die roll.

If you tower falls, accidentally or on purpose, describe the downfall of your Wizard  You may choose to start again with a new Wizard. Knocking over another Wizard's tower intentionally is grounds for banishment from the realm.

To play competitively, the first person to finish a tower with die rolls totaling 50+ wins.

# Out of Time

"Only you can save us," an older version of yourself said.  "I didn't, but you can." He handed you a book and a die as he faded away.
