# Caveman's Quest

 
```
You are a caveman (3HP). Go around circle; give names. The Chief (GM) hands you each 1 stick (twizzlers) and 1 stone (smarties) - your starting tools (1 DMG). "+" on 1dF = hit. The land called "home" has no game. You must find new home.

On first leg of journey, you encounter (1dF):

(-) sabretooth (5 HP, 2 DMG)
(0) brush fire - players roll (1dF); "-" means they are burned (-1HP)
(+) river - players roll (1dF); with "-" they get sick (-1 HP)

You stop and stare at mysterious boulder (GM hands each "string" - strawberry laces).  You realize 2 rocks grind herb (heal 1HP), 1 stick and 1 rock make axe (2 DMG), and 2 sticks make spear (free attack). You may trade tools only while at rest.

On second leg of journey (1dF):

(-) you see light in sky - (1dF) on a "+" Chief is taken
(0) mammoth (16 HP, 4 DMG)
(+) thunderstorm! (each roll 2dF); "--" you drown, "-" lightning strike (-2 HP), "0" tree hits you (-1 HP), "+" tools swept away, "++" climb to safety

If still alive, you find cave high in mountain - new home! Celebrate by eating your tools.  Don't eat the Fudge.

# Hundreds of miles to Safetown (200 Days)

 
```
It's hundreds of miles to Safetown.
It'll take 200 DAYS to get there, maybe longer.


Choose a PARTNER.

What brought you together?
Why can't you stay?
How will you get there?


Not every day is eventful. To PASS TIME, both roll a d20.

The DIFFERENCE is how an EVENT affects your partnership.

    When the DIFFERENCE is less than SEVEN, the EVENT brings you closer together.
        Something makes your day.

    When the DIFFERENCE is SEVEN or more, the EVENT drives you farther apart.
        Something important is lost or broken.

    When you roll the same number, you enjoy the peak of your relationship.
        Something in your chest expands.

    When a 1 and 20 are rolled, the EVENT creates an unmendable rift.
        Something will never be forgiven.
        Leave your PARTNER behind.

Create EVENTS together and overcome them together.


The SUM is how many days pass after the EVENT. PASS TIME until 200 DAYS have come and gone.

Complete the journey.


-: Optional EVENT Aid : draw inspiration for each rolled digit (20 = 2 and 0) :-

0   a FRIEND            1   a STRANGER
2   a BEAST             3   a PLANT
4   the NIGHT           5   the WEATHER
6   our FOOD            7   our GEAR
8   the PAST            9   the FUTURE

# No Honor (Among Thieves)
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: PVP !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Introduction
------------
  Pull off heists and get the most cash!


First Game
----------
  Characters are created as newbies. 

  The first heist is robbing a convenience store. Shares are $200. 


Setup
-----
  Newbies get double the share value for their bidding cash, Pros get triple, and the Ringleader get quadruple. 

  Each player proposes a problem. Each of these problems are marked down in whatever order the group decides.  


Play
----
  Problems are resolved one at a time. First, players with incapacitated PCs each add a complication, then the remaining players agree how their PCs will resolve the problem. After this, each player declares a possible outcome to the problem. 

  Each player bids by secretly writing down their desired outcome and their bid. All bids are revealed at once. The outcome that wins the bid goes into effect, and all bids are subtracted players cash. Ties are broken by additional bids. 

  Begging, bribing, and backstabbing, other players is encouraged!


Advancement
-----------
  If the PC survived they become a Pro. The PC that survived with the most bidding cash left over from the heist becomes the Ringleader. Otherwise the player must make a Newbie. 

  Finally the Ringleader chooses the next heist target and the new value of shares.

# The Ultimate Kraken Festival
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Ocean, Aquatic Life, Abyssal Gigantism !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The table works to appease The Kraken. 

Gameplay is two parts: First, players gather items to appease The Kraken. Second, players ensure the success of the annual festival. 

The game only needs 1d6+(stat mod) rolls to complete easy(5), medium(6), or hard(7) tasks. DM can increase difficulty.

Character Creation: Roll 1d6 for each stat-this is both total and modifier.
Arms
Noggin
Squish
Hide
Swim
Style
Morals

Part One
DM tells a legend that indicates the Kraken's likes & dislikes. Based on this legend, the players announce what they will each gather for the festival. Players can help each other-or sabotage each other if they think another player's idea won't appease. The DM presents at least one obstacle for each effort to gather.

Part Two
Players attend the festival and must ensure optimum festivities. Each must contribute to the festival in some way. DM presents one problem at the festival per player.

Ending: Kraken Judgment
At the appropriate time in the festival, the Kraken evaluates the offerings gathered and the quality of the festivities. If the Kraken is appeased, the Kraken slumbers for another year. If the Kraken is displeased, there is a Kraken Rampage.

# The Panopticon Must Fall

 
```
Write down your Faction's name and Plan to break free of the Overseer's tyrannical rule. Also write down, "My faction's base is on floor __ of Paradise, but when the Overseer checks the camera feeds for my floor, it Thinks It Sees floor __." Put the same number in both blanks. 

Each turn, you can either Comply, Conspire, or Rewire Cameras. Discuss it, then declare simultaneously.

If you Conspire, gain one Preparation. If you Comply, you are safe. If you Rewire Cameras, pick two Factions. They switch the floor number that the Overseer Thinks It Sees for their floor.

At the end of each turn, everyone who Conspired points to the faction the Overseer Thinks It Sees for their floor. Those faction are raided. If you are raided and didn't Comply this turn, you are Purged. Change your faction's name and Plan. Set your Preparation to zero. 

Once you have 4 Preparation, you enact your Plan. The game ends. The factions with 3 Preparation become the new order. Factions with 2 Preparation are torn apart in the turmoil. Factions with less Preparation are lost to history.

For a longer game, randomly determine if Plans fail. Failed plans get your Faction Purged.
