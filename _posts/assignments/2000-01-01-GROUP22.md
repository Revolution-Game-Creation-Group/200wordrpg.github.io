# Caveman's Quest

 
```
You are a caveman (3HP). Go around circle; give names. The Chief (GM) hands you each 1 stick (twizzlers) and 1 stone (smarties) - your starting tools (1 DMG). "+" on 1dF = hit. The land called "home" has no game. You must find new home.

On first leg of journey, you encounter (1dF):

(-) sabretooth (5 HP, 2 DMG)
(0) brush fire - players roll (1dF); "-" means they are burned (-1HP)
(+) river - players roll (1dF); with "-" they get sick (-1 HP)

You stop and stare at mysterious boulder (GM hands each "string" - strawberry laces).  You realize 2 rocks grind herb (heal 1HP), 1 stick and 1 rock make axe (2 DMG), and 2 sticks make spear (free attack). You may trade tools only while at rest.

On second leg of journey (1dF):

(-) you see light in sky - (1dF) on a "+" Chief is taken
(0) mammoth (16 HP, 4 DMG)
(+) thunderstorm! (each roll 2dF); "--" you drown, "-" lightning strike (-2 HP), "0" tree hits you (-1 HP), "+" tools swept away, "++" climb to safety

If still alive, you find cave high in mountain - new home! Celebrate by eating your tools.  Don't eat the Fudge.

# 200 Word RPG: The 200 Word RPG

 
```
You and any friends you can convince to sit down with you create your own 200 Word RPGs.

Using pencils and paper, write down the rules. Think about the rules for a long time, and how they make you feel. Award extra points to anyone who tears up, smirks knowingly, or otherwise silently demonstrates they're more emotionally connected or avant-garde. The rules themselves do not matter. No players should at any point converse with each other during rule creation.

Then, each of you takes turn being a judge. For any game that use dice, cards, or things you would expect to find in an RPG, roll 1d6 and assign the game that many points. For any games that use objects you would never find in an RPG, such as matchsticks, ice cubes, or used tissues, roll 1d6 and add 6. Double the points of any game if the subject matter is exceptionally ludicrous. No players should at any point converse with each other during judging.

At the end of the game, whichever game has the most points wins. Then none of you play any of the games.

Solo variant: The regular game will always be a solo variant.

# CAT vs GHOST

 
```
For two players

One of you is a CAT. One of you is a GHOST. The ghost is haunting the house where the cat lives with some PEOPLE.

Choose a name, pronouns, and one short tag to describe yourself. Together, describe the house and the people who live here.

Cats can be SMART or FIERCE. Ghosts can be SPOOKY or SNEAKY. People can be SCARED or COMFORTED.

The ghost begins by describing how they haunt the house. They should set up a problem for the cat. The cat then either chooses how they address the problem (smart/fierce) OR how the people react (scared/comforted). The ghost chooses the other. Both players make their choice, then reveal them. The cat describes how they handle the problem, consistent with what was chosen (e.g. fierce and comforting). Based on the cat's narration, the ghost assigns them another tag.

Now the cat sets up a problem for the ghost, to be resolved in the same way: the ghost chooses either how they address the problem (spooky/sneaky) OR how the people react (scared/comforted).

After six scenes, evaluate how the people feel. Decide together how they address the situation.

# One Must Ascend

 
```
You are a God - describe your aspects (Fire, Love, etc.) - Start the game with a pool of ten power tokens.

Take one action per turn:

War: Pick someone; your followers fight theirs. Both describe how and where.

Divine Council*

The winner rolls 2d6, the loser 1d6 - whoever rolls highest takes the difference, in tokens, from the other.

Worship: add one token to your pool.

Quest: Describe your hero and their quest and add up to three tokens to it. Any other god may describe a challenge for them to face. The questing god then describes how the hero tackles it.

Divine Council*

Hero wins - add one token from the challenger's pool to the quest.
Challenger wins - Take one token from the quest and add it to their pool.

Repeat until no more challenges are offered.
The questing god then doubles the tokens, adding them to their pool.

Ascend - Commit any number of tokens. Any god may commit tokens to cancel yours out. If any remain at the end, you win. All tokens committed are removed from play.


*All gods not involved must decide who wins, by majority. No draws allowed. The council can demand more description to decide.

# A Game of Cards

 
```
Required: Deck of playing cards, Notecards, Pencils
All players sit in a circle or around a table. Every player but one receives a notecard. They write one defining character trait on the piece of paper then pass it to their left. Each player writes a second trait on the card they received then pass it on. Each player writes a name on the card they receive then pass it.
The player with no character is the storyteller, the players with notecards play the character on their card. 
Everyone is dealt eight playing cards. When a character faces an obstacle, they and the storyteller each play a card. If the storyteller's card is lower, the character succeeds. The cards are discarded.
When a player runs out of cards, they draw eight more. If the storyteller runs out of cards, all characters and the role of storyteller get passed to the left, and the previous storyteller draws eight new cards.
When all cards have been drawn, discarded cards are shuffled into a new draw pile. At any time, a player may play a joker or four of a kind. All cards are reshuffled and players draw new cards.

# Final Voyage

 
```
Year 2122, pollution, global warming, and rapid population growth have planet Earth on the brink of destruction. Over the last century, scientists from around the world have gathered a vast amount of information regarding potentially habitable planets around the universe. However, with most of these planets being so far away, there's no telling for sure how hospitable these new worlds will be to human life. A group of interstellar explorers from different countries and with different skill sets is assembled, they are not the first team to take on this important mission, but previous pioneers were never heard from again. They will navigate the stars on a newly developed spacecraft capable of safely traveling through our known universe, complete with identified galaxies, black holes, constellations, and other wonders and dangers of space. The crew will have to deal with common problems like overcoming mechanical, interpersonal and health issues as well as more serious problems like contamination, mutiny, radiation, meteors, black holes, and many other mysteries of space. The goal of the game is to navigate through space by evaluating clues, avoiding catastrophes, and using the strengths of your crew members to locate and colonize a habitable planet, a new earth.

# Entmoot

 
```
You are tree-folk gathering to share stories of your kin.

Entmoot requires fallen leaves. It's best on a windy day surrounded by trees, friends, and little else.

Pick a leaf. Damaged gnarled shredded desiccated is best.

It's a record of your family. Find a rib with defects. Your kin's story.

Look up at the tree. Your kin. Its movement. Shape. Imagine how they walk. Speak. Watch. Their name.

Follow the rib. Tell your kin's story in turns.

A forking is a sapling's birth. What were they taught they began their wanderings?

A spot is conflict. Who or what did they encounter? Did they quarrel?

A hole is adventure outside the forest. What new things did they see, achieve?
(Lay your leaf over another's, positioning the adventure over their rib. What was their kin doing? How were they involved?)

At leaf's edge, tell of your kin's death.

If it's worm-eaten, they were consumed. By what? Were they resentful, or happy to provide sustenance?

If it's curled, they were felled. Were they cut, or toppled in a storm?

If it's browned, they burned. What grows from their ashes?

When you're finished, find another rib or leaf, another kin. Tell their story.
