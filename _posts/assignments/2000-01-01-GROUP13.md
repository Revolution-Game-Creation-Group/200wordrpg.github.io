# The Tyrant's Dream

 
```
The players are Magi in the decadent court of a furious Tyrant. You wear silk robes and smell of incense. Aside from your wisdom, you are helpless. You start with five tokens.

Start the scene by writing down an event in secret. ("Noble blood spills", "Poor harvest", etc)

Starting with the player who slept latest today, take turns describing an image in the Tyrant's dream (a rose, a coyote, etc) linked to your secret event.

In the same order, choose if you wish to spend a token to declare that a certain subject is banned due to the Tyrant's anger.

Take turns giving prophecies based on the dream. If anyone mentions a banned subject, they must spend a token.

Share your secret events. As a group, select two Magi: the Favorite, who gave the kindest prophecy, and the True Prophet, who gave the most correct prophecy.

The Favorite takes half the tokens spent this round, and describes what the Tyrant does.

The True Prophet takes the other half, and describes what happens in the country.

The next scene begins. When a Magus runs out of tokens, they still participate. The game lasts until the country falls.

# Heavy Words

 
```
#mood
A dark cloud floats above your head... the desire you've left drifts away from your body. You try to move, but your limbs don't respond to your commands.
You're somehow trapped inside your own mind. To set yourself free you need to find the word that keeps you prisoner.

#setup
One of the players will be the "Word Keeper" [WK]. The other(s) will be "Prisoner(s)"
Each Prisoner picks a stone. They write on its surface a word with meaning.

#gameplay
Wk is responsible for:
*Creating the world and filling the scenario with surrealism
*Setting obstacles to prisoners
*Asking the prisoners some questions (specially "what do you do?")

Prisoners: 
*Play to escape reality and surpass WK's obstacles by answering the questions they are addressed
*Can't show the written word to other players
*Can't say their own written word! 

#end
While playing, if WK says the Prisoner's word, the stone is shown and the word is revealed.
Prisoner shows the importance of that word to him (by telling a flashback episode).
WK ends the narrative (by telling how that word sets the prisoner free).
The stone is thrown away as far as it can and the game is over.

# The boys are back in town

 
```
A game for 1+ players.

The boys are eldritch entities who return to town once a year, heralding the arrival of summer. But who are they? What do they want? What will happen?

Blast your favourite song. Pour drinks. Spread the word: they will be here soon.

Round 1
1. "Wild-eyed and dressed to kill." Describe the Boys. Are they human?
2. What is the last death you remember happening when the boys were here?
3. Where do they go each year? Why does summer always return with them? Does it?

Round 2
1. They're looking for you. Why? Where are you?
2. "You're cool, you're red-hot, you're steaming." What powers does this give you?
3. You slapped a Boy once. Why? What happened?

Round 3
1. The Boys are at their usual place in town. Where?
2. The Boys want to fight. Who? How does it go down?
3. What happens to the town now that the Boys are back?

# Alien Shotgun

 
```
5 Players 

Prep: Arrange 5 chairs in a car layout, driver's side slightly ahead of shotgun. Have 5 playing cards, identify one for the driver, one for the alien. Shuffle and deal cards out, driver sits in driver's seat, alien silently reveals themselves to passengers, tells everyone else where to sit.

Setting: June 1947, on a road on the outskirts of Roswell New Mexico, late at night.

The driver of the car is suspicious that one of their passengers is an alien. But the passengers are under the alien's control, they're not allowed to reveal the alien's identity.

Play: The driver must keep looking forward, eyes on the road thank you, and can only talk to the passengers about idle chit-chat. The alien must give orders to the passengers silently, hand gestures, mouthed words, whatever. Passengers must follow these as best they can, but do nothing else. Every 5 minutes, the alien can knock out one passenger via the cut-throat gesture.

At any time, the driver can kick one passenger out.

If the alien is kicked out before all passengers are knocked out, driver/passengers win. If a passenger is kicked out, or all passengers knocked out, the alien wins.

# Amnesia Assassin

 
```
Pick who the assassin will be this round and have them go out of the room. Establish where you are, what jobs you have, who is the boss, and what you are doing. Decide a certain obscure action for the assassin to do to prove their an assassin, this will come into play. Start pantomiming typical actions that would occur at this location and job. Have the assassin come back in. They have to assimilate with the group, blend in with their surroundings, and get the feel of the place. They have been sent to kill the leader of this group, but have lost their memory. Without being suspicious, they have to ask questions and figure out what's happening, then identify who the boss is and kill them by saying their full title. Ex. "I assassinate you, the judge!" The other players try to win by getting the assassin to do the predetermined obscure action the group agreed upon, and therefore blowing the killer's cover.

# The Waiting Room, Your Partner is in Surgery

 
```
1 player, 3-10 hours

You're in the waiting room. Note the time. Write a letter to your partner about their best qualities. Check the time. Wait until 1 hour has elapsed. Things run long: wait d6 more hours.

Write your dreams for the future. If you leave the room, you'll miss the surgeon coming out.

Why the delay? Was there a transfusion? What blood type is your partner? Can you volunteer your blood? Do you know your blood type? Could you give them your blood, or would it poison them?

At the adjusted time, you're told everything's fine. You'll see your partner in d3 hours.

Nothing's perfect. How does your partner annoy you? Have you written anything after the surgery?

Tear the letter to pieces and discard them. Begin a new letter. Write how your partner disappoints you in small, everyday ways. Tell them why you can't forgive them. Be mean. Consider giving the letter anyway.

When 5 minutes remain, discard this letter.

When 1 minute remains, write a letter about your love. You can't finish it. You are escorted to your partner's room. Do you discard this letter or deliver it?
