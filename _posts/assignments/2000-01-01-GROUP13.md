# The Tyrant's Dream

 
```
The players are Magi in the decadent court of a furious Tyrant. You wear silk robes and smell of incense. Aside from your wisdom, you are helpless. You start with five tokens.

Start the scene by writing down an event in secret. ("Noble blood spills", "Poor harvest", etc)

Starting with the player who slept latest today, take turns describing an image in the Tyrant's dream (a rose, a coyote, etc) linked to your secret event.

In the same order, choose if you wish to spend a token to declare that a certain subject is banned due to the Tyrant's anger.

Take turns giving prophecies based on the dream. If anyone mentions a banned subject, they must spend a token.

Share your secret events. As a group, select two Magi: the Favorite, who gave the kindest prophecy, and the True Prophet, who gave the most correct prophecy.

The Favorite takes half the tokens spent this round, and describes what the Tyrant does.

The True Prophet takes the other half, and describes what happens in the country.

The next scene begins. When a Magus runs out of tokens, they still participate. The game lasts until the country falls.

# Last Dance
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: The End of The World, Potential for Alcohol, Drugs, Sex, Emotional Trauma and Disclosure !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A game about music, reminiscence and the end of the world for 3-5 players.
The world is going to end at the climax of this party. As a group, decide why the party is happening, the host and who's attending. Players will be party attendees, the GM runs the world around them. 

Players and GM: create a playlist of 90-150 songs, together. Don't add more than two weird obscure songs only you know, mutual recognition is vital to the game. Three minute pop songs are ideal. 

When a scene starts, the GM describes a situation and shuffles the playlist. The players discuss why, right now, this song matters more to them than anyone else in the world. This can reveal their past, response to the scene or current emotional state.

Anything stated during scene framing by any player remains true. If players don't agree when the song ends, the GM decides who's argument is most relevant. The chosen player chooses how the scene resolves. Other players act as a supporting cast, hindering or assisting that player's resolution. 

After twice as many scenes as players, the world ends, and with it any of the conflicts at the party.

# Lizard-Sorcerer-Spacemen Agree What to Play

 
```
A game of game creation, for a GM and two or more players.

Everyone needs a pencil, some paper and some dice.

Players each write three SKILLS their character has (eg: Safe-cracking, Charioteering, Laser Guns) on a piece of paper.  These are all revealed simultaneously.

Each player then writes down two FACTS they want to be true of the game-world (eg: magic is illegal, everyone is a dog). These are also revealed simultaneously.

The GM then writes down six FACTS about the game-world in order to enrich and reconcile the players' FACTS and SKILLS  (eg: rocket-chariots with laser cannons).  Two are kept hidden, four are revealed.  

On another sheet, the GM displays the session's primary, secondary and tertiary OBJECTIVES.

Players should then go around and introduce their characters, what role they play in this (probably eclectic) world, and why they want to complete the OBJECTIVES.

Roleplay striving to complete the OBJECTIVES.  Actions with a chance of failure are rolled against a GM set threshold, accounting for SKILLS and good roleplay.

During play, each player may establish one additional FACT or gain one additional SKILL.

Afterwards, discuss the setting you all built, and whether you want to play in it again.

# Words Over the Airwaves
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Gameplay could potentially induce anxiety. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Dice are six-sided, rolled secretly. GMless.

== Setup ==

Each player roleplays an isolated scientist studying an inhospitable planet. They can't reach each other physically, just by satellite radio.

As a group, describe and draw out the planet and each scientist's base, including equipment and environs.

Then, a random player rolls one die for a prompt:

 1 = Base equipment failure
 2 = Imminent hazard
 3 = Pest infestation
 4 = Mysterious issues
 5 = Serious illness
 6 = Natural disaster

...invents from that their scientist's emergency, announces a timescale (example: 6:1 gametime:realtime), and alerts the others in-character.

== Play ==

During play, only interact through in-character text (group chat, social media, email, whatever). Do not announce your temporary AFKs.

Characters discuss the situation and may attempt tasks thus:

- Estimate difficulty:
 0 = trivial (no roll)
 3 = normal
 6 = risky
 9 = only theoretically possible

- Roll two dice. Succeed if either meets or exceeds difficulty.

- If dice were equal, communications interruption: roll and add for realtime minutes player must stay silent before reporting what happened.

Characters may attempt tasks to assist upcoming tasks. (Example: "I'll build a copy and test-run their machine here.") Each success lowers the final difficulty by three.

End when the emergency is resolved, however it resolves.

# Two Hearts with One Face
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: doppelgangers, memory loss/recovery, possible gaslighting !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Take a deck, shuffle it, place it between you two. Gather tokens to represent your memories, your right to live.

One of you is a doppelganger. One of you is real. You can't remember who is who. Why?

Create three things: 
+ the identity you fight for
+ who you love most
+ what happens if the doppelganger is undiscovered

Spread the cards, draw one. Share a memory of:

CLUBS: Passion, mistakes well made.
SPADES: Violence, lies well received.
HEARTS: Love, corrupted and sincere.
DIAMONDS: Treasure, intangible and deadly.

The other responds. Draw one.

CLUBS: No! What actually happened was... (Gain 2 tokens)
SPADES: No. Maybe. From a certain point of view... (Gain 1 token)
HEARTS: Yes, but! You forgot something essential...(Lose 1 token)
DIAMONDS: Yes, and as a consequence...(Lose 2 tokens).

Draw cards until someone: 
+ Reaches 6 tokens
+ Despairs and gives up
+ Falls in love with someone else

When the doppelganger is revealed, draw two cards each. Reveal from your heart: 

CLUBS: Your selfish desire
SPADES: Your haunting truth
HEARTS: Your true intentions
DIAMONDS: Your hidden weapon

What happens next? Be gracious, be kind. Forgive, and let go. Forget, if you like.

Or kill, and be done with it.

# The Stuff of Myths and Legends

 
```
-----       -----
| | | TOOLS | | |
-----       -----
- 2 people, 
- one D6,
- paper,
- pen.


-----         -----
| | | PREMISE | | |
-----         -----
You're reviving an unknown myth. 
Decide who will channel:

- A Greek Demigod
- Fate

You're recreating this demigod's prophecised last day. 
Will they succumb to Fate, or defy destiny?

Let's roll!


-----                -----
| | | THE CHARACTERS | | |
-----                -----
Starting with the demigod and alternating, decide (elaborating generously):

- What's the demigod's name?
- What are they the god of?
- What's their dream? To slay, avenge, wed, voyage?
- What omen follows them? A symbol, creature, sound, word?

Decide together if this is a story of drama, humour, or poignance.


-----          -----
| | | THE PLAN | | |
-----          -----
This is it: the prophecised day.

Demigod: write, briefly, the 6 steps to fulfil your dream.
Fate: secretly, choose a number between 1-6.


-----               -----
| | | THE EXECUTION | | |
-----               -----
Demigod: Describe how you attempt step one. How are you feeling? 
Now, roll a D6.

Fate: Is this your number?
>>If so, describe how the demigod dies here. What happens afterwards?

>>If it's one higher/lower (e.g. you chose 6, demigod rolled 1 or 5), describe the close shave. Does the omen feature?

>> Otherwise, announce "...And it was as the demigod hoped."



Repeat until all steps are complete or the demigod is felled. 
Either way, congratulations:  they're the stuff of myths and legends.

# Scry - a quick game about fate

 
```
SETUP
Requires major+minor tarot deck and 2+ players. Separate major from minor and shuffle each well, then rotate half of each 180 then shuffle well. Use tarot reading guide for meanings.

CORE
Draw two major arcana each. These anchor characters. Who they are and what they face/want. Lay one minor arcana face down before each character. These are Epilogues. Describe characters and setting, drawing cards for inspiration. Characters take turns describing their actions in pursuing their ends. When luck would affect the outcome of an action, draw a minor arcana. This is your fate. If it is upright you describe the outcome using the card's reading. If it is inverted somebody else describes the outcome using that reading. Once only you may play a card as if you drew it the other way up but it then replaces your epilogue as it was drawn. Rock paper scissors for PvP. Each player draw a card to help describe why they succeeded or failed. Play until the deck is finished. Then players take turns flipping their epilogues. Upright, you get what you want, Inverted, you don't. Use the reading to describe why your character succeeded or failed.
