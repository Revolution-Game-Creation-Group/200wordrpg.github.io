# After

 
```
The world is as old as time, it rests in an ancient slumber. Iron and steel creeps from its tombs, to haunt the green world above. Ancient wonders waiting to be found, as miasmas sweep the land. Adventures arise to tempt fate, one last time.

Decide on a GM

Describe your wildly adventurer, give them two traits, one good, one bad. Design them a key item,this is a contraption to help them in this broken world.

Each player chooses 3 skills, if the player fails 5 times attempting the skill, they get the skilled action free and always succeed.

Players get 5 cards from a 52 card deck and place them face down on the table. 
Draw from this stack to Spend or Lose a card, place Gained cards on the bottom. Used cards go into the draw pile, center on the table, which is shuffled each round.

To resolve, spend a card, if the players card number (King12,...,Ace1) is higher than the next draw pile card they succeed. Discard Both.

Anytime Adventures:
>Spend to resolve
>Lose when harmed

During Adventures Turns:
>Move
>Spend to acquire
>Give a card to a Player
>Draw 2

Introduction
------------
  Pull off heists and get the most cash!


First Game
----------
  Characters are created as newbies. 

  The first heist is robbing a convenience store. Shares are $200. 


Setup
-----
  Newbies get double the share value for their bidding cash, Pros get triple, and the Ringleader get quadruple. 

  Each player proposes a problem. Each of these problems are marked down in whatever order the group decides.  


Play
----
  Problems are resolved one at a time. First, players with incapacitated PCs each add a complication, then the remaining players agree how their PCs will resolve the problem. After this, each player declares a possible outcome to the problem. 

  Each player bids by secretly writing down their desired outcome and their bid. All bids are revealed at once. The outcome that wins the bid goes into effect, and all bids are subtracted players cash. Ties are broken by additional bids. 

  Begging, bribing, and backstabbing, other players is encouraged!


Advancement
-----------
  If the PC survived they become a Pro. The PC that survived with the most bidding cash left over from the heist becomes the Ringleader. Otherwise the player must make a Newbie. 

  Finally the Ringleader chooses the next heist target and the new value of shares.

# Until the Spell is Broken

 
```
Your characters were magically cursed. Who or what was responsible? Was it the same for all of you? 

Roll d6s or choose. Consider what your curse says about you. Who are you? What should you learn? Have you accepted it, or do you want to break it? How does it affect your life? Make it as funny or dramatic as you like, but not too real: other people's lived experiences aren't for your entertainment.

What
1 - You become non-human
2 - You're still human, but something's weird
3 - A tether to something/someone/somewhere
4 - Separation from something/someone/somewhere
5 - Something happens to/around you
6 - Something doesn't/won't happen

When
1 - Periodically
2 - Certain physical/emotional states
3 - Gradually
4 - Always
5 - Someone else decides
6 - You try to talk about it

What you need to be free
1 - Love
2 - Atonement
3 - Vengeance
4 - A recipient
5 - Time
6 - An epiphany

Meet everyone else. Talk to and support each other. Confront whoever or whatever did this to you, if you want. Help each other break free, or make it easier to live with this.

# I'm Missing You (Riccardo Cocciante)
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Suicide , Abusing Relationships. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Start a music album, possibly a songwriter's.

Describe your Character with; a Name, one Relation to each other Character, a personal problem, an Aspiration.

The most tired player is the first Turn Player. Starts describing their Aspiration.
If another player LIKES what's hearing, he interrupts narrating the Turn Player's problem by their character POW. Mark that player's Problem.

The TP can now;
Renounce telling and pass turn (mark TP's Aspiration).
Negate the problem (mark the interrupter Name) and keep narrating until another player's interruption.
Ignore the interruption calling the Relation (TP mark their Relation toward that character).
If the TP ends their narration, turns pass to the right. If no interruption happened, TP marks own name x2, other players: mark relation toward TP.

When the album ends, in order:
every aspect of a Character is marked => character suicides.

two players have their respective relationship marked:
one such player mark their Aspiration or Name.
OR both player deletes their Relation.

2 marks on Aspiration => delete Aspiration.

2 marks on Name: => Mark Aspiration or one Relation. 

All players can now delete one mark from their character. Restart the album, narration continues. No Aspiration => Narrate lack of Aspiration.

Game ends at  first suicide.

# "The Worm"

 
```
This is it, the culmination of years of research in "anthropological study of 20th century dance", and finally, you and you alone have scoured the fossil record, remaining written documentation, fragments of "YouTube" videos and have finally discovered the true form of an ancient dance known as simply "The Worm".

Except, somehow, other scholars landed on the same subject matter and the damned conference has arranged a live peer review. Only one of you can go on to wow the scientific world with your transformational discovery.

Oldest player goes first.

i. Stand in front of the other players. They should be seated, with notebooks, and stern looks.

ii. Describe in detail how you came to this discovery. The research you did and how you placed each piece into the larger puzzle. Use jargon to convince them you know what you are talking about.

iii. Demonstrate "The Worm" as your reconstruction supposes it must be. It's ok to be stiff or without rhythm, you're an academic.

iv. The other players will write down review scores for "Supporting Evidence", "Compelling Case", "Convincing Demonstration"

When everyone has presented, the best reviewed presentation wins. As best you know, that dance is "The Worm".
