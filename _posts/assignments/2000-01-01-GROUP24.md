# The Heffalumps Graveyard

 
```
You play characters near the end of childhood, whose spirits journey through the land of dreams accompanying your corporeal toy companion to its final resting place in the fabled Heffalumps Graveyard, while avoiding the clutches of the villainous China Doll, the spare-part pirate. 

Gain access to the graveyard by getting past the guardian, a giant black dog, Mr Sausages. He talks with a refined accent and only lets the worthiest toys in. Lay your toy to rest & mature, or refuse and stay young forever.

Each player describes a treasured toy and names it. The group agrees which two skills the toy confers. For example:

Teddy: Grapple, forage
Action man: eagle eyes, opposable thumbs
Evil Kneivel: drive, jump
Robot: Logic, strength
My Little Pony: ride, kick
Dolly: etiquette, charm
Stretch Armstrong: reach, resist wounds

For any challenge the players roll 1D6 and an additional 1D6 for each applicable skill. Use the best roll as the result
Fail: 1 - 3
Success: 4 - 6

Sample encounters:
===========================
Buckaroo's rodeo challenge
Kerplunk - the marble tsunami
The snakes and the ladders
Sand pit dunes
Plastic dinosaur stampede
Beanie baby jungle
Hungry hungry Hippos
Meccanno bridge
Tamagotchi menagerie with  transformer zookeeper
Skeletors Bouncy Castle

# Line

 
```
An absurdist live-action game for 5 players based on the play, Line by Israel Horovitz.

BIG IDEAS:
-Characters stand in a line vying to be first despite conflicting understandings of what the line is for
-Every character's top priority is to be at the front of the line
-Players stay in character and act according to their motivation
-The game ends when everyone is at the front
-Play should last 15 minutes at most

PREPARING TO PLAY:
-Mark the ground where the line begins with visible tape.

CHARACTER CREATION:
Players gather in a circle and take turns answering the following aloud:
-What is your name?
-Why is it important that you are at the front?
-What don't you like about the character to your left?

Each player rolls 1d5 (or 1d4 + Id2 [scored 1 or 0]) on the following table (each player's should be different):

Line Strategy: This is how you plan to get to the front...
1. Starts at the front of the line (you got there early)
2. Fast Talking and Confusing
3. Sex Appeal
4. Bullying
5. Opportunist

PLAY:
Enter play in ascending order according to rolls (1 starts in play).

# Homunculi - Tiny Servants of Evil

 
```
You are homunculi, tiny human facsimiles possessed by dead spirits. You carry out evil deeds of dark magic for your master. You have some faint memories of being human.

Shuffle a pack of cards and draw five each. These represent your memories.

Oldest player starts.

Turn sequence:
- Reveal the top card of the deck. This is the task. 
- Going clockwise players reveal a memory, in suit if possible.
  All memories in suit: highest performs the task. 
  Non-suit memories: lowest non-suit performs the task.
- Resolution:
  Memory higher than task: A good memory, reinforced (place task under memory). While reinforced it cannot be lost. 
  Memory equal or lower: A bad memory, discard it.
  Memory not in suit: A bad memory, discard it and choose:
    - Discard a reinforcement or another memory
    or
    - Give a reinforced memory to another homunculus (explain why it was theirs all along)
- Describe the task and the memories.
- Put discards in pile for reshuffle.
- Active player draws another task to start the next turn.

Game ends when either:
One homunculus reinforces all remaining memories: they break free and escape from the master.
One homunculus loses all their memories: they become a mindless servant of evil, destroying the others.
