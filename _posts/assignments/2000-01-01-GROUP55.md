# Monsters in the Night

 
```
You make camp for the night. 
The only light to see by is the fire.  
Something stirs in the forest...

GM sets the scene, mood, and describes any monster(s) the players will face.

Roll for success: Roll 1d6 to determine any outcome. 
A 4 or higher is a success. 

Monster(s) have HP equal to the total HP of all players at the table.

Split HP evenly if using more than 1 monster.

Monsters deal 1d6 damage for all attacks.

Characters: All characters begin with 12 HP, basic equipment for adventuring, and one weapon.

All weapons and effects deal 1d6 damage, spells and/or abilities may increase this.

Each player can create 3 special moves (or spells). The players and the Gm will determine damage and/or any effects.

Special abilities (or spells) can only be used 3 times/encounter. (GM may change this number depending on power of effect desired).

The Hunter: Longbow  
Armor: take -1 point of damage

The Warrior: Longsword 
Armor: take -2 points of damage

The Priest: Mace

# If I Grow Up
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Children in peril !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
We are all children, but strangers; trapped together, facing an impending doom. Not all will survive.

For 2-5 players.

Setup a Jenga Tower in the middle of the play space.

Everyone takes a cue card and writes: 

Name:
Age:
Hopes:
Dreams:

Write nothing else for now.

This is your character; you are trapped with the others, you are not an adult.

A player goes first and asks to the left, "What do you want to be, if you grow up?" Everyone takes a turn asking to the left until all have answered.

Now go around again, each player taking a turn asking any question they wish to the left.  After they answer, the questioner pulls and places a brick from the tower.  Fill in your own character as you answer.

Keep going around, asking questions, until the tower falls.  

When it falls, everyone's character, except for the last player to have placed a brick, dies.

The survivor answers this question: "Whose dreams will you take with you into the future?"

Use the survivor to create a character in another game and strive to make that world better.

The Beginning.

# Super Dupes!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Humor, lack of seriousness !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
To make your super, you gotta give:

-a secret identity (the man/woman/attack helicopter behind the mask)

-Some powers (being God, literally or otherwise, doesn't count)

-Something to power you up in your hour of need.  That's your spinach
-Something to be your kryptonite (spinach on opposite day)
Power level (starts at 3)

Gameplay:
     When it's time to use your powers, roll [power level] d6s and assign any three to the following statements:
     [ ] I did the thing
     [ ] Nobody got hurt
     [ ] Nothing got broken
1-3s bad (player describes how) but pay 1 experience, 4-6s good.  

Got spinach? Get a reroll!  
Got? kryptonite? DM rerolls for you.
Spinach and keeping cancel each other out in their mutual emnity.

     Now if everything goes wrong, you lose a power level.  Got none? you're done.


Spending that sweet XP after session:
     1 XP- Change your superhero name... and maybe your custome while you're at it

     2 XP- Find a new spinach.

     3 XP- up that power level.

     4 XP- Find a new kryptonite.

     10 XP- actually retire.  Peace out!

# Our First Date was at the Mini-Golf Course

 
```
It's your first date. You're going mini-golfing.
Who are you? To each other? Why here?

Each of you guess who will win, don't reveal.

If your ball (choose one)...
-goes into the hole: Your date finds something endearing about you.
-hits your date's ball and ___ ends up closer to the hole... 
-their ball: you say something that your date finds charming. What is it?
-your ball: your date is offended by something you said offhand. What is it? How is it resolved?
-goes into a hazard: You overthink something small and decide it's a huge problem of yours. What is it?
-bumps an obstacle: you try to make an impression. How? Does it?

If you ___  on the winner and... 
-agreed 
-were right: What made you go on a second date, was it the right choice?
-were wrong: For some reason you never went on a second date, where did you go from there?
-disagreed 
-were wrong: You made a choice to not go on a second date. Why? How did that play out?
-were right: You wanted to go on another date, but never did. What about them made you want to go on another?

Your planet is dying. 

You are a team of researchers sent to assess if Earth can be a new home where your few remaining people could peacefully settle. Disguised as regular Earthlings, you will clandestinely collect data on this peculiar place and its inhabitants. During the game, discuss your findings and reach a conclusion.

To start, name your researcher, then select 2 descriptors to guide role-playing them:
-Optimistic
-Pessimistic
-Scientific
-Philosophical
-Anthropological
-Idealistic
-Cynical
-Pragmatic
-Other?

Create a group chat accessible to all players. Over an agreed upon timeframe (1-3 days?) talk with your fellow researchers, detailing your observations to them using text, pictures, audio, whatever. Players may use their real-world observations to guide their role-playing (don't identify real people without permission). 

During play, allow the following to emerge in conversation if/when appropriate:
-What's happening to your planet?
-How has it affected you? 
-What there can never be replicated? 
-How is Earth beautiful/intriguing? 
-How is Earth terrifying/strange? 
-What will those you love think of Earth?

To conclude, discuss:
-What you learned about Earth.
-If Earth is a suitable new home.

Collectively, write up your formal recommendation.

Afterwards, consider what you, the player, learned from your observations.

# Sustenance and Sustainability

 
```
It is the zombie apocalypse. You are vampires.

You govern a community of survivors, giving them strength and security at night.

They struggle against isolation, poverty, and violence, giving you sustenance and protection during daylight. 

Each community member must eventually and inevitably die, and toil until then. In this way, little has changed.

You struggle to survive a world where your source of life hunts itself to extinction.

They are rebuilding. Your apocalypse is now.

\/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/

Provide details for each:

Your political opponent is:
- influential or relentless.

Your flaws are:
- within or around you.
- haunting or dooming you.

Your powers are:
- dangerous or hidden.
- costly or terrifying.

You community motivations are:
- progressive or personal.
- sustainable or obsessive.

\/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/

For all vampires:
- Human blood strengthens you.
- Zombie blood zombifies you.
- Sunlight, stakes, and beheadings kill you.

\/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/  \/\/

Play:
In each scene, someone is the Storyteller. The remainder play vampires.

The Storyteller describes conflicts. The vampires describe their attempts to survive.

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the player measures their pulse in BPM (ProTip: use an app). Take the ones digit. Low numbers produce setbacks. High numbers produce opportunities.

The Storyteller begins play with: "The sun sets. An emergency meeting is called."
