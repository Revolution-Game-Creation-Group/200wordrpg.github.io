Something stirs in the forest...

# Grumpy Neighborhood

 
```
This is a game without the common Game Master where all the participants take on the role of an elderly person living in a quiet neighborhood.
All the players are neighbors and they all face the same threat: the annoying kids that keep moving in with their loud music and over-the-top shenanigans.
The game begins with the oldest member in the group stating what kind of erratic behavior the kids are conducting and sets a difficulty of 1 to 6. Then the next player (clockwise) says how he/she will kick them out, rolling a 6 sided die and succeeding if the roll meets or exceeds the difficulty. If the roll is lower, the kids remain, calling their friends and increasing the base difficulty by 1.
Once all the players have had a turn, the difficulty can't get lower than 5, since the kids will be starting their new best party of the year.
More than ever, the neighbors must work together! Each player states their part on the great plan and in the end they all roll. On a 5 or higher, they manage to kick the kids of their neighborhood, returning to their peaceful lives!

# In Love in a Movie

 
```
Players: One to four couples, and a GM
Aspects: Each person picks a pair of opposite traits, and their partner assigns them to the pair.
Scenes: The GM draws five playing cards and each couple draws four. Pick a couple to go first. Clockwise, each couple describes their scene. Once a scene, each couple or the GM can play a card and add a detail. Red cards are coincidences that promote love. Black cards hinder love. When a couple plays a card on their own scene, if the effect relates to a trait they have, they draw another card. Keep all the cards played in your scenes. After all the scenes, everyone discards their hand and starts the next scene type.
Scene Types: The three scenes are "Meet Cute," "Horrific Misunderstanding," and "Grand Gesture"
Finale: After the three scenes, add up each couple's red cards, and subtract the black cards. Couples with 0 or less points break up. The finale is a single scene with all the players at the wedding of the winning couple. If the winning couple has 0 or less points, they break up at their own wedding.

In the first room they enter trances and must defeat their inner demons defined at character creation. Between the GM and the other players each player in turn work to defeat or resolve the backstory. After each half hour slot the player may announce whether or not they have dealt with their inner demons. Play for fun, laughs, love and tears.

# Cursed Adventures

 
```
Draw a king, whose suit determines your adventurer's curse:
Heart: Heart encounters heal you for half as much.
Diamond: You take 1 damage at the beginning of every turn.
Club: Subtract 1 from every die you roll.
Spade: Your lowest die doesn't count when you attack

To start, you get 2 d6's for attacking. You start with 20 max health.

To fight: Take turns rolling your attack dice. Subtract the total from your enemies health.

Every round draw 1 card for every player in game. Decide who will take each card. These cards determine your encounters, as follows:
Heart: You meet a healer. Describe them. Heal player for card's value.
Diamond: Take the card. If the diamond cards you are holding have a combined value of 6 or greater, then you may discard them to level up. When you level up, add 10 to your max health, and take 1 more d6 attack die.
Club or Spade: You encounter an enemy with health equal to card value and d6's for attack equal to card value divided by 4, rounded up. Describe your enemy, then fight.

Everyone loses when anyone's hp reaches 0.
If you clear the whole deck, you win!
