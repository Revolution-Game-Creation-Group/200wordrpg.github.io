# I AM / WE ARE

 
```
You are clones of Subject Zero.
Clones are illegal, secret or problematic.

Together, create 6 Original Traits for Subject Zero
Your clone has 3 Original Traits. Without consulting with the other players, pick 3 Unique Traits

Setup (Each player answers)
How did you discover your nature? Who's the Most Important Person to you?

Play
R&D (the GM) sets the scene. Start with each clone's MIP. Roll dice when something is uncertain, setting stakes before each roll. After each scene, if you lost a roll, change a Trait. Change a Unique Trait to an Original Trait or vice-versa. You can use new or existing Unique Traits. The game ends when one clone has only Unique Traits or Original Traits. Each player picks an epilogue, most Original Traits first. Cross off an epilogue after it is picked.

Rolls
R&D sets difficulty X from 2-6 (average 3) and rolls Xd6. The clone rolls 1d6, +1d6 for each applicable Trait. Helping players can add 1d6 for each matching Trait. Total the two highest dice. On ties, R&D wins, and a twist occurs (betrayal, unexpected ally, a new clone, etc.).

Epilogues

Trapped
New Legacy

# Make it as you go RPG

 
```
Determine turn order randomly.
Each turn, each player adds a setting element and a game mechanic.
Other players can expand on prior additions, but can't contradict or replace them.
Repeat until you're all satisfied.
Choose gamemaster (GM), random GM, or no GM.
Play the game.

Example:

Turn 1
Player A: Scifi game with 3d6 resolution mechanic, degrees of success.
Player B: Also a romance game. Classes are Mysterious Stranger, Smooth Criminal, Action Star, and The Professional.
Player C: The Earth Federation has been ravaged by the Space Dandelions, the dandy feline weed-people. Characters get +1 for actions relating to their class.

Turn 2
Player A: The Space Dandelions don't want to destroy humanity, but to integrate them into the Dandy Union. Players get tokens for successfully befriending / romancing NPCs which are used to give them benefits on other rolls.
Player B: The Dandy Union is fighting a secret war against a more powerful Earth Federation from across the multiverse. Each player gets a special ability specific to social conflict.
Player C: The campaign takes place on Mars. The special abilities must specifically affect outcomes, not provide benefits to rolls.

Let's game!

# Wordhunger

 
```
This is a game for two people-myself, and a partner. It should never be played with an empty meal, such as when my partner is a mirror or a photograph.
We'll sit together, you and I, and lock our aching hands together. You can begin. Stare silently into my eyes for as long as you can bear, until words begin to come crawling out of your mouth. Describe me, fully, as what you see before you. You're not here to bolster my ego, or to dig deep against my insecurities. I am your teleprompter. Your tongue shapes me.
Describe my jawline, jutting forward. Describe my skin, stubble bursting. Describe my off-white teeth, my thin gums, my tired hair. Describe my eyes as I listen to you say these words. Describe my tears, describe my smile, describe how I look when I try to look away. Call me what you want. See me. 
With your teeth and lips and alveolar ridge and dagger tongue, tear against my soft skin.
Once you have finished, and you are full of me, I can do the same for you, and we can feast together on what remains.

# Why Does Someone Always Die at Dinner?

 
```
All Players play a character at a dinner party where someone is murdered.  Over the course of the night they must learn about each other, hunt for clues, and find out who's the murderer by rolling the dice and telling a cooperative story in phases.  This is a role-play and story-telling centric game.
Phase 1: The Introduction:
Each player rolls a d6.  The number indicates the number of pieces of personal information about their character they must include in the conversation as the party-goers meet each other.  
Phase 2: The Murder:
The players find the body and search for clues to what happened.  Each player rolls a d6.  The number determines how many clues each player adds to the story.  Players bring forward their clues to the group in character.
Phase 3: The Intrigue:
Each player rolls a d6.  The number rolled determines how many additions or rebuttals they are allowed to make related to the clues found in phase 2.
Phase 4: The Parlor:
All players act out the parlor scene to decide who the murderer is based on the clues, information, and rebuttals brought forward in the first 3 phases.  Dramatic finger pointing and gasping is encouraged.

# Codeck

 
```
Codeck is a GM-less TTRPG inspired by the world's most popular tactical espionage action video game series. Players take on the roles of a solo operative on a dangerous infiltration mission and their support team who are in radio contact. All roleplay is done via radio conversations.

> Any amount of mission time may elapse between calls.

== Prompts ==
> Hearts: emotional melodrama.
> Diamonds: the villains' plot.
> Clubs: discuss an obstacle facing the operative.
> Spades: elaborate historical context.
> A-2: make the call on a private frequency.
> 3-5: reveal a secret.
> 6-7: make an analogy to popular culture or philosophy.

# In the olden times..

 
```
Players guide a shepherd as they herd their flock through the overgrown ruins of a once great city, the former heart of a long fallen empire.

One at a time the players pick a location the herd is grazing through and the shepherd contemplates. 

The current player begins the contemplation by saying "In the olden times they used to.." and the player shares a long passed rumor, memory or tale of the old empire and their customs. Did they sell fellow men for a few scraps of gold? Did they send inexhaustible armies beyond the horizon? Do the ruins provoke awe, bemusement, fear?

The current player ends their tale by saying ".. but not anymore." The herd moves on and the next player picks a location to ruminate over. Once every player has shared two tales, the day draws to an end and the flock leaves the city.

For locations select attractions from a tourist map of any major city.

# Hey, this song reminds me of you

 
```
A two-player experience about listening to music together.

to set up, each player shares one song to the other, then they narrate who their character is based on your songs. both songs are added to a new playlist.

to start, player-A shares a song to player-B and says "hey this song reminds me of you"

player-B then leads a scene inspired by the song.

a scene needs to be about a time the two characters listened to this song together, sharing some kind of vulnerability like listening to something in a car or listening on a call late at night or in a crowded room with shared earbuds. have your characters converse and interact.

at the end of every scene, both players vote at the same time to add the song to the playlist

if both say no: it does not get added.
if there's a disagreement: naysayer removes a song.
if both say yes: add the song.

now player-B shares a song to player-A and player-A leads a scene. scenes can take place hours, days, or even years after the previous scene.

if you feel as though their story is told, give the playlist a name.
