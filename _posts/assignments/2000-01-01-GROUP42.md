# I AM / WE ARE

 
```
You are clones of Subject Zero.
Clones are illegal, secret or problematic.

Together, create 6 Original Traits for Subject Zero
Your clone has 3 Original Traits. Without consulting with the other players, pick 3 Unique Traits

Setup (Each player answers)
How did you discover your nature? Who's the Most Important Person to you?

Play
R&D (the GM) sets the scene. Start with each clone's MIP. Roll dice when something is uncertain, setting stakes before each roll. After each scene, if you lost a roll, change a Trait. Change a Unique Trait to an Original Trait or vice-versa. You can use new or existing Unique Traits. The game ends when one clone has only Unique Traits or Original Traits. Each player picks an epilogue, most Original Traits first. Cross off an epilogue after it is picked.

Rolls
R&D sets difficulty X from 2-6 (average 3) and rolls Xd6. The clone rolls 1d6, +1d6 for each applicable Trait. Helping players can add 1d6 for each matching Trait. Total the two highest dice. On ties, R&D wins, and a twist occurs (betrayal, unexpected ally, a new clone, etc.).

# Life is Hard
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
In Life is Hard, you must go about a totally normal day and survive. Goals are simple: Getting to class on time, for example Everyone is encouraged to play a character rather than relying on a single GM/DM, as all players are expected to tell the story together. 

Best done in round-table fashion, taking turns to take actions, everyone should narrate the person on their right, and once their portion of the action is complete, control passes to the person who just narrated.

To take an action, players roll a 20 sided dice, on a 15 plus, you succeed without issue, on a 14 or lower, something terrible happens. Attacked by savage squirrels while walking through the park, having to fight off the janitorial staff at school who all turned into zombies suddenly, use your imagination! Players must describe how they get out of these terrible happenings. Actions should be clear and concise, IE "Take a shortcut through the park". 

All players start with 0 damage marked, and take 1 damage from each terrible happening. Once they hit 5 damage, they're dead!

Game ends when all players or dead, or someone reaches the end of their daily routine.

You are a GALACTIC/GOTHIC BOUNTY HUNTER.
This is your LAST MISSION, but you know only this:
You must stop FULIGIN STAR.
And you're willing to SACRIFICE EVERYTHING.

On results you HAVE NOT YET rolled, SACRIFICE a power:
1: POWER SHELL
2: POWER BOOST
3: POWER MORPH
4: POWER SIGHT
5: POWER BEAM
6: POWER SWORD

Then, consider these questions and RECORD your STAR LOG:
> How was your sacrifice forced, and by whom?
> How did you track your target, and to where?
> What made the sacrifice worth it?
> What has driven you to stop FULIGIN STAR?

>>> On your final SACRIFICE, you stop FULIGIN STAR.
>>> How will you be REMEMBERED FOREVER?

Stop FULIGIN STAR.
Be REMEMBERED FOREVER.

# Breadcrumbs

 
```
Each player is an investigator. Start only with faint description of crime or perpetrator.

Allocate 4, 6, 8, 10 between soldier, investigator, scientist and negotiator traits. Lower is better.

Active player alternates and frames and resolves his scene. Take your time, let other players take part as NPC's and help you tell story. Each scene ends with roll. Choose trait that suits best and roll 2d6.

If you rolled equal or higher to chosen trait, add its value to success pool and describe how you moved the investigation forward.

If you ever collect 25 points per player, investigators win. Tell epilogue together.

If you rolled less, take hit or obstruct investigation.

To take hit, increase trait you just used by 3 and describe how you were irreversibly damaged. If you cannot (because it will be more than 12), you can leave story instead. Tell your epilogue how you died or became crazy...

Alternatively you can obstruct investigation. Play a flashback scene from the perpetrator's point of view. Prepare some trap to investigators. From now everyone will get -1 to their rolls. If this is ever done five times, perpetrator wins. Describe epilogue what happened, everyone should take part.

# Pool Pirates

 
```
Requires: 1 body of water, 3 pool noodles in black (Pirate), blue (Navy) & yellow (Merchant)
Collectively decide on 3 locations in the water for ports and 3 players to be captains

Each captain takes a noodle and other players join a crew 
Players may leave ships at any port and then may join any ship that travels to that port

The crew of the Merchant ship gets a point by traveling from one port to another
The crew of the Pirate ship gets a point for battling merchants
The crew of the Navy ship gets two points for winning battles against pirates


Battle
If ships meet at sea the captains will declare why they are the best captain and all players in each ship pick a side.  The captain with the most players on their side gets 3 points.  


Mutiny
If the crew mutinies the captain must swim to a port and a new captain is elected.  If more than half of a crew agrees they can mutiny


End
The game ends when it feels right.  Players with 20+ points win, players with < 20 points wasted their life.

# Rise and Fall of Civilisations

 
```
In this game, three players narrate the rise and fall of a civilisation.

Phase 1 - Creation:

Each player in turn defines one starting characteristic of their initial tribe: physical environment (climate, presence of resources...), origin story (real or mythological) and relation to others (isolated, surrounded by enemies...).


Phase 2 - Rise:

This phase lasts up to 10 rounds, with three roles rotating each round, describing the following:
	1) A major event affecting the whole civilisation (plague, invasion, scientific discovery...)
	2) The immediate reaction and impact from this event by the population
	3) The slow aftermath over the following century, as the civilisation adapts

Each round covers a 100 years in total, and must take into account (and possibly build on) the consequences of all previous rounds. Players are free to discuss the evolution of society and collective psychology in as much depth as they may find interesting.


Phase 3 - Fall:

If the civilisation is still standing at this point, each player then must describe a way in which it brings about its own downfall. All three scenarios then happen at once in an era-ending moment; it is up to the players to decide what legacy if any may be left behind.

# All You Can Eat
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: zombies !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are a zombie with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The last humans are holed up nearby. What will you do to eat them?

Required Materials:

1d6

Pen and paper

Buffet Restaurant(or similar source of food)

Setup:

Players create zombie characters by allocating 6 points between two traits, "Dexterity"(the ability to perform tasks beyond shuffling aimlessly) and "Durability"(how many body parts a zombie can lose). After allocating stats, players should grab a plate of as much food as they want and play begins.

Play:

The goal of the zombies is to completely devour the last human stronghold. The GM describes challenges from the environment and the human survivors preventing this. Challenges are rated 1(trivial)-10(impossible). Players describe which trait they use to overcome it and roll the d6. If higher, they may narrate the successful outcome. If lower, they lose a point in that trait and the GM narrates. Players may eat food to add +1 to the roll per bite. Should either trait fall below zero, that zombie is eliminated and the player may create a new one.

Play continues until the humans are eaten or the players themselves are full.
