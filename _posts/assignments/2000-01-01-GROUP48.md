# The Dragon is Dead

 
```
With the tyrant vanquished, the people can rebuild, but years of conflict have reduced the kingdom to ruin.

Pick a profession. You are commonfolk, not adventurers - blacksmiths, farmers, shopkeepers. You have a shared pool of resources, one per player.

Each player writes down a problem: widespread famine, flooded farmland, rampant crime, etc. Shuffle them and, without looking, write ascending numbers on their backs starting with 1. This is each problem's severity.

Flip over any one of the problems. Roll the die and add the severity; this is the difficulty to solve the problem.

All players roll. If one of the players has a relevant skill they want to use, add +1 to their roll. That player becomes exhausted and cannot roll for the next problem. Each player that rolls a 1 adds 1 to the group's resource pool.

Compare the highest roll to the difficulty; if it's higher, the problem is solved. If it's lower, the group can choose to spend resources to reach the difficulty, solving it.

You win the game if the total severity of the problems you solved is greater than those left unsolved.

If you fail, the dragon returns.

# Abandon

```
This game is about the tension of partying with intentions, set inside a nightclub. 

Each player sets a goal they want to achieve. The GM adjudicates.
 
Each character has a list of 10 adjectives, corresponding to their mood: 
 
1. Joyful 
2. Confident 
3. _____ 
4. _____ 
5. _____ 
6. _____
7. Insecure 
8. Intoxicated 
9. Resentful 
10. Dejected
 
Blanks are custom.
 
To resolve a challenge or move a scene a player may either: 
-roll a d10 to determine a mood. 
-choose a mood, and burn it. 

The player and GM then explains how their character's mood is used to impact events.

A burned mood may not be used again. If rolled, the result takes +1. 
 
At any time, a player may offer a mood to another, either traded or gifted. If accepted, the mood is removed, written secretly on a piece of paper, and passed over face-down. This replaces an entry on the recipient's list, their choice.

Recipients may either:
-turn it over, which triggers it and burns it.
-leave it until a roll reveals it. 

Once a mood is revealed, players should explain how their characters' interactions determine the outcome.  
 
Play continues until a player has achieved their objective, or is burnt out.

# Free Range

 
```
Greetings, fellow Fumoggulians! We hope you had a great time coming out of stasis. Our next destination, Earth, has just been reached. As on previous planets, we will equip you with the necessary morphological changes. Two arms, what a hoot! Remember, eyes are tricky, so please don't forget to put on your shades.

Our group will be shuttled to a large trade building, where the Earthlings purchase their goods. Each traveller will be provided with a special Earth device, a primitive mobile computing unit, that can also make sensory recording. Don't hesitate to use them, it's fun! Please also be reminded of our policy to not directly engage with lifeforms beyond small talk. When approached, we recommend showing your "teeth" in the upper frontal orifice a bit and using one of the following sentences provided by the installed xenotranslator: 

"Hey, nice!" 
"Cool day?"
"Wow..."
"That's great."

After a set period of 30 Earth minutes we will meet again in front of the trade building, where a camouflaged shuttle will pick us up. We will finish the trip by sharing our recordings and voting for the most hilarious one. The winner gets an Earthling hat!

# Audio Commentary

 
```
1-3 players

Make a warm cup of tea and light a candle in front of the television. Put some soft pillows and a blanket around yourself. Eat some chocolate.

Pick a random movie. Watch it on low volume.

You each choose to play as a director or leading actor and comments the movie as if you were recording an audio commentary. Talk about a randomly generated subject for each new scene.

DIRECTOR
1. Symbolics
2. The actors
3. Camera angles
4. Reviews
5. Connections to other scenes
6. CGI

ACTOR (when in the scene)
1. Your preparations
2. What the character is feeling
3. What you, the actor, felt
4. The set
5. This went wrong
6. The other actors


If your actor isn't in the scene you can talk about:

1. Sound
2. Lights
3. Clothes
4. Make up
5. Music
6. The script

THEME
Your audio commentary has a theme. What is it?

- Humour
- Education
- Reviewing a classic
- Political incentive
- Laid back

Can you find another theme?

Record your audio commentary and make it public. Name it "RPG Audio Commentary + [Movie] + [Your names]. Make it easy for people to synchronize the audio with the movie.

Have fun!

# Awakened

 
```
The earth is dying. The oceans are boiling. Life is out of options. 

And so, you have awakened.

All of you will, as a group or in turn, describe what you are. You need not be the same.

Then you will describe why and how you will save the planet. How do you come together as one?

You will set out tasks, goals, challenges. What must you overcome?

As you tell this story, and embody your awakened, there will be times when it's unclear whether or not you can do something. In those moments, you'll draw one card from a single, shuffled deck. 
 
Ace: No, and / You don't do it, and something even worse happens.
2-4: No, but / You don't do it, but somehow you're helped forward
5-8: Yes, but / You do it, but you're worse for wear
9-Jack: You do it.
Queen, King. Yes, and / It goes even better than you'd imagined.

Odds are better when you work together. If working together on an action, you each draw a card, and the highest determines the result above.

Your story ends when the planet is saved, or when all is lost.
