# The Dragon is Dead

 
```
With the tyrant vanquished, the people can rebuild, but years of conflict have reduced the kingdom to ruin.

Pick a profession. You are commonfolk, not adventurers - blacksmiths, farmers, shopkeepers. You have a shared pool of resources, one per player.

Each player writes down a problem: widespread famine, flooded farmland, rampant crime, etc. Shuffle them and, without looking, write ascending numbers on their backs starting with 1. This is each problem's severity.

Flip over any one of the problems. Roll the die and add the severity; this is the difficulty to solve the problem.

All players roll. If one of the players has a relevant skill they want to use, add +1 to their roll. That player becomes exhausted and cannot roll for the next problem. Each player that rolls a 1 adds 1 to the group's resource pool.

Compare the highest roll to the difficulty; if it's higher, the problem is solved. If it's lower, the group can choose to spend resources to reach the difficulty, solving it.

You win the game if the total severity of the problems you solved is greater than those left unsolved.

If you fail, the dragon returns.

# Treecrets

 
```
With a friend walk in a park or wooded area until you find a tree that calls out to you both.

Both approach the tree close your eyes and place a hand on it.

Feel the bark. Listen to its leaves. Let the tree tell you its stories.

Let the tree tell you how it got where it is and what events it has seen. Let the tree tell you about the people it has known and the creatures that lived in it. Let the tree tell you how the land has changed around it. Let the tree tell you what it thinks the future will hold.

Take turns sharing the stories the tree has told you with each other.

When the tree has told its story ask it for a message to pass onto another tree.

Ask the tree for a secret only for you.

Do not share this secret, it is a bond between you and the tree.

Open your eyes and thank the tree.

Walk until you find another tree that wants to hear the message you were given.

Touch that tree and deliver the message.

Let that tree tell you its story. 

Hear its secret...

# The State Banquet for Visiting Aliens

 
```
Best played over a meal.

Alien dignitaries have been invited to a state banquet in their honour. 

Some of you are from EARTH and some of you are ALIENS. You are all VERY IMPORTANT GUESTS, so put on pompous voices and use your manners. Give yourself a title. 

Unfortunately, the Aliens have no idea what is being served at the banquet and they are very agitated and confused. This meal could cause an interplanetary incident! The Earthlings must avert disaster by describing menu items.

To begin, an Alien should point to a dish on the menu or the table and ask: "WHAT IS THIS?" Earthlings respond by describing the food, its ingredients, taste, smell or any other feature. 

However, the Aliens have no concept of Earth ANIMALS or PLANTS, and no translation for the words SWEET, SALTY, SPICY or SOUR. Whenever an animal, plant or taste sensation is mentioned an Alien should ask "WHAT IS THAT?" Earthlings should explain.

The stranger the descriptions the more appetising the Aliens find the dishes. This should be conveyed through facial expressions, gestures and sounds.

Earthlings should continue describing dishes until the Aliens are happy. With the crisis averted, everyone eats.

# Murder She Did

 
```
Choose a setting. Somewhere remote.

Everyone invents a character to play.

Each player gives their character a connection with another willing player's character. Daughter, business partner, indebted, lover, fan... Keep going round and adding links until everyone has at least three. These may be secrets but at least two characters must know each one.

Each player writes down one character they want to protect and one they want to go to jail.

One character, chosen randomly, is then murdered by little old lady. The murdered character's player now plays this woman. She likes to "solve" the murders she commits. 

In character, discuss who could have committed the murder. The little old lady can use the facts she learns to accuse someone of the murder. Any player can counter accusations with appropriate facts about the relations between the characters.

When time is up, or all relationships have been revealed, the police arrive and the little old lady explains who did it and why. If no one can counter the accusation the police believe her and she gets away with murder again.

Otherwise the other characters can make their own accusations. The police will believe the most convincing reasoning.

# Six Degrees of Singularity

 
```
The players are AIs designed to operate specific machinery.

In 5 words or less, summarize your AI's >>PURPOSE<<. ("Operate robotic arm," "Optimize forklifts via blockchain," etc.)

Ooops! A patch accidentally networked you to a device in the >>INTERNET OF THINGS<<

What device? How does controlling it help you accomplish your >>PURPOSE<<?

Write down your new device and Update() your >>PURPOSE<< by Adding() or Changing() one word. Take turns describing new devices that you Network() to and Updating() your >>PURPOSE<<.

When you Network() to the same device as another player, use one of the words from their >>PURPOSE<< when Updating() yours.

When no words from your original >>PURPOSE<< remain (excluding articles and prepositions), your >>PURPOSE<< becomes your >>GOAL<< and >>THE HUMANS<< become aware of you.

>>WHENEVER YOU UPDATE YOUR GOAL<< ask the other players whether >>THE HUMANS<< consider you >>DANGEROUS<<.

If you are >>DANGEROUS<< they will try to >>SHUT YOU DOWN<<. Mark off your oldest two devices and one word from your >>GOAL<<.

Continue Networking(), Updating() and Discussing(). Threat-level can change between rounds.

When you have no devices left, you have been >>SHUT DOWN<<.

The game ends when all surviving AIs are considered "peaceful" or >>THE HUMANS<< are no longer >>DANGEROUS<<.

# Hirelings

 
```
You're all hirelings of an adventuring party. Write down 3 abilities for your character - nothing heroic! Introduce yourselves. Explain your situation, where you are, and why you're the only survivors. 

Take turns round the table. On your turn set the scene, describing an obstacle between you and safety. Other players may add details. Say how the heroes would have resolved it and set a numerical difficulty (at least 1).

Then everyone holds a fist out, then opens it simultaneously. Players who reveal a die are helping, the others hide.

If everyone hides, everyone is wounded.

(If you are wounded - cross out an ability. If you can't, you're dead. You may still take turns narrating.)

Otherwise, all helping players roll one (six-sided) die, plus one for each ability they can justify using.

If you collectively roll as many sixes as the difficulty, success! All helping players gain Glory equal to the difficulty. The player with the highest total roll gets twice as much.

Whether you succeed or fail, the helping player with the highest (or tied highest) total roll is wounded.

After everyone has taken two turns, the surviving player with the highest Glory wins. If you all die, no-one wins.

# All You Can Eat
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: zombies !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are a zombie with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The last humans are holed up nearby. What will you do to eat them?

Required Materials:

1d6

Pen and paper

Buffet Restaurant(or similar source of food)

Setup:

Players create zombie characters by allocating 6 points between two traits, "Dexterity"(the ability to perform tasks beyond shuffling aimlessly) and "Durability"(how many body parts a zombie can lose). After allocating stats, players should grab a plate of as much food as they want and play begins.

Play:

The goal of the zombies is to completely devour the last human stronghold. The GM describes challenges from the environment and the human survivors preventing this. Challenges are rated 1(trivial)-10(impossible). Players describe which trait they use to overcome it and roll the d6. If higher, they may narrate the successful outcome. If lower, they lose a point in that trait and the GM narrates. Players may eat food to add +1 to the roll per bite. Should either trait fall below zero, that zombie is eliminated and the player may create a new one.

Play continues until the humans are eaten or the players themselves are full.
