# Let's Get Paid
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Crime !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are criminals, ready to take a big score. Roll 1d6:
1. Jewelry store
2. Bank
3. Home robbery
4. Blackmail
5. Art theft
6. Assassination

Core Mechanic
You will need d6 of two different colors; designate one color as Cool, and the other as Heat. Each PC starts with one die of each color. Whenever you attempt something, the GM will give a difficulty, 2-6, and you will roll all of your Cool and Heat dice. If any Cool dice are equal to or above the difficulty, you succeed. If any Heat are below, there is a complication. Choose your complication:
-Something bad happens to you, and +1 to your Heat dice
-Something less bad happens to everyone, +1 to Threat Meter
PCs can get more Cool dice by making progress, gathering useful items, or generally being great criminals (GM's discretion). 

Threat Meter
The Threat Meter has 6 segments, and tracks the amount of heat on the heist. Every segment filled should complicate the heist for all of the players (more guards, increased security). If the Threat Meter ever fills up, the cops have shut down the heist, get out of there!

# Great Lord Vacoom

 
```
You all dogs and one of you is worst nightmare, Great Lord Vahcoom, giant wind god capable of producing immense loud noise and sucks up everything in path. Great lord wrecks havoc in domain RUFFly once a week and seems to take control of  human master until satisfied.

Before game begins, dogs will write down their most prized possession(do not actually need to possess it and it should be something a dog would prize) choose 20 words and write them down. 

On your turn, another player start stopwatch and you begin praising great lord, talk about why your possession is more important and why everyone else's is less important, and tell tale from past life only using the 20 words. Say stop when you're done.

 If speech lasted more than 2 minutes or less than 1 minute, 30 seconds or did not meet requirements, great lord kills you. If great lord likes praise, you get extra life. If players including great lord unanimously agree that your argument or tale not good, subtract 1 extra life(cannot kill you). 

Free words: Me, You, name of your possession

Be last dog to survive. 

Great lord always win.

Praise great lord.

# Descent to the Golden City (Necropolis)

 
```
A group of adventurers are descending to the golden city foretold by a dying star.

Needed:

Deck of cards
1d6
Wits
Friends

One person starts being the hero, everyone else isn't the hero. After a round, the next person becomes the hero and so forth. Discuss Your adventures and why you're looking for the Golden City.

Each player draws 2 cards face down

Players may either draw a card, flip one over or pass.

Hearts: Sword
Clubs: A club
Spades: Shovel
Diamonds: Jewels

Every turn hero may investigate ruins, GM rolls d6 and takes that many cards from deck. The last card is flipped and if it is the same suite as a card you flipped over, you get that card. Shuffle all other flipped cards back into the deck.

If GM flips over a royal, an enemy appears

Jack: Zombie (beaten by Hearts)
King: Headless Phantasm (beaten by Diamonds)
Queen: Worms (beaten by Spades)

Aces/ Joker: Draw 2 additional cards face down

In order to beat the enemy, number on your card must be higher.

If you run out of cards, or hit by an enemy, you die

Good luck, hope to meet you at the Golden City

# Floe - Travelling the Multiverse

 
```
Suddenly, the Portal closes behind you. Your group of Shifters is stranded on the world of Awal that is vanishing into non-existence.
 
Can you find the Key to escape this looming doom?
 
First, describe the Shifters.
Every Player contributes two words or short sentences as character-defining Descriptors and one name. Distribute these evenly amongst you all. 

Second, describe your party. 
Together, write down three group-defining Descriptors.

Third, describe the world. 
Together, write down six Descriptors of what is left.

Descriptors are at stake in challenges of relevance to the story:
One success is needed for a relevant deed,
Two for an important deed,
Three for a truly pivotal deed widely recognized as heroic.
Throw one dice per applicable Descriptor. Even numbers count as successes.
 
If you fail, for each success you needed but did not get, any one Descriptor is lost forever (decide narratively).
For each successful pivotal deed, a new Descriptor is created.
 
To begin, the Narrator tells a legend of this realm.

To end the session, the Players tell a legend of what will be remembered.
 
To venture on, give the next world a name and one fewer Descriptor. How far can you go before you perish tragically?

# Double, double toil and trouble.
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Witches !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
This is a world building game where the players follow the flow of history as told through questions.
The players take on the role of witches scrying over a single world.
Play requires a magic-8 ball which when used provides random "yes" or "no" style answers with varying levels of confidence.
If the group has a preferred random answer generator, such as an oracle, they may use that instead.

To setup: Each Witch describes who they are, and states a detail about the world in which they all live. This creates a starting point for asking questions about said world.

Each Witch takes it in turn to scry by:
1) Asking a question that could be answered with either "yes" or "no".
2) Obtaining and recording an answer from the magic-8 ball. If the question relates to the answer from the prior question the group may decide to veto up to one nonsensical answer. The scrying witch must agree.
3) Pass play to the next Witch.

Sometimes apparent contradictions may occur. Lean into them. How they get resolved will reveal much about the world being explored.

As with life, these stories may have no end. Play until no longer fun.
