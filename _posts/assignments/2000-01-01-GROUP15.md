# Drunk Monk
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Alcohol Consumption, Religion !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
God: "You stupid f#$@% monks! You drank too much dang wine! You're no longer pure! You've sullied your souls, and must pilgrimage through treacherous terrain to find the Purity Pond and take a cleansing bath!"

*creates beacon of light in the distance indicating location of the Purity Pond*

Monks: "Oh shoot dang -BELCHh, we're gonna be setting off then."

REQUIRES
d4, d6, d8, d20, bottle caps/tokens, friends and beer

MAKE YOUR MONK
4 points divided across the 3 stats
Body for guesses on any physical actions
Mind for guesses on any mental actions
Heart for heartiness

God declares which dice He will be rolling. Bigger dice = Bigger challenge. He rolls in secret to get the Holy Number. If a monk wants to overcome an obstacle, they must guess the Holy Number. Every time they guess wrong, they must take a drink. 

Finish the beer to succeed even after failing to guess the Holy Number.

d20 is for a Group Action; monks guess the same Holy Number together. If anyone repeats a number, they drink twice for not staying focused.  

If failure means getting hurt (like fighting an ogre, or climbing a cliff) then they lose a Heart.

Drink Responsibly

# Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dice

 
```
3-7 players play as celebrity chefs. You each star in your own restaurant review show.

Describe your chef's:
Name
Culinary specialty or dietary restriction
Fashion
Vehicle
Catchphrase

Do not name your show yet.

Players take turns in clockwise order.

On your turn, pick another player to scout a restaurant for you to feature on your show. They describe the restaurant and the kind of food it serves. They then pick another player to play the restaurant's head chef. (This can be their celebrity chef or a new character - their choice.)

The head chef walks you through the preparation of one of their dishes. Feel free to interrupt to ask them to clarify things for the audience or to insert your hilarious catchphrase. Play things up for the camera. You're the star here, not them.

When the head chef is done, roll a d10 to determine how much you enjoy their food. Narrate your reaction as you eat the food on camera.

Once each player has had 2 turns (1 for 5+ players), you must end your episodes. In turn order, give your show's trademark sign-off line to the camera. Be sure to work your show's name into the sign-off.

# At Your Highness' Pleasure

 
```
You are ambitious advisors to the King, manipulating petitions to further your goals whilst hiding your darkest secrets.

Each advisor has a Name, Ambitious Goal, Deadly Secret, and one Petition Token.

Describe your advisor to the group and write their details face up and visible in front of you.

A petition is a single sentence that will create a new Law in the kingdom.

Once created, a Law cannot be changed.

Each round, one player takes the role of The Petitioner, writes a petition and passes it clockwise around the table.

Each advisor may give The Petitioner one Petition Token to DELETE, CHANGE, or INSERT a single Word within the petition.

Pass the petition around the table until everyone has had a chance to edit it once. 

The Petitioner then reads the petition aloud as if advising the King why it should be made Law.

Each player then reveals how the new Law furthers / obstructs their Ambitious Goal and hides / exposes their Deadly Secret.

Petitions cannot name an advisor or change a fact previously established about the world during play, and edited sentences must still be grammatically correct.

The game finishes once everyone has been The Petitioner 3 times.

# To dream is to understand

 
```
Players present the subconscious angst of their character, as manifested in dreams, while the other players attempt to decipher the dream. 

Game cards:
	DS: Dreamscape (many) - ex. schoolyard
        DT: Dream Type (some) - ex. falling
	DM: Dream Meaning (few) - ex. sibling rivalry
	TH: Therapy (some) - ex. Rorschach, word association

Setup:
Players self-select a character (ex. matador, elf)
Cards are sorted. Each player draws one DS, DT, DM, and TC. The remaining cards are collected and shuffled.

Play:
Current player draws a card and discards it - face up - or exchanges from his hand.
  If a Dx card: 
    Player describes one dream sequence using the information on the cards in their hand.
    Symbolism and analogy are used to disguise the meaning. Ex. peer pressure presents as a boulder on the chest. 
    Consistency between turns is expected.

  If a TC card: 
    A randomly selected player administers the therapy

Then a randomly selected player starts a clockwise round of analysis and proposes a meaning or passes.  

The hand goes until all players have been engaged. 
Only clarifying questions are allowed.  ex. "did you mean gliding or flying".

Once a player's dream is deciphered they discard their hand but may participate in the therapy or analysis.

# Keep It Together: A Game About Zombies

 
```

               You are zombies. Start with all LIMBS unless you choose otherwise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slot #     |   Limb         |      Actions                                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.         |   Head         |      Communication, Noticing, Cleverness, **Biting**      |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.         |   Arm          |      Dexterity, **Crawling**                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.         |   Second Arm   |      Lugging                                              |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.         |   Leg          |      Jumping, **Jump Scares**                             |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.         |   Second Leg   |      Stealth, **Running**                                 |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.         |   Fun Bits     |      Intimate Moments, Wacky Powers, **Creeping Out**     |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To perform ACTIONS, roll 1d8 using the appropriate LIMB'S # as TARGET (starred ACTIONS: +1 to TARGET per missing LIMB). If lacking appropriate LIMB, roll damage first ("Second Arm/Leg" ACTIONS require two arms/legs).
 
Rolling TARGET or lower = success. Upon failing, roll damage.

Roll damage using 1d6. If you have an appendage there, it's destroyed. If not, die. Revive at the end of the scene if another player survived/used a VICTIM.

After every scene you don't die in, do one:

- Scavenge THREAD or random LIMB

- Infect: must have bitten a human this scene. Upon death, you may live on as your VICTIM instead.

- Repair someone: spend one THREAD to attach one LIMB anywhere one's missing, even the "wrong" slot. Use the slot you attached it to when rolling damage, but that LIMB'S normal # for attempting ACTIONS. New Fun Bits can be anything: genitalia, chainsaws, backpacks.
