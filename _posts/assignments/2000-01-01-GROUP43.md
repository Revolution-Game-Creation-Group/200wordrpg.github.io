# Auspicious Ends

 
```
They told you that Something is coming in seven days, you all know in your bones that it's true.

Take a selection of dreamlike images (from the internet or a boardgame such as Dixit) as Omens and split them between everyone.

GM describe where the players are spending their last week before the Arrival. Players describe your characters.
Each player is the Fate of the player to their left - secretly write down 3 predictions:
Who they will be
What they will do
How they will die
Put down an Omen you feel represents each one in front of the player.

When you act, roll d6, 5-6 succeeds. Your Fate will place an additional d6 to roll on any Omen they feel the action plays into.

Each night, everyone has the same dream; a means to avert the coming doom? The GM selects an image to represent it. If they feel the players succeed at fulfilling the Omen in the following day, they mark a success.

At the end of 7 days. Look at how many successes were marked:
Describe how disaster was miraculously averted
Or
Describe how you somehow hold on
Or
Describe how it all falls apart

# Life is Hard
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
In Life is Hard, you must go about a totally normal day and survive. Goals are simple: Getting to class on time, for example Everyone is encouraged to play a character rather than relying on a single GM/DM, as all players are expected to tell the story together. 

Best done in round-table fashion, taking turns to take actions, everyone should narrate the person on their right, and once their portion of the action is complete, control passes to the person who just narrated.

To take an action, players roll a 20 sided dice, on a 15 plus, you succeed without issue, on a 14 or lower, something terrible happens. Attacked by savage squirrels while walking through the park, having to fight off the janitorial staff at school who all turned into zombies suddenly, use your imagination! Players must describe how they get out of these terrible happenings. Actions should be clear and concise, IE "Take a shortcut through the park". 

All players start with 0 damage marked, and take 1 damage from each terrible happening. Once they hit 5 damage, they're dead!

Game ends when all players or dead, or someone reaches the end of their daily routine.

# The Accord
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Politics, Religion, Possible dark or violent themes !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The Arch-Duke and The Tyrant have decreed that hostilities between human and monster kind must end. You are corrupt, squabbling dignitaries meeting at Blighthollow to draft the accord for this uneasy peace.
You have a Need that the truce threatens. Try to alter the accord to protect your Need.

Choose a role:
- Aristocrat (Trophies)
- Bishop (Rage)
- Champion (Enemy)
- Chancellor (Scapegoat)
- Inquisitor (Prey)
- Magistrate (Plunder)
- Necromancer (Carrion)
- Priest (Fear)
- Traitor (Protection)
- Warlord (Enemy)

Separate into Human and Monster contingents. Odd one out is a "neutral" signatory (pick a second need).

Describe your character in a few words or short sentences. Define your Need more fully.

Each contingent alternates proposing amendments to the accord. Neutral parties may also make proposals. Argue each proposal's merits and flaws in-character. Draw maps, take notes, world build and make side deals as you debate.

Anyone may call for a vote at any time. If seconded, vote on the amendment. With a majority vote, the amendment is ratified and added to the accord. You cannot repeat failed proposals.
Repeat until either contingent has no more amendments they wish to propose.

Discuss the fallout of the final accord. If your Need wasn't met, what is your fate?

# Rubik's Labyrinth

 
```
You have each been kidnapped and abandoned by the GM in a labyrinth controlled by a magic cube. You party up to try escape.
Have the GM scramble a Rubik's Cube and place it down. 
This is the 'gameboard'. Players start at the top-right and end at the bottom-left tile, moving in an 'S' shape.

Players create their character by choosing descriptors - name, 1 equip, 2 attributes.
The GM assigns a power value to each tile colour:
Sum of all (six) colours' values <= no. players times 6. 
Maximum colour value equals no. players times 3.

Each turn, the GM creates the conflict, using the tile's colour as a prompt. Players cooperate to create a plan of action that must incorporate a number of descriptors >= the colour's power value. Planning time = 15 times no. players in seconds.

If the party wins, they describe the outcome and move to the next tile.
If the party loses, GM describes the outcome and rotates 3 rows/columns. Then the party moves back one tile (move forward instead if on first tile).

When rotating, the party stays on their tile. Afterwards, their tile should face up. 

Party wins when the bottom-left tile's conflict is resolved.

# Dirty Papers

 
```
for 3-6 players

SUPPLIES
1+ pencils
Index cards
Paper
Dice

SETUP
You're an archaeological team in ancient ruins. One player is the Professor; going clockwise, each player has less seniority.

Each describe something about the landscape, ruins, and camp.

DIG DAYS
Start on Day 1. Progress starts at 1.

On each Day:
1) Roll dice equal to Progress. Even results are Finds. Add 1 Progress per Find.

2) Taking turns in seniority order, describe a Find, and write that on a card, until each is described.

3) Discuss these Finds. Write your interpretation of each on its card. Anyone above you can cross yours out; anyone above them can re-write it, and so on.

4) If you described none, or fewer than the Professor, describe something about the landscape, ruins, or camp.

5) Tally each player's interpretations (re-written ones count for each player who wrote them). In descending order, voice a judgement about the people who lived here. Later judgements cannot contradict earlier ones. Write them down.

Go to the next Day.

TURNING POINT
If a Day has 3+ Finds, do not increase Progress. On future Days, subtract 1 Progress per Find.

When Progress reaches 0, end the Dig.

# Together We Go - An Improv Roleplaying Game

 
```
A group of 5-10 people sit in a circle/ around a table. Drawn from a bowl, each player blindly chooses from Roles with a certain Gift;

A King - With Wisdom: a Voice Like a Drum
A Saint - With Faith : Hands that Heal
A Soldier - With Courage : a Rifle for Protection
A Scholar - With Reason: a Book Full of Words
A Shepherd - With Vigilance: a Flock to Guard
A Wizard - With Wit: a Staff of Illusion
A Peasant - With Sympathy: a Tankard of Ale
A Child - With Joy: the Toys of Youth
A Nobel - With Grace: the Coin of their Rank
Death - With Finality: the Scyth of Division

The story, told collectively and improvisationally through the different roles, focuses on a journey to:

Defeat a Great Evil
Find True Love
Break a Terrible Curse

Together players decide the type and, starting with the peasant, proceed clockwise. A player's role isn't revealed until the end of their turn. Items are used as plot elements and to transition between players. The goal is to keep the story going until Death's turn. When Death is reached they summarize and finalize the story, then collect the rolls back into the bowl to be redistributed.
