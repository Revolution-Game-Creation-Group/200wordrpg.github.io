# Auspicious Ends

 
```
They told you that Something is coming in seven days, you all know in your bones that it's true.

Take a selection of dreamlike images (from the internet or a boardgame such as Dixit) as Omens and split them between everyone.

GM describe where the players are spending their last week before the Arrival. Players describe your characters.
Each player is the Fate of the player to their left - secretly write down 3 predictions:
Who they will be
What they will do
How they will die
Put down an Omen you feel represents each one in front of the player.

When you act, roll d6, 5-6 succeeds. Your Fate will place an additional d6 to roll on any Omen they feel the action plays into.

Each night, everyone has the same dream; a means to avert the coming doom? The GM selects an image to represent it. If they feel the players succeed at fulfilling the Omen in the following day, they mark a success.

At the end of 7 days. Look at how many successes were marked:
Describe how disaster was miraculously averted
Or
Describe how you somehow hold on
Or
Describe how it all falls apart

# Gander Reveal Party

 
```
Players: 8-20

Time: 30 minutes 

-Supplies: Name tags

-Theme: You were invited by someone to their "Gander Reveal Party" and assumed it was a typo, until your friend introduced their goose.

-Safety: Cut and Brake.  Players should set limits on Goose behavior.

-Characters: 

*Host*: Host loves everyone at the party and wants them to share their excitement.

*Goose*: Goose hates everyone.  Goose runs around, attacks people, honks, and knocks stuff over. If Host says, "Bad Goose," Goose should act worse.  If Host says "be a good goose," Goose should calm down, but still be bad.

*Friends and family*: You're here to be excited about a new baby.

-Character Creation:

Stand in a circle.  Introduce yourselves, say why you dislike the person to your right. Host likes everyone, Goose likes no one. Do Name Tags.


-Gameplay:

The party starts with Host welcoming everyone and then making a quick exit.  Give people a few minutes before returning and then call for attention.  Say you know why you're all here and then introduce Goose.  Let Goose loose in the room. Use Goose mechanics to help modulate Goose player.  The game ends when Host kicks everyone out of their house.

# The Inevitable Decision (1 GM & 1+ Players)

 
```
"You used to be a barista. Now, you're a God... AND a barista." This game is about balancing humanity and newly-discovered divinity, and the inevitable decision you must face.

About-You
- Name
- Domain
- Dayjob
- The Scale. Where you stand between your Mortal life and your Divine powers. 3 Divine = -3 Mortal, and vice-versa. +3 Max.
- Bonds-Alliances. These represent your Mortal & Divine relationships. You have thirteen of each.

When there's uncertainty, determine if you're performing Mortal or Divine actions. For Mortal Actions, roll 1d6+Mortal+Bonds. For Divine Actions, roll 1d6+Divine+Alliances. 1-3 = Fail. 4-6 = Success. You may spend Alliances-Bonds to boost Mortal-Divine actions respectively.

When you help people, or otherwise prioritize humanity, you may gain a bond or shift towards Mortal. You lose an Alliance. When you ignore people, or otherwise prioritize Divinity, you may gain an Alliance or shift towards Divine. You lose a Bond.

The Decision. What young Gods fear. Will you give up on humanity or divinity? When you have no Bonds, you have no reason to stay. You leave and become a God forever. When you have no Alliances, you have no power among Gods. You give up and remain human.

# Dreams of the Old Worm

 
```
You (four): Dreamshapers (sorcerers)
You (one): Rang, the Old Worm (senator)
You (all) need: marker, whiteboard, playing cards (54)
Rang has bad policies but believes in the people's will. He is dreaming (and therefore connected to other dreamers). Dreamshapers will change his dreams.
First turn (Rang): Describe your dream in three sentences. Write the sentences out. Place a card on the table for each significant detail (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, conjunction, preposition) given. Rang plays face-down cards.
First turn (Dreamshapers): Draw three cards from the deck, and flip the table's cards face-up. Every dreamshaper takes a turn placing a card on top of one of the table's cards with the same value or suit. A Joker overwrites anything. Speak of the new detail; how did the dream change?
Other turns (Rang): After all Dreamshapers go, replace a detail by replacing a table card with a face-down card from the deck. Describe what changed.
Other turns (Dreamshapers): Flip the card face-up. Take another round replacing cards and describing changes.
Play continues between Rang and Dreamshapers until Dreamshapers are out of cards. Rang takes the last turn. He wakes up and tells his chamberlain his dream. What is his new plan?

# Hirelings

 
```
You're all hirelings of an adventuring party. Write down 3 abilities for your character - nothing heroic! Introduce yourselves. Explain your situation, where you are, and why you're the only survivors. 

Take turns round the table. On your turn set the scene, describing an obstacle between you and safety. Other players may add details. Say how the heroes would have resolved it and set a numerical difficulty (at least 1).

Then everyone holds a fist out, then opens it simultaneously. Players who reveal a die are helping, the others hide.

If everyone hides, everyone is wounded.

(If you are wounded - cross out an ability. If you can't, you're dead. You may still take turns narrating.)

Otherwise, all helping players roll one (six-sided) die, plus one for each ability they can justify using.

If you collectively roll as many sixes as the difficulty, success! All helping players gain Glory equal to the difficulty. The player with the highest total roll gets twice as much.

Whether you succeed or fail, the helping player with the highest (or tied highest) total roll is wounded.

After everyone has taken two turns, the surviving player with the highest Glory wins. If you all die, no-one wins.

# Incubate

 
```
This game requires:
- 4 players (3 Bearers, 1 Serpent of Death)
- One egg (a real one)

This is the World-Egg. Your sacred lands have been killed by the High Cities of Troke. The World-Egg must hatch to start the Universe anew.

Bearers:

- You must take the World-Egg to the World's End. 
- Stand about a meter away from each other. 
- One of you holds the egg.

Each Bearer chooses a different duty:

SPEAKER
PATHFINDER
PROTECTOR

The Serpent of Death:

- You desire to see the World-Egg shatter.
- Stalk around the circle 
- Conjure up obstacles between Bearers and the End.

Example Obstacles:
-- Citizens of Troke where they disdain belief in the World-Egg,
-- Shadow creatures that use dreams as blades,
-- Twisting landscapes that trick and snare,
-- All else that is evil.

Bearers describe how they overcome obstacles, then must throw the egg to the Bearer with the relevant duty. If that Bearer already has the egg, Bearers must find another approach.

After catching the egg, take a half step back.

If the egg breaks, the Universe dies. 

If Bearers overcome nine obstacles, they have reached the World's End and the World-Egg hatches. All of time and space is reborn. The Serpent hibernates. Rejoice.
