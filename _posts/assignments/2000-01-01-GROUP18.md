# FINAL ATTACK

 
```
You are COLORFUL HEROES piloting a MACHINE OF INCREDIBLE POWER. Over the course of many trials and tribulations, your battle against the EMPEROR OF DARKNESS has come down to this: the FINAL ATTACK.

Establish your team and your own hero. What binds you together? Which hero understands your sacrifices?

Consider the Emperor of Darkness. What is their plan? What challenges have you overcome? What sacrifices have been demanded of your team?

Consider the location this showdown occurs in. What threatens you? What must you protect?

As the situation surrounding the final attack becomes evident, it is time to muster your energies. Your attack begins with a number of d6 in the pool equal to the number of players. Consider elements that make the situation more or less desperate, generated in the questions above. For each positive, add a d6. For each negative, remove one.

When you launch the attack, roll the pool. Based on the highest result achieved, narrate your epilogue:

Multiple Sixes: Total victory. What does tomorrow bring?
Six: Victory. How has the battle changed you?
Four-Five: Sacrifice. What does victory cost?
Two-Three: Retreat. What more do you need to win?
One: Defeat. What hope do you leave behind?

# MADNESS MADNESS MADNESS M DNE S MA   SS MADNE

 
```
You are hunted

When you glimpse the visage of your predator, write its name on your paper
When you are harmed, tear off a bit of your paper

        No paper
            no blood
                        death

            Muddled paper
                no sanity
                            madness

When you encounter challenge, roll your three dice on your paper

An eleven succeeds
Dice on the paper are counted

You are good at one, bad at another and gain or lose a die in context:

    scrambling

            struggling


                        interpreting

When you are bleeding, roll 
patch on some torn paper
When you want to clear your head, roll
erase that many letters
                            but will you be caught in invigilance?


Steal a car; grab a brick; brandish a cross; flee to sunlight; plead;
                                        did it help?

# The Long Stair

 
```
Our world has ended.

To repair the disparate strands, gather:

]__  A special Token.
     ]__  An illustrated Tarot Deck.
          ]__  And three Perspectives.

Each Perspective claims an aspect of The Wanderer:

Past (Before the End) / Present (In the Wasteland) / Future (Upon The Long Stair)

As we rediscover: Our Origins / Our Self / Ourselves.

Prepare the cards.

Major Arcana embody the Obstacles in our path.

Minor Arcana are the People / Places / Things that spur us on.

Separate and shuffle the two decks.

Each Perspective draws an Obstacle. Place it face up in a staggered row, like steps.

The first of three Flights.

Each poses a question.
 
]__  How did the world end?
     ]__  Who have we become?
          ]__  What might we hold on to?

These are but examples. Let them inspire you.

Art / Text / Subtext

Claim the Token to set a scene exploring your Obstacle.

When the time is right, turn a Minor Arcana face up. Give it life.

Accept it to Bridge Past to Present to Future to ...

Pass or claim the Token to explore another Perspective.

Become an advocate for their Obstacle. Become a force for growth.

Paint The Wanderer in three voices.

]__  Bridge the cards.
     ]__  Draw the next Flight.
          ]__  Discover yourself.

Then fade to black.

# ROBOT FIGHT

 
```
Players:

Create a robot.

Divide twenty points into its Legs, Arms, Torso and Head. (minimum 1, maximum 5)

You have two legs and arms by default and you need to divide points separately into both.

Choose one module per location. Modules allow for subtle changes to rules: attacking with a location other than arms, attacking at range, etc.

Your Defence is equal to your current total in your Legs locations.

Name your Robot.

Fight:

When you attack roll 1d6+current total in Arms. If you roll equal to or higher than your opponent's Defence, you hit.

Roll 1d6 to determine hit location.
1. Left leg
2. Right leg
3. Left arm
4. Right arm
5. Torso
6. Head

By default, Robots can only punch. This can be changed with modules like weapons.

Attacks deal 1d6 damage. Deduct damage from appropriate location. If Head is brought to zero, your defence is halved and you must roll 2d6 to attack and use the lower. If Torso is brought to zero, your robot is destroyed.

GM:

Populate your world with robots for your players to fight and give them a reason to fight them.

Chew the scenery.

Hack.

# A Game of Cards

 
```
Required: Deck of playing cards, Notecards, Pencils
All players sit in a circle or around a table. Every player but one receives a notecard. They write one defining character trait on the piece of paper then pass it to their left. Each player writes a second trait on the card they received then pass it on. Each player writes a name on the card they receive then pass it.
The player with no character is the storyteller, the players with notecards play the character on their card. 
Everyone is dealt eight playing cards. When a character faces an obstacle, they and the storyteller each play a card. If the storyteller's card is lower, the character succeeds. The cards are discarded.
When a player runs out of cards, they draw eight more. If the storyteller runs out of cards, all characters and the role of storyteller get passed to the left, and the previous storyteller draws eight new cards.
When all cards have been drawn, discarded cards are shuffled into a new draw pile. At any time, a player may play a joker or four of a kind. All cards are reshuffled and players draw new cards.

# BE THE MOTHERF***ING LORAX

 
```
A player chooses a tree to claim. They must yell "I SPEAK FOR THIS TREE!" 

Each player must defend why they speak for that tree, they must include in their statement;

What kind of tree it is (you can name any type of tree or make up a name for it).
What this tree wants to say.
How the tree got there. Were they simply planted there? Were they from far away? 

Each player must then declare something the tree needs to continue being successful. 

In order to get the things the tree needs they must ask people around them, who are NOT Lorax's. In order to ask for things they can casually ask them, sing it, scream it at them (in a non-threatening way). If they say no to whatever you request just walk away. If they say yes, then start to persuade them to join you in being a Lorax for your tree. 

If someone willingly approaches you and your tree, the only thing you are allowed to say to them "I AM THE LORAX AND I SPEAK FOR THIS TREE!"

Game is over once it reaches 15 Lorax's. The game must start with at least 3 Lorax's.

# "The Worm"

 
```
This is it, the culmination of years of research in "anthropological study of 20th century dance", and finally, you and you alone have scoured the fossil record, remaining written documentation, fragments of "YouTube" videos and have finally discovered the true form of an ancient dance known as simply "The Worm".

Except, somehow, other scholars landed on the same subject matter and the damned conference has arranged a live peer review. Only one of you can go on to wow the scientific world with your transformational discovery.

Oldest player goes first.

i. Stand in front of the other players. They should be seated, with notebooks, and stern looks.

ii. Describe in detail how you came to this discovery. The research you did and how you placed each piece into the larger puzzle. Use jargon to convince them you know what you are talking about.

iii. Demonstrate "The Worm" as your reconstruction supposes it must be. It's ok to be stiff or without rhythm, you're an academic.

iv. The other players will write down review scores for "Supporting Evidence", "Compelling Case", "Convincing Demonstration"

When everyone has presented, the best reviewed presentation wins. As best you know, that dance is "The Worm".
