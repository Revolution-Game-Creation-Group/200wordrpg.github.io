# FINAL ATTACK

 
```
You are COLORFUL HEROES piloting a MACHINE OF INCREDIBLE POWER. Over the course of many trials and tribulations, your battle against the EMPEROR OF DARKNESS has come down to this: the FINAL ATTACK.

Establish your team and your own hero. What binds you together? Which hero understands your sacrifices?

Consider the Emperor of Darkness. What is their plan? What challenges have you overcome? What sacrifices have been demanded of your team?

Consider the location this showdown occurs in. What threatens you? What must you protect?

As the situation surrounding the final attack becomes evident, it is time to muster your energies. Your attack begins with a number of d6 in the pool equal to the number of players. Consider elements that make the situation more or less desperate, generated in the questions above. For each positive, add a d6. For each negative, remove one.

When you launch the attack, roll the pool. Based on the highest result achieved, narrate your epilogue:

Multiple Sixes: Total victory. What does tomorrow bring?
Six: Victory. How has the battle changed you?
Four-Five: Sacrifice. What does victory cost?
Two-Three: Retreat. What more do you need to win?
One: Defeat. What hope do you leave behind?

# Reciprocation

 
```
Reciprocation

Rule number 1: During this game, you may not say in character anything that you believe to be true about a player out of character.

The richest player will plunge their arm into a bag of rice. They will draw out a fistful and move across the room to place it in their bowl. The other players will catch fallen grains in their own bowls. For every grain they catch they must thank their benefactor. They must earnestly flatter them for every grain, one by one. They must describe their fictional life and their great deeds. Praise the following:

Ruthlessness
Opulence
Fairness
Intelligence
Physical appearance
Devotion to a deity
Virility
Skill in a profession
Honesty
Humility

After drawing rice, choose the next player to draw a smaller fist of rice. If they take too much, prevent them. Repeat this until everyone has drawn rice. Weigh your bowls. The player with the lightest bowl has been lying. They must retract their praise and speak the truth instead, whilst continuing to respect rule number 1. For every insult they may take rice for themselves, and continue until their bowl is the heaviest. When this is done, prepare a meal together.

# At Your Highness' Pleasure

 
```
You are ambitious advisors to the King, manipulating petitions to further your goals whilst hiding your darkest secrets.

Each advisor has a Name, Ambitious Goal, Deadly Secret, and one Petition Token.

Describe your advisor to the group and write their details face up and visible in front of you.

A petition is a single sentence that will create a new Law in the kingdom.

Once created, a Law cannot be changed.

Each round, one player takes the role of The Petitioner, writes a petition and passes it clockwise around the table.

Each advisor may give The Petitioner one Petition Token to DELETE, CHANGE, or INSERT a single Word within the petition.

Pass the petition around the table until everyone has had a chance to edit it once. 

The Petitioner then reads the petition aloud as if advising the King why it should be made Law.

Each player then reveals how the new Law furthers / obstructs their Ambitious Goal and hides / exposes their Deadly Secret.

Petitions cannot name an advisor or change a fact previously established about the world during play, and edited sentences must still be grammatically correct.

The game finishes once everyone has been The Petitioner 3 times.

# One Thousand Cuts

 
```
A game for a handful of players without a GM.

-

You are telling the story of friendships that span lives. Scenes can be years or decades apart.

-

Together, decide what kind of world your story is set in - realistic, fantasy, sci-fi...

-

Each name your character. Each write on your arm your character's:

- Wildest dream
- Grandest plan
- Greatest fear
- Biggest regret

Number these traits 1-4 in a random, personal order.

-

Rotate between different pairs of players in individual scenes, prioritising pairs who've not yet played together. Roll 2d4 for the setting.

- familiar
- unknown
- dangerous
- safe

- home
- business
- transportation
- wilderness

-

Before playing the scene, play rock-paper-scissors. Whoever loses will lose a trait by the end of the scene. Traits are lost in number order.

Narrate and role-play the scene, revealing how the friendship made them surrender their dream, abandon their plan, overcome their fear, or cast off their regret. 

At the end of the scene, completely cover the lost trait with a plaster/band-aid. Write the other character's name on the plaster.

-

Keep playing until everyone's arms are covered in plasters bearing the names of those who shaped them. Consider how different the characters are to when you began.

# Amnesia Assassin

 
```
Pick who the assassin will be this round and have them go out of the room. Establish where you are, what jobs you have, who is the boss, and what you are doing. Decide a certain obscure action for the assassin to do to prove their an assassin, this will come into play. Start pantomiming typical actions that would occur at this location and job. Have the assassin come back in. They have to assimilate with the group, blend in with their surroundings, and get the feel of the place. They have been sent to kill the leader of this group, but have lost their memory. Without being suspicious, they have to ask questions and figure out what's happening, then identify who the boss is and kill them by saying their full title. Ex. "I assassinate you, the judge!" The other players try to win by getting the assassin to do the predetermined obscure action the group agreed upon, and therefore blowing the killer's cover.
