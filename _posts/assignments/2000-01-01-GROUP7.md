# Everything I Gave, I Gave For You
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Parenthood, motherhood, parent-child relationships !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Held in your arms is a life. 
You bore them in you, gave them blood and oxygen. 
Now they breathe alone, yet need you more than ever.
Let no harm come to them.
They require sacrifice. You will give more than your share.
You begin with four Boons and four Flaws. The life in your arms has none. 
When troubles face you, roll 1d10 and 1d6. 
If a Boon aides you, roll another d10. If a Flaw hinders you, roll another d6. 
If the total of your d10s equals or beats your d6s, you succeed; the trouble is overcome. Remove a Boon from yourself and grant one of your choice to the life in your arms.
If the total is lower, you are hindered and face fresh trouble; choose one of your Flaws for the life in your arms to inherit. You retain the Flaw. If the life has all your Flaws, create one extra just for them.
When you have no Boons left, your work is done. 
The life in your arms may walk the way without you now, to face their own troubles. 
One day they may hold a life of their own, beautiful and flawed.

# The Love-Stained Wisdom King
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Lust !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Play as you read.

Imagine someone most perfectly worthy of your lust. Burn in your desire for them. Feel this pain, which is real.

Imagine that all motion ceases in the universe. Imagine that Ragaraja appears before you, in this eternal moment, with his six treasures in his six hands. He will present each and shock you into contemplation, transforming lust into insight.

First is his Bell. Your heart is focused by its sound.
    In what colors do your flames burn?
    By what names are your emotions called?

Second is his Thunderbolt. Your heart is electrified by its power.
    With what sounds do your flames burn?
    By what forms are your emotions shaped?

Third is his Lotus. Your heart is lulled by its serenity.
    In what motion do your flames burn?
    By what dreams are your emotions ignited?

Fourth is his Bow. Your heart is agitated by its majesty.
    Within what limits do your flames burn?
    By what courses will your emotions tamed?

Fifth is his Arrow. Your heart is joyed by its forthrightness.
    From what fuels do your flames burn?
    By what actions will your emotions unleashed?

Last is something you cannot see.

Ragaraja departs.

The game is over.

# Auntie Comes to Tea
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Consent, pushing boundaries, analogies to partner/date rape !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Auntie Comes to Tea is a duet game about boundaries and consent. The two characters haven't seen each other for awhile. One character, Auntie, dearly wants to catch up over tea. The other character, Host, doesn't want to see this family member.

1.	Decide who will be Auntie and who will be the Host.
2.	Write down your character's name, pronouns, and other important details.
3.	Decide why you haven't seen each other in some time.
4.	Decide together or separately:
a.	Auntie, what do you miss about Host?
b.	Host, why do you want to avoid Auntie?

Auntie narrates beginning the conversation (phone, bumping into each other, etc.). Share pleasantries and small talk. Play truly begins when Auntie asks Host if they want to have afternoon tea sometime: 

Unless Host gives a clear 'Yes' or 'No', Auntie must keep making requests for afternoon tea. 

Host, you are worried about offending Auntie, so must reject Auntie's requests without saying 'Yes' or 'No' for as long as possible.

Play ends when Host gives a clear 'Yes' or 'No'. Narrate your characters parting ways. Debrief your feelings, the discomfort or difficulty of saying 'No', and how it relates to the real world.

<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Tragedy, Horror !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The dustmen see what others do not in the predawn gloom. They protect the city from the horrors and collect rubbish.

Each night's patrol comprises of 7 scenes framed by the dustmen. Successes advance the horror clock or collect rubbish. Each horror is unique and has 1d4+2 clock segments. The truck should be full of 4 rubbish by dawn.

If the horror clock is filled, the dustmen confront the horror at dawn. Victory heals the city by one. City health starts at 4.

If the horror clock is not filled, the city loses one health to the horror.

If the truck is not full a dustmen loses 1 of their 4 health.

Dustmen can be Brave, Bold, Brutal, and Brilliant. Assign +2, +1, 0 and -1. When you roll 10+ you choose one, on a 7-9 you choose two. Use 2d6.

When overwhelmed, roll plus Brave:
- An object damaged.
- Pursuit.
- Take harm.
- Help is needed.

When equally matched, roll plus Bold:
- A temporary victory.
- A permanent disadvantage.
- A frustrating stalemate.
- Depleted resources.

When overwhelming, roll plus Brutal:
- Shame.
- Dishonourable actions.
- Exhaustion.
- Unwanted attention.

When thinking, roll plus Brilliant:
- Lost time.
- Exposure.
- Doomful tidings.
- An unpleasant bargain.

# Queer Eyes on Stalks
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death (in the context of wholesome family show Queer Eye which probably makes it worse) !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
(For 3+ players.)

One person plays an arrogant and paranoid Beholder who feels a bit stuck in life and is ready to accept positive change through a make-over TV-show.

They decide some things about the beholder, which are known to the other players at the start of the game.

Name
Who nominated you
An event that's coming up that you're preparing for

Secretly, decided the following:

Something touchy you'd kill someone for mentioning
Most dangerous part of lair
One positive personal connection
The individual effects of your ten eye rays


Everyone else makes an adventurer:

Name
Class (such as wizard, food and wine expert, personal trainer, therapist, bard, stylist, etc.)
Why you naively think you have a good chance of making it out alive


Create short scenes between one adventurer and the beholder. The other players play producers (and minor characters) and decide what's the premise for each scene before it begins.

After each adventurer who is still alive has had four scenes with the beholder. Narrate the event and how the beholder has changed.

Everyone separately writes down what the lesson learnt was. Judge your success on how close / coherent your answers were.

# Cursed Adventures

 
```
Draw a king, whose suit determines your adventurer's curse:
Heart: Heart encounters heal you for half as much.
Diamond: You take 1 damage at the beginning of every turn.
Club: Subtract 1 from every die you roll.
Spade: Your lowest die doesn't count when you attack

To start, you get 2 d6's for attacking. You start with 20 max health.

To fight: Take turns rolling your attack dice. Subtract the total from your enemies health.

Every round draw 1 card for every player in game. Decide who will take each card. These cards determine your encounters, as follows:
Heart: You meet a healer. Describe them. Heal player for card's value.
Diamond: Take the card. If the diamond cards you are holding have a combined value of 6 or greater, then you may discard them to level up. When you level up, add 10 to your max health, and take 1 more d6 attack die.
Club or Spade: You encounter an enemy with health equal to card value and d6's for attack equal to card value divided by 4, rounded up. Describe your enemy, then fight.

Everyone loses when anyone's hp reaches 0.
If you clear the whole deck, you win!
