# Everything I Gave, I Gave For You
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Parenthood, motherhood, parent-child relationships !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Held in your arms is a life. 
You bore them in you, gave them blood and oxygen. 
Now they breathe alone, yet need you more than ever.
Let no harm come to them.
They require sacrifice. You will give more than your share.
You begin with four Boons and four Flaws. The life in your arms has none. 
When troubles face you, roll 1d10 and 1d6. 
If a Boon aides you, roll another d10. If a Flaw hinders you, roll another d6. 
If the total of your d10s equals or beats your d6s, you succeed; the trouble is overcome. Remove a Boon from yourself and grant one of your choice to the life in your arms.
If the total is lower, you are hindered and face fresh trouble; choose one of your Flaws for the life in your arms to inherit. You retain the Flaw. If the life has all your Flaws, create one extra just for them.
When you have no Boons left, your work is done. 
The life in your arms may walk the way without you now, to face their own troubles. 
One day they may hold a life of their own, beautiful and flawed.

# Pet, The Shadow

 
```
Humans never could prove the existence of supernatural because their pets fight the underworld everyday. You are a pet investigating and trying to stop darkness from destroying humankind. 

Choose a pet species and a name.
Describe the pet and it's background. Choose an extraordinary talent you're known for. You start with a 1d6 Darkness Dice at 1.

If you feel that you can fail at something, roll 2d6: 1-6 you fail; 7-9 you succeeds with a cost; and 10-12 you succeeds. If your background or species gives you some advantage, add 1 do the dice result. If is the case of disadvantage, less 1.

Everytime you find something supernatural or disturbing, roll your 1d6 Darkness dice. If the result is bigger than your actual number, add 1 to it. When you reach 6 you're lost and became a violent crazy killer beast. Create a new character, then. 

Magic can be used and it is connected with your talent, but it costs Darkness dice rolls, everytime. The Dark Plain can be seen when you reach 5 in Darkness Dice. Each game session your Darkness comes back 1.

# Agile Ribbit-ribbit, my Creators salute you!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Depending on all players' choices game might include ANY kind of animals trying to TEAR YOU APART.

A party game of incorrect assumptions for minimum four players.

Players are amorphous technoblobs, tasked by their CREATORS with contacting Earthlings, bound by:

Biased instructions - to "Copy NATIVES' form and behavior to facilitate the contact". CREATORS are uniform and they evolved on perfectly monotypic planet. Concepts like "lesser species", "diversity's consequences" are meaningless to them.
 
Matter - Ants? Elephants? Whatever you resemble, you weigh 1 lb with size to scale.

Everyone puts same number (3 + planned number of rounds) of unrevealed animal names (no microorganisms) into the drawing bag. 

Everyone draws from the bag to meet their first NATIVE. They depart before you finish morphing, but you are ready... for some rushed ASSUMPTIONS. 

Everyone, in turns:
====
Share your assumptions on how your CURRENT form signifies SAPIENCE.
Search for another NATIVE: draw from the bag.
Strive to achieve communication, against remaining players collectively roleplaying the NATIVE, reaching "consensus" by: first come, first served, unless second is funnier! 
Reassemble yourself if required, accept and analyze your failure aloud, morph into the NATIVE just met.
====
After a full round, each player distributes four points among two opponents, awarding most entertaining attempts.
Start next round, or:

Tally the scorecard and declare the winner.

# Paragraphs & Pommels

 
```

The GM is known as the Hero, and the PCs are known as the Weapons. The Hero can only bring one Weapon into the dungeon.

Before you begin coercing the Hero, each Weapon must roll a D6 to determine how much time they have to convince why they should be used. Each Weapon rolls and multiplies the result by 10. This gives them a time limit in seconds. 

After you have selected which Weapon you are, you must convince the Hero why you should be chosen. Each Weapon has a restriction, and a number of seconds on the clock. If you mess up, keep going! After everyone has gone, the Hero chooses who to take. They win! 

Weapons

Sword: Communicate only through gestures. 

Warhammer: Make intense eye contact, unblinking. 

Bow: Speak from outside the room or very far away.

Mace: Only speak in verbs. 

Dagger: Whisper very quietly. 

Spellbook: Spell out every single word. 

Axe: Shout everything in one breath. 

Nunchuck: Repeat every word twice. 

Rapier: Only speak in Adjectives.

Shield: Speak very defensively. 

Spiked Boots: Kick the air with every word. 

Ancient Weapon: Speak in an imaginary language.

# Abyss of Damned Souls

 
```
You're dead.

You got lost and went where all lost things and forgotten places go.

You'll need one suit from a card deck. Take 2-10 and choose one face card.
  Jack is sneaky.
  Queen is charming.
  King is violent.
  Ace is clever.
This small deck is your soul.

Actions have difficulty determined by the Abyss*. Draw a higher card to succeed. When you draw your face card, you automatically succeed and reshuffle your deck. You may discard extra cards to sum them with an already drawn card, but only if the action corresponds to your face card. Discarded cards are gone forever.

In conflict, opponents draw from their decks and the higher card wins. Winner takes the card of the looser, both discard their card in a draw. When only your face card remains, you fade away.

The Abyss will throw obstacles and monsters** in your way, and reward achievements with inhuman powers.

You'll loose pieces of your soul, then patch the holes with stolen bits of others. Your deck will change, until nothing from you remains.

You'll be a monster.

Damn you,
damn us all.


*) Gamemaster
**) Monsters may be customized by the size and value of their deck.

# Feeding the Demons
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Trump reference !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
For 2+ players.

Gather at night. The Summoning will ease three negative emotions. Decide which emotions to bring with you: hate, greed, pain, sorrow, envy etc. Different players can bring different emotions.

Bring news articles / printouts of social media posts / books / flammable objects that evoke those emotions. These are your sacrifices.

Light an open flame. You will be burning things, so make sure it's safe to do so.

Say this together: "Scavengers and tricksters, accept our offerings. Dine on our scraps and lick our tears."

Go round the circle. Each player holds up a sacrifice and speaks according to this formula:
"Listen, you who [past action]. Behold a [description of sacrifice]. I charge you: [imperative action]."

For example: "Listen, you who forged speech. Behold a man with the best words. I charge you: curse his lies so that he must answer for them."

Burn the sacrifice. Together, say: "Hear our pleas and send us aid."

Move on to the next player. Save your most heartfelt sacrifices for last.

When all sacrifices are burnt, speak together: "Hidden, you swallow our hidden prayers. May your bellies be full and our hearts lighter."

Put out the flame.

# Scry - a quick game about fate

 
```
SETUP
Requires major+minor tarot deck and 2+ players. Separate major from minor and shuffle each well, then rotate half of each 180 then shuffle well. Use tarot reading guide for meanings.

CORE
Draw two major arcana each. These anchor characters. Who they are and what they face/want. Lay one minor arcana face down before each character. These are Epilogues. Describe characters and setting, drawing cards for inspiration. Characters take turns describing their actions in pursuing their ends. When luck would affect the outcome of an action, draw a minor arcana. This is your fate. If it is upright you describe the outcome using the card's reading. If it is inverted somebody else describes the outcome using that reading. Once only you may play a card as if you drew it the other way up but it then replaces your epilogue as it was drawn. Rock paper scissors for PvP. Each player draw a card to help describe why they succeeded or failed. Play until the deck is finished. Then players take turns flipping their epilogues. Upright, you get what you want, Inverted, you don't. Use the reading to describe why your character succeeded or failed.
