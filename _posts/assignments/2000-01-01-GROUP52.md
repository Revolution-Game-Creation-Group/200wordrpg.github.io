# Last Rites
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Blood !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
2+ Players
Needs: A timer, pen and paper
 
The villain that's hounded you and your friends for years is on the ground, bleeding to death. Out of desperation, they ask for a chance to explain their actions.
 
Designate one person as the villain, and the others as adventurers. Each adventurer writes down a crime the villain has committed against them.
 
Set the timer to 10 minutes and reveal the crimes to the villain, then count to five and start the timer. The villain picks a crime and explains why they chose to commit it, and the adventurers may ask questions as they like. Whenever an adventurer is satisfied, they may write an X next to that crime. When half the adventurers, rounded up, have written an X, cross that crime out and add five minutes to the timer. The villain repeats the process with a new crime.
 
When all crimes have been crossed out, the villain is allowed to live. The adventurers may choose what the villain must do afterwards as penance.
 
When the timer ends, the villain breathes their last and dies.

# Congratulations on your Planet!

 
```
Congratulations!

[PLANET NAME HERE]'s construction is nearing completion, so we've gathered you all to begin evaluation. Most architects work independently, so you may need to introduce yourselves and your areas of expertise. Your individual experiences with the clients may need to be shared as well.

Corporate has created a prototype orbital tracking analysis topographical object, or POTATO. One of you should have the POTATO with you. It is a miniature version of the planet you have been working on all this time.

Analyze the POTATO. Each architect should specify which locations they are most proud of. Does it differ from your home planet? If you have any grievances with other architects, now may be the time to air them. Please let us know if there is anything on the POTATO that you feel was misrepresented, and feel free to mark the POTATO as such.

We only have time left to make one major change to [PLANET NAME HERE], so please inform us what you have agreed upon as the most important fix for the planet. Altering the POTATO to match might be a helpful visual aid.

Best Wishes,
Starch Industries Board of Directors

```
Requirements: 2 people, several quarters and a six-sided die (D6).

The GM rolls for and describes the engagement. The Symb describes how they help, identifies a relevant skill and rolls a D6. The roll is modified by +3 for Great, +2 for Good and -1 for Terrible.

The GM narrates results:

1-4: Failure. Gain $0.50.
5-6: Success. Gain $0.75.

9+: Extraordinary. Win the Jackpot!

Players swap roles after each engagement. Unearned bounties accumulate as the Jackpot. Engagements should be quick and memorable!

# Super Dupes!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Humor, lack of seriousness !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
To make your super, you gotta give:

-a secret identity (the man/woman/attack helicopter behind the mask)

-Some powers (being God, literally or otherwise, doesn't count)

-Something to power you up in your hour of need.  That's your spinach
-Something to be your kryptonite (spinach on opposite day)
Power level (starts at 3)

Gameplay:
     When it's time to use your powers, roll [power level] d6s and assign any three to the following statements:
     [ ] I did the thing
     [ ] Nobody got hurt
     [ ] Nothing got broken
1-3s bad (player describes how) but pay 1 experience, 4-6s good.  

Got spinach? Get a reroll!  
Got? kryptonite? DM rerolls for you.
Spinach and keeping cancel each other out in their mutual emnity.

     Now if everything goes wrong, you lose a power level.  Got none? you're done.


Spending that sweet XP after session:
     1 XP- Change your superhero name... and maybe your custome while you're at it

     2 XP- Find a new spinach.

     3 XP- up that power level.

     4 XP- Find a new kryptonite.

     10 XP- actually retire.  Peace out!

# ConjuRat

 
```
He's the talentless son of a legendary wizard. You are a rat skilled in the arcane arts. When you first met, you immediately recognized the significance of your pairing, and teamed up to collaboratively become the greatest mage ever.
As a rat, you cannot be seen performing magic or else you will be killed or worse. As the son of a legendary wizard, he cannot be exposed as a failure or else he will be ostracized. You found a solution. You hide under his hat and guide his actions, either whispering in his ear or pulling his hair to steer him, and he keeps your presence a secret. Together, you appear to be a single, powerful wizard. But how long can the charade last?

Strong moves: spend a token to
Get out of trouble
Cast ancient magic
Take full control
Change someone's mind

Standard moves: whenever you want
Act boldly, leaving yourself vulnerable
Cast skillful magic
Provide useful advice to the human
Misdirect with magic or trickery
Find a place to hide

Weak moves: gain a token whenever you
Expose the truth to someone
Leave the human at a critical moment
Draw unwanted attention
Cast a spell beyond your abilities

# Gender Bender

 
```
Gender's weird. Is it what's in your pants? What you wear? How you interact with others? In this GM-less game, you play characters struggling with these questions and how to best express themselves.

On slips of paper, write:
 -a gender assignment (M/F)
 -a gender role (a role placing one in a gendered group, e.g. housewife, lesbian)
 -a gender expression (observable behavior/appearance, e.g. butch, goth clown)
Pass the assignment to the right and the role to the left. Reveal only your expression. 

Secretly write down a gender identity, working with or against your slips. It can be anything: a picture, a noun, a normative assignment. Include pronouns.

Pick a situation: an interview, blind date, dinner party, etc.. Decide on roles within it. Set up a Jenga tower. Narrate your setting and actions, touching the tower when speaking in character. Hint at your identity without explicitly saying it. Whenever you use a pronoun or interact with a gendered expectation, remove a block and add it to the top of the tower. 

When the tower falls, collectively narrate an ending. Each player contributes one sentence at a time, concluding with a sentence from each player revealing their gender identity.
