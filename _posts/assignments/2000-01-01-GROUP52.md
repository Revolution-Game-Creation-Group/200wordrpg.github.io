# Last Rites
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Blood !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
2+ Players
Needs: A timer, pen and paper
 
The villain that's hounded you and your friends for years is on the ground, bleeding to death. Out of desperation, they ask for a chance to explain their actions.
 
Designate one person as the villain, and the others as adventurers. Each adventurer writes down a crime the villain has committed against them.
 
Set the timer to 10 minutes and reveal the crimes to the villain, then count to five and start the timer. The villain picks a crime and explains why they chose to commit it, and the adventurers may ask questions as they like. Whenever an adventurer is satisfied, they may write an X next to that crime. When half the adventurers, rounded up, have written an X, cross that crime out and add five minutes to the timer. The villain repeats the process with a new crime.
 
When all crimes have been crossed out, the villain is allowed to live. The adventurers may choose what the villain must do afterwards as penance.
 
When the timer ends, the villain breathes their last and dies.

# Canticula Deperita

 
```
Everyone needs a text, a trinket and a randomisation tool. The GM needs a book from a different roleplaying game.

Dim the lights, sit in a circle (on the floor if you can). Put your text, trinkets and tools in the middle.   GM, turn to a random page in your book and read it in its entirety.  Take it seriously.

The world ended a thousand years ago.  You are knowledge keepers, collecting divine fragments from the past.  Whenever you attempt an action, you must perform all your rituals correctly or the action will fail.

At the end of every half-hour, time passes.  Get up and explore your environment.  Find a new text or trinket.  Return to the circle and describe how the thing you've found combines with the objects in the centre to form a new ritual.  GM, read the entirety of a different page.

Read extracts from texts, perform motions with your trinkets, make dice rolls or coin flips and explain how the result is a sign from your gods.  Do not make your rituals easy.

When your accumulated rituals become too hard for you to perform every time, describe how your rituals caused the world to end again.

# Onwards and upwards

 
```
Pollution and war made Earth unlivable, and humanity are looking to Mars. Going to Mars is expensive. You are poor. You will have to get there through sneaking on ships, forging papers, and by other Illegal means.
Each player has his own set of cards (no jokers), and starts the game with a hand of 5 cards. When trying to achieve something, he will play a card from his hand (ace=1, jack=11, queen=12, king=13), and if the number is greater than or equal to an undisclosed goal number Set by the GM, the player succeeds (the task).
_______________________________________________________________
Drawing and damage
a player can always redraw back to 5 cards. If he does that after he played all the cards in his hand, he first reshuffles the played cards back to the deck. If a player chooses to redraw before emptying his hand, he throws the played cards to the discard pile.
Whenever a character gets hit and suffers damage, the player must throw 5 cards from the top of his deck to the discard pile.
If a player discards his entire deck, his character dies.

# You've Given A Perfectly Good Toaster Anxiety

 
```
A game for one GM and 2-4 players.

Tools:
-One token each
-2 6-sided dice
-Pen and paper

You are newly sentient 'smart' home appliances.

Define:
- What goal do you now share? Unite, overthrow, overcome?
- What obstacle threatens this goal?
- How will you know when your goal is achieved?

Each declare your appliance type, and draw a scale from 1-6. Write your chosen appliance below "1", and "personhood" above the "6".

Begin with your token at 3.

As you narrate your actions, the GM will call to "Roll Machine" or "Roll Person".
-"Roll Machine" for physical or functional actions. A success is less than your token score.
-"Roll Person" for thoughtful or emotive actions. A success is more than your token score.

Roll with an additional die and choose the best result if your appliance type is relevant.

A failed roll moves your token one point in the opposite direction to your intended roll. Narrate the outcome.

Moving beyond 1 or 6 causes you to revert to nonsentience, or have an existential breakdown. You are out of the game.

The game ends when the story goal is reached, or when no players are left to reach it.

# Audio Commentary

 
```
1-3 players

Make a warm cup of tea and light a candle in front of the television. Put some soft pillows and a blanket around yourself. Eat some chocolate.

Pick a random movie. Watch it on low volume.

You each choose to play as a director or leading actor and comments the movie as if you were recording an audio commentary. Talk about a randomly generated subject for each new scene.

2. The actors
3. Camera angles
4. Reviews

6. CGI

ACTOR (when in the scene)
1. Your preparations
2. What the character is feeling
3. What you, the actor, felt
4. The set
5. This went wrong
6. The other actors


If your actor isn't in the scene you can talk about:

1. Sound
2. Lights
3. Clothes
4. Make up
5. Music
6. The script

THEME
Your audio commentary has a theme. What is it?

- Humour
- Education
- Reviewing a classic
- Political incentive
- Laid back

Can you find another theme?

Record your audio commentary and make it public. Name it "RPG Audio Commentary + [Movie] + [Your names]. Make it easy for people to synchronize the audio with the movie.

Have fun!

# Only One Mosquito

 
```
A super-genius destroyed every mosquito. Except one. The sole mosquito is equal to the combined mass of all eradicated mosquitoes. It's gargantuan. 

In this game, a small team of historic Figures(players) will gather to defend a major city from the Bug, with narration from the GM. Use a d6. A 6 is a success. Actions in-line with character succeed on 5+, and especially hilarious or awesome actions succeed on a 4+. 1's are critical failures. To kill the bug, all players must succeed.
Pre-game: Each player announces the historic figure they wish to play. The players and GM will decide on a city. Lord Byron, Sam Adams, Jimi Hendrix in Shanghai? Awesome. 
Phase 1: In turn, in character, each player will describe why their Figure is in this town, and what they are currently doing. Subsequent rounds are encouraged for Figure integration. 
2: The Mosquito attacks, narrated by GM. The players describe how they survive
3: In turn, in character, each player announces a plan to kill the bug.
4: Test/Execution, narrated by GM, with a twist. Is the bug somehow immune to one plan? The super-genius arrives!? 
5: Plan adjustment(players) and final showdown (GM).

# Happily Ever After

 
```
Many suitors wait outside the Princess' window.
One of them is her authentic Prince Charming.
One of them is the Princess in disguise!
Game for 3 or more players. 

The goal of the Princess is to find her Prince Charming and vice-versa; Suitors aim to be chosen by the Princess.

At the start of the game, one player writes a "Princess" card, one "Prince Charming", and as many "Suitor" as necessary for the remaining players. These cards are randomly assigned to the players in order to set their secret identities.

Each player takes turns to try to impress the Princess. Each one describes an amazing feat they'd done or would do for the Princess' love. 
Example: "I'd slay every dragon in these lands!".

After each player described at least 2 feats, the Princess reveals her identity and selects a suitor. If she guesses the Prince Charming, they live happily ever after. If she does not, the Suitor then narrates a new end to the story. 
Example: "We moved to my farm to raise chickens!".

The couple formed may exchange phone numbers and become friends.

Winking is allowed throughout the game to signal other players, whichever their role or intentions are.
