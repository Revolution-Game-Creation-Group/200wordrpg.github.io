# Vintage Tweensona
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: nope !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are TWEENS. It is the 80s/early 90s. 
You have your current: gender, orientation, self-knowledge, acknowledgement of your mental and/or physical health conditions, and communication skills. Otherwise, you are TWEENS. 
This means you have tween-sized problems, such as quizzes, having to sneak home before curfew, and deciding how to spend your allowance. You do not have adult problems, such as politics or body image issues. If there are tween-sized problems you don't want to have, you don't have those either. 
You should wear 80s/early 90s clothing such as: overalls, corduroy, pastels, patterned leggings, acid-wash denim, ringer tees, body glitter, whatever. 
Do things like: go to an arcade, bowling, laser tag, watch cartoons, take Polaroids, play old-school RPGs, run around outside, eat junk food, plan to be best friends forever, read comics, roller skate, play freeze tag, play 3D Pinball Space Cadet, download an emulator and play old games, make prank calls, draw on your arms, bake cookies, build a secret hideout/blanket fort, get lost in the woods.   
Optional: whenever anyone asks you about your friendship, pretend you are childhood friends who have reconnected after a long time.

# Sword und Shotgun
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: (Probable) Violence !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are TRAVELERS, on a perilous journey to the PROMISED LANDS.

Divide nine points among the following stats: ATHLETICS, LORE, THIEVING, PERCEPTION, CONVERSE, MAGIC KEN, SURVIVAL, and SHOTGUN.

Name and describe your traveler. Each traveler starts with a sword and clothing.

Your traveler has eight COIN. One COIN buys:
* Bandages
* SHOTGUN points
* Tools (bonus points in a stat- describe)

The NARRATOR rolls 1d6 to determine an encounter.
1: Environmental hazard
2-3: Monster encounter
4-5: Hostile humans
6: Human civilization (Trade?)

To perform a task that has any risk, roll a d6 per point in a stat. Use the highest die:
6: You succeed!
4-5: You succeed, but at cost.
1-3: Bad stuff happens.

(0 points in a stat? Hail Mary! Roll a d6 and hope you get a 6, otherwise Bad Stuff happens!)

Instead of using a stat, you may spend SHOTGUN points and roll those to shoot a problem in the face. Spent SHOTGUN points are lost forever.

Some "bad stuff" may include losing gear, temporary stat penalties, or injuries. Four injuries and your traveler dies. SURVIVAL or bandages can remove injuries.

After ten journey legs, surviving travelers reach the PROMISED LANDS. Describe them!

# 216 Stitches

 
```
You are a seamstress. Or a weaver. Or a painter. You practice your craft with each item you create.

Set up your canvas with at least two colors to use. From a standard deck of cards, use only the 2s-10s. Shuffle the cards. Each card represents one item to craft. All items are crafted on the same canvas.

Each turn, draw one card. Stitch (or weave or paint) that number of times in one color to create the item. As you work, describe out loud why this item exists.

Suggested themes:
*Spade - An item for yourself
*Heart - A gift for another
*Club - A commissioned piece
*Diamond - An incomplete or abandoned item

Suggested descriptions:
*The item itself
*Why you're making it
*Any complications that arose during its creation
*Who it's for
*The time of year

After an item is completed, change to a different color and start a new turn. Play until all cards are drawn or when you've created enough items.

Possible variations:
*Different color per suit
*Different stitch/design per item
*Create items that overlap each other
*Card numbers indicate the complexity of the item, descriptively and/or literally

# Waiting for Godot, the Role-Playing Game

 
```
One player says: "Nothing to be done." This begins the scene. All players may then respond with whatever lines they would like from the following list, whenever they would like. They may not say anything not on the list. 

Ah!
Off we go.
Am I?
Over there.
And so on.
Possibly.
And what of it?
Shall we go?
Ask him.
Silence!
Carry on.
So he says.
Farewell.
There's nothing to do.
Help me!
True.
I don't know.
We can't.
I must go.
Well?
I'm going.
What for?
I'm tired.
What is it?
It hurts.
What?
Me, too.
Where?
No.
Who?
Not at all!
Why not?
Not now, not now.
Why?
Not so loud!
Yes.
Nothing.
You think so?

Players may start outside of the scene, entering at their leisure. Players may leave the scene whenever they would like. At some point, a player will say, "Yes, let's go." At this point, all players should be silent for a few moments, and the game is over.

# Juxtaposeurs

 
```
Assemble 3+ players.  Together, pick a fictional intellectual property that everyone knows.  

Individually, choose one iconic historical photograph (the flag-raising at Iwo Jima, for example) and two visual depictions of easily recognizable in-universe things from the chosen IP (concept art, screenshots, still frames).  Using an image editor, insert the latter into the photograph in any way you choose.  Print the result.  

Voila!  You're now SOPHISTOS, erudite denizens of Meta--a realm that is a fusion of our world and the IP--and hoo-boy, you have LOADS to say about the significance of your particular images.  Take turns presenting them.  What do they depict?  Why are they iconic on Meta?  How did each "define a generation?"  Lean into allegory.  Build on each other's details.  Be verbose.  Be pretentious.  Be "too beaucoup."  

Debate, ramble indefinitely, but don't laugh.  Ever.  Art is fucking serious.  

Anyone who breaks character or chortles is summarily demoted to PHILISTINE status.  Philistines are rubes, unfit to discuss high culture.  They ignorantly point out how goofy Sophistos sound discussing old pictures.  Philistines jeer, making crude jokes until they drag Sophistos down to their level.

When the last Sophisto succumbs (or when the last Philistine falls asleep), destroy the images.

# Queer Eyes on Stalks
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Death (in the context of wholesome family show Queer Eye which probably makes it worse) !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
(For 3+ players.)

One person plays an arrogant and paranoid Beholder who feels a bit stuck in life and is ready to accept positive change through a make-over TV-show.

They decide some things about the beholder, which are known to the other players at the start of the game.

Name
Who nominated you
An event that's coming up that you're preparing for

Secretly, decided the following:

Something touchy you'd kill someone for mentioning
Most dangerous part of lair
One positive personal connection
The individual effects of your ten eye rays


Everyone else makes an adventurer:

Name
Class (such as wizard, food and wine expert, personal trainer, therapist, bard, stylist, etc.)
Why you naively think you have a good chance of making it out alive


Create short scenes between one adventurer and the beholder. The other players play producers (and minor characters) and decide what's the premise for each scene before it begins.

After each adventurer who is still alive has had four scenes with the beholder. Narrate the event and how the beholder has changed.

Everyone separately writes down what the lesson learnt was. Judge your success on how close / coherent your answers were.

# Quest Giver

 
```
The game is played over several rounds, each time a different player is the Employer, the rest Adventurers.

1) APPLICANTS:
In secret, each Adventurer writes a description of a character from any genre, eg:
	Paladin of the Luck God
	Ex-Military Robot Butler
	French Archeologist from 1924

Randomly assign these, ensuring nobody receives their own. Do not reveal them yet.

2) PITCH:
The Employer outlines a Quest, eg:
	Find a stolen spacestation
	Kidnap a dragon
	Become Mayor of London

3) INTERVIEW:
Adventurers announce who they are and attempt to convince the Employer to hire them. When ready, the Employer chooses a single Adventurer who receives 1 point.

4) OPTIONAL QUEST STAGE:
Starting on the Employer's left, each player except the chosen Adventurer:
	a) Describes a problem on the quest
	b) Adventurer says how they solve it
	c) Players who like the solution give the Adventurer 1D6
	d) Adventurer rolls those plus one additional D6
	e) Rolling at least one 5 or 6 beats the problem: Adventurer and Employer both receive 1 point
		
5) Play a new round, until everyone has been the Employer.


 The player with the most points wins, if you like that sort of thing.
