# Vintage Tweensona
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: nope !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You are TWEENS. It is the 80s/early 90s. 
You have your current: gender, orientation, self-knowledge, acknowledgement of your mental and/or physical health conditions, and communication skills. Otherwise, you are TWEENS. 
This means you have tween-sized problems, such as quizzes, having to sneak home before curfew, and deciding how to spend your allowance. You do not have adult problems, such as politics or body image issues. If there are tween-sized problems you don't want to have, you don't have those either. 
You should wear 80s/early 90s clothing such as: overalls, corduroy, pastels, patterned leggings, acid-wash denim, ringer tees, body glitter, whatever. 
Do things like: go to an arcade, bowling, laser tag, watch cartoons, take Polaroids, play old-school RPGs, run around outside, eat junk food, plan to be best friends forever, read comics, roller skate, play freeze tag, play 3D Pinball Space Cadet, download an emulator and play old games, make prank calls, draw on your arms, bake cookies, build a secret hideout/blanket fort, get lost in the woods.   
Optional: whenever anyone asks you about your friendship, pretend you are childhood friends who have reconnected after a long time.

# An Odd Little Town

 
```
Basic Premise
This game is played with a GM, 2-6 players, and a handful of six-sided dice. Players are citizens of a small town in the middle of nowhere. Establish how they all know each other. Strange things are beginning to happen in town, and they are going to be tangled up in it.

Inciting Incident
1 Murder
2 Disappearance
3 Appearance
4 Sighting
5 Strange Behavior
6 Dreams

Resolving Uncertainty
When a player takes action, and the result is unclear, they roll a die. They can get extra dice in a few ways:

-Possess a significant advantage
-Work together with others
-Trigger a new Oddity

Take the highest die, and interpret the results:
1-3: No, And (Failure, things get worse.)
4: No, But (Failure, a bright side.)
5: Yes, But (Success, with a catch.)
6: Yes, And (Success, things get better.)

Oddities
Endless hallways. Strange creatures in the woods. Creepy strangers on the side of the road. As the players dig up the secrets of their town, reality unravels, and the world becomes more like a dream, or a nightmare. Some are innocuous new neighbors, some are deadly monsters. Oddities are permanent, they will snowball over time.

# Grumpy Neighborhood

 
```
This is a game without the common Game Master where all the participants take on the role of an elderly person living in a quiet neighborhood.
All the players are neighbors and they all face the same threat: the annoying kids that keep moving in with their loud music and over-the-top shenanigans.
The game begins with the oldest member in the group stating what kind of erratic behavior the kids are conducting and sets a difficulty of 1 to 6. Then the next player (clockwise) says how he/she will kick them out, rolling a 6 sided die and succeeding if the roll meets or exceeds the difficulty. If the roll is lower, the kids remain, calling their friends and increasing the base difficulty by 1.
Once all the players have had a turn, the difficulty can't get lower than 5, since the kids will be starting their new best party of the year.
More than ever, the neighbors must work together! Each player states their part on the great plan and in the end they all roll. On a 5 or higher, they manage to kick the kids of their neighborhood, returning to their peaceful lives!

# Arté Sophisphicateurs' Societé

 
```
Salut! The players are fellow-members of Arté Sophisphicateurs' Societé, whose raison d'être is to be the most vociferous critic in their clique.

Dress artsy-fartsy. Most stylish fellow gets a beret. Each fellow prepares 3 sheets of paper and a pen. Bring extra sheets of paper. Then, visit a gallery/museum!

Beret fellow chooses the first art piece to contemplate. Everyone secretly writes one adjective describing the art piece per sheet of paper they have. After a comfortable while, Beret fellow asks one fellow a question about the piece, who answers and asks another fellow (no asking back!). Repeat ad nauseam.

If another fellow mentions an adjective you have, reveal and strike-out that adjective, preferably with a snooty remark like "How hoi polloi of you!". If no one else has your adjective, tear a tiny piece of paper from the offending fellow . Mentioning your own adjective is a faux-pas.

After 8 minutes or when someone runs out of adjectives, the fellow with most torn paper pieces gets the beret + an additional sheet of paper and chooses the next art piece to appreciate. Repeat until ennui sets in.

Fellow with most torn paper pieces "wins" but everyone thinks they're nonpareil critics anyway.

# Takes two to tango

 
```
You are the fire brigade planning a rescue action. 
Tasks: 
- Putout fire. 
- Move to floor above.
You need to successfully pass max levels you can without errors. 

Before a round starts players should write down 2 items on 2 cards.
Mix all to deck. Pull 2 cards to your hand. You'll take these items to mission. 

Try to write funny words and then correctly explain it by acting a role of firefighter in trouble! 
For example: you got word "GOAT". 
You think 5 seconds and say "I milk the goat and putout fire". 
You did it! Task One solved. 
Now you need move to another floor (Task Two). 
You pulled "GASOLINE" word. Using your brain you can say "I fill jet pack with gasoline and soar to next floor". 
Good job. Pass turn to next player. 

Gameplay subtlety is to come up with not simple things for FIRE PROBLEM / MOVING ON FLOOR. 
If an item appears more than ones - you can't use it. Game chain will be stopped. Do not use "extinguisher" and "ladder" often then. 

Replay rounds and try to score 30 floors and more! And then get another setting: Farmers (Garden / Manufacture), Bandits (Crime / Chasing) Hospital, Espionage, etc.

# ConjuRat

 
```
He's the talentless son of a legendary wizard. You are a rat skilled in the arcane arts. When you first met, you immediately recognized the significance of your pairing, and teamed up to collaboratively become the greatest mage ever.
As a rat, you cannot be seen performing magic or else you will be killed or worse. As the son of a legendary wizard, he cannot be exposed as a failure or else he will be ostracized. You found a solution. You hide under his hat and guide his actions, either whispering in his ear or pulling his hair to steer him, and he keeps your presence a secret. Together, you appear to be a single, powerful wizard. But how long can the charade last?

# OH NO, IT'S GAY!
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: romance & sexuality !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
OH NO, IT'S GAY!
a game for two or more

You are gay. They are cute.
It's a problem, for some reason. Decide why.

You each have a pile of six-sided dice.
Each player's dice should be of a single unique color.

RULES FOR TWO OR THREE:
Start flirting. Maybe you're roleplaying. Maybe it's real life. Who knows.
When a player's flirting has its intended effect on you, stack one of your dice. All dice are stacked in the center of the table in a single column, each player adding their own on top of the others. Be careful ... or don't?
When the dice stack falls, the last to add a die must confess their feelings to the other player(s), who may of course react however they like.

RULES FOR MORE THAN THREE:
Each player keeps their own stack of dice.
Each player still has their own color, but when a player flirts successfully, one of their dice is taken and added to that player's stack. When a stack falls, the player must confess their feelings to either the person who had the most dice in the fallen stack, or to the person whose die was added last.
