# The Boys
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: alcohol consumption !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You call yourselves the Boys, a gaggle of petty and absurd stepdads. You're about to fuck everything up again.

Get a Pool Table set up for Snooker. Ideally you suck at it. Dim the lights and drink some beers. Each player picks a hole for themselves and comes up with a dumb nickname.

One of the boys has a genius scheme. He makes the break.

Rotating around the left, each player narrates what their character will do, and makes a snooker shot at a red ball. If a ball goes in to a hole, they get another turn and can target colored balls.

If a red ball goes in a player's hole, that player narrates how that action fucked them over.

If a colored ball goes into a hole, that hole's associated player has his cravings and grudges sated. Say how.

If a player hits a foul, something bad happens to them instead of anyone else.

The game ends when the black is sunk. The player who took the shot miraculously escapes whatever consequences the boy's night out created. Every other player narrates their Boy's final fate until next time.

# Gander Reveal Party

 
```
Players: 8-20

Time: 30 minutes 

-Supplies: Name tags

-Theme: You were invited by someone to their "Gander Reveal Party" and assumed it was a typo, until your friend introduced their goose.

-Safety: Cut and Brake.  Players should set limits on Goose behavior.

-Characters: 

*Host*: Host loves everyone at the party and wants them to share their excitement.

*Goose*: Goose hates everyone.  Goose runs around, attacks people, honks, and knocks stuff over. If Host says, "Bad Goose," Goose should act worse.  If Host says "be a good goose," Goose should calm down, but still be bad.

*Friends and family*: You're here to be excited about a new baby.

-Character Creation:

Stand in a circle.  Introduce yourselves, say why you dislike the person to your right. Host likes everyone, Goose likes no one. Do Name Tags.


-Gameplay:

The party starts with Host welcoming everyone and then making a quick exit.  Give people a few minutes before returning and then call for attention.  Say you know why you're all here and then introduce Goose.  Let Goose loose in the room. Use Goose mechanics to help modulate Goose player.  The game ends when Host kicks everyone out of their house.

# Answers to Job

 
```
A game for two players: 

God - The Great Author, The Mover Unmoved. What world have you created?

Job - A person, not at ease. They have no rest, but trouble comes. How has God wronged you?


Job briefly lists God's crimes, ending: "I would speak to the Almighty, for I desire to reason with God."

God then describes the terrible form in which They appear to Job - a fire, a whirlwind, a still quiet voice. They command "Who is this that demands counsel, with words without knowledge?"


Then, God and Job play a game of Questions, Job demanding answers, and God presenting mysteries.  Each player may only speak in questions - if they make any other sort of utterance, or are struck speechless, they must flip a coin. Whenever Job flips tails, their resolve to question God is worn down. Whenever God flips tails, their aegis of mystery is eroded, a little bit. If either player gets five tails, they must concede defeat - Job must recant, contented that they are dust, or God must confess the Mysteries of Creation.


After someone concedes, narrate:

God - How do you reward Job?

Job - How do you live out the rest of your days in peace?

# Last goodbye
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Infection, desease, death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You've been infected and in a few hours you could either turn into something or die.

Take a piece of paper, this is your last diary.
Take a pen and write 2 or 3 short sentences about what happened.
What infected you and how? How do you feel about it?
Fold the diary and put it in your pocket. 

During the next few hours whenever you take a break (coffee, lunch, toilet, etc.), remember your diary.
Find a pen and add a detail by writing 2 more sentences.
Choose from:
- Were you with someone? Where were you?
- How did you react? What were your thoughts?
- What were you doing when this happened?
- Did you try to hide or cure the infection?

The longer the day goes on, your writing becomes illegible due to infection getting worse.
In order:
- You'll not be able to use punctuation.
- Only verbs, nouns and adjectives.
- You'll confuse the words and no longer write them in order.
- Use only a few letters of every words.

When you have written the 4 details the game ends and you will no longer be human.
Scrawl now the last words to say goodbye to someone.

# The Unspeakable Wisdom

 
```
Take tokens, this game, post-its, 6 friends.

*************************************STORY*************************************

Go to a library. As you enter-- be quiet! 
You are in 1988. No internet, no computers.

This rules are the Dead Scrolls, written in a complex eldritch language. You were asked to translate them.

*************************************RULES*************************************

Each of you is an eminence in 2 disciplinary different fields: physics, literature, biology... Get a token for each fringe discipline you choose. 

You cannot talk to each other since you live in different countries. To translate, ask yourself something about the Story/Rules, then read books of your fields. When you find the same noun/verb in 7 different books, write it on a post-it: that's a piece of the translation. 

Send letters to the other researchers; if someone replays to you and guesses one of your words, get a token. 

If you speak/write one of your words, lose a token; with none, you lose your mind. 

The first to reach 7 words/tokens reunite all players and get help on the translation: mix up the post-it to create a phrase. Anyone may spend a token to add 3 to 5 new words. 
Use the phrase to expand the Story/the Rules.
