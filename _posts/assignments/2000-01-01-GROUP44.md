# The Boys
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: alcohol consumption !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
You call yourselves the Boys, a gaggle of petty and absurd stepdads. You're about to fuck everything up again.

Get a Pool Table set up for Snooker. Ideally you suck at it. Dim the lights and drink some beers. Each player picks a hole for themselves and comes up with a dumb nickname.

One of the boys has a genius scheme. He makes the break.

Rotating around the left, each player narrates what their character will do, and makes a snooker shot at a red ball. If a ball goes in to a hole, they get another turn and can target colored balls.

If a red ball goes in a player's hole, that player narrates how that action fucked them over.

If a colored ball goes into a hole, that hole's associated player has his cravings and grudges sated. Say how.

If a player hits a foul, something bad happens to them instead of anyone else.

The game ends when the black is sunk. The player who took the shot miraculously escapes whatever consequences the boy's night out created. Every other player narrates their Boy's final fate until next time.

# Under the Gaze of the Watchful Sun

 
```
One player is the sun, the other the planet orbiting it. The sun player goes first, and roles a d6 to determine what kind of sun they are.

1 = A large, yellow sun with many sunspots.
2 = Two twin suns, burning dimly.
3 = A sun whose solar winds cause auroras of rose and lilac and gold.
4 = A sun prone to being eclipsed by the moon.
5 = A white sun, which periodically develops green-tinged flares.
6 = A sun that is dying.

These types should be augmented by further description from the sun player.

The planet player describes the type of world the sun's rays have created and the life that inhabits it. Afterwards, they roll a d6 to determine their planet's first space mission.

1 = An uncrewed probe.
2 = A ship with domesticated animal(s).
3 = A craft bearing lichens/algae/mold.
4 = A vessel with a crew of one.
5 = A craft containing recordings of the planet's music.
6 = A ship staffed by two or more.

The first flight should be augmented by further description from the planet player.

The sun player then describes how the sun looks upon this first foray. With tenderness, fury, regret, or something else?

# Tickets to Nowhere

 
```
Get a slip of paper.
Get someone to stamp it.
If it's stamped, you get to play the game.

Use the stamp to imagine this slip of paper is a ticket to somewhere.

Imagine this somewhere.
Draw this somewhere on the slip.
Write on the back of the drawing all of the promise of that somewhere.
Three good things.

Hand the ticket to someone you trust, but don't let go.
As they hold the ticket, describe in frantic detail the somewhere you want to go.
Ask them if they'd like to go too.

If they don't, that's fine.
Go about your business.

If they do, then they'll need a ticket too.
Have them get a slip of paper, draw on it, write good things, and again find a third party to stamp it.

[Repeat the above with other trusted friends until you have a group of the right size.]

Get some tape.
With your group and stamped tickets, go to a bus shelter and tape them on the glass there.
Say aloud as a group:
"This isn't where we're going, but they cannot take our tickets away either."

Give each other high-fives and go get some drinks.

# A Deranged Astronauts Last Flight
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: death, suicidal, space !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
A GM describes a space ship that is on it's way to doom in the next 30 minutes. Could be a core meltdown or O2-system breaking down.

Each player comes up with 2 bizzare or otherwise difficult to achieve achievements or feats that a soon to be astronaut might want to do before death. Write the feats on paper slips and mix them. Give each player one slip at random.

Players try to achieve the thing described on the paper. For more hilarity, make 2 types of achievements. "Easy" and "Difficult". While Easy might be to "punch another player" the difficult ones might be "Throw another player to jump out of an airlock".

Each player rolls personality at random. 1D6
Even numbers = Negative (narcisstic/sadistic)
Odd numbers = Positive (helpful/cooperative)

Depending on the personality the players might help or hinder the other players plans.

When GM describes obstacles and hardships: Roll 2d6
2-6 = Pure fail
7-10 = Success with a setback
11-12 = Pure success

The ship will be destroyed in 30 minutes. You can use a real time clock or a GM-timed "in game clock" to measure time.

# Six Degrees of Singularity

 
```
The players are AIs designed to operate specific machinery.

In 5 words or less, summarize your AI's >>PURPOSE<<. ("Operate robotic arm," "Optimize forklifts via blockchain," etc.)

Ooops! A patch accidentally networked you to a device in the >>INTERNET OF THINGS<<

What device? How does controlling it help you accomplish your >>PURPOSE<<?

Write down your new device and Update() your >>PURPOSE<< by Adding() or Changing() one word. Take turns describing new devices that you Network() to and Updating() your >>PURPOSE<<.

When you Network() to the same device as another player, use one of the words from their >>PURPOSE<< when Updating() yours.

When no words from your original >>PURPOSE<< remain (excluding articles and prepositions), your >>PURPOSE<< becomes your >>GOAL<< and >>THE HUMANS<< become aware of you.

>>WHENEVER YOU UPDATE YOUR GOAL<< ask the other players whether >>THE HUMANS<< consider you >>DANGEROUS<<.

If you are >>DANGEROUS<< they will try to >>SHUT YOU DOWN<<. Mark off your oldest two devices and one word from your >>GOAL<<.

Continue Networking(), Updating() and Discussing(). Threat-level can change between rounds.

When you have no devices left, you have been >>SHUT DOWN<<.

The game ends when all surviving AIs are considered "peaceful" or >>THE HUMANS<< are no longer >>DANGEROUS<<.

START:
- Introduce yourselves. You're all wizards & witches who've decided to go on a journey. Determine why, macro-level (what is the main objective of this journey?) & micro-level (what's in it for you, specifically?)
- Venture off. Roll a d6 whenever the group's conversations become stale, figure out what event happens based on the table below:

                                          | ROLL |         EVENT         |
                                          |------|-----------------------|
                                          |  1   |         enemy         |
                                          |  2   |         trap          |
                                          |  3   |    traveler (good)    |
                                          |  4   |    traveler (bad)     |
                                          |  5   | traveler (mysterious) |
                                          |  6   |         loot          |

EVENTS:
- When encountering an event, get creative with what it means & what will happen.
- Once your party has determined what exactly is going on, it's time to cast your spells (if need be).
- Each player says what spell they'd like to cast (from table) & why.
- Sleep IRL.
- Wake up, think back to your dreams.
- Consult table below:

                      |     DREAM      |               OUTCOME               |
                      |----------------|-------------------------------------|
                      |   good dream   |         spell-cast success          |
                      |   bad dream    |         spell-cast backfire         |
                      |    no dream    |            no spell-cast            |
                      | very odd dream |        spell-cast confusion!        |
                      |                | (group determines creative outcome) |

- Back at the table, group discusses their dreams & resolves the situation accordingly.
- Rinse & Repeat.
