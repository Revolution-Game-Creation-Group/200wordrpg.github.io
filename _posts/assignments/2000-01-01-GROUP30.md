# Après Moi Le Déluge

 
```
You represent a festering establishment. Like Icarus chasing the sun, you carry your people to their imminent and completely evitable demise.

Build a Jenga tower at the center of the table. You will destabilize this Regime, your people's tomorrow, for the sake of your own today. Consider Versailles, Babel, Krypton, Atlantis, environmental policy.

Describe your broad Domain, individual Titles, and decadent Vices. Take turns narrating and governing selfishly, or rule alone.

Whenever you:
...*Underestimate Suffering* or *Belittle Your Advisers*, pull a brick from the Regime. Place it in the Treasury.
...*Boast of Your Vision* or *Revel In Luxury*, construct Vanity Projects around the Regime's foundation using the Treasury. Build palaces, armies, idols, gardens. Dream of a legacy.

If a Vanity Project falls, blame it on a factor outside your control. Then, place its bricks atop the Regime.

When the Regime falls, the future you refused to see is now the present. Narrate how it all goes wrong. The game is over.

At any time, your dynasty can step down and hand power to someone more capable. Briefly narrate how they will be a force for good, then place one hand on the doomed Regime and shove it over. See above.

# Escape from Translucidia

 
```
Three scavengers must cross a nightmarish city to bring supplies back to their colony. They will face perils from without and within.

Each player has 10 check-boxes representing supplies.

On your turn, roll 2d10. Describe a scene for the other two, using indicated prompts:

  ( WITHIN )                   ( WITHOUT )
1. CONFESSION             DARKNESS
2. BETRAYAL                  HEIGHT
3. SACRIFICE                  DEPTH
4. PHOBIA                       REFLECTION
5. MEMORY                     HUNTING
6. SECRET                       TRAP
7. EPIPHANY                   ILLUSION
8. LIE                                SPEED
9. TRUTH                         NOISE
10. INSECURITY             SILENCE      

Cross off prompts when used. If re-rolled, use the next.

In a scene, take turns building on what's described. When peril is imminent, each roll 1d10, and collaboratively resolve the scene using indicated prompts:

1-3: You lose some supplies. Mark off one check-box. If you have none, check another player's.

4-6: You are impaired, but you carry on.

7-9: You narrowly escape the peril.

10: You discover additional supplies. Add a new check-box.

When 9 of each scene prompts have been crossed off, you return to the colony.

Roll 1d10, add remaining supplies, and collaboratively epilogue:

30+: The colony will thrive.
20-30: The colony will survive.
10-20: Not everyone will survive.
<10: The colony will collapse.

# Finding A Thief

 
```
One player is a dwarf. Write your name and the treasure your people lost which you hope to recover.

All other players are halflings. Write your name and your favorite food, the more elaborate the better (keep it secret).

Going around, the dwarf attempts to persuade a halfling to join their quest by addressing them by name and offering them a specific food. Halflings eat the food, thank the dwarf by name, and comment that it "needs more [ingredient from their favorite food]".

When the dwarf offers a halfling exactly their favorite food, they will agree to be a thief for the dwarf. Both win a share of the treasure.

The other halflings win because they got a bunch of free food, and don't have to go on a perilous adventure far from home.

# Electric Hearts

 
```
All the Humans are gone. The circumstances of their extinction do not matter. It was so long ago, the world has stopped caring. Nature reclaimed the cities, and Animals roam the new wilderness. It is peaceful, but lonely.

You are a ROBOT, one of the few remaining creations of the Humans. 
You start with PROGRAMMING 3 and FEELINGS 1

They made you for a specific purpose your binary code still compels you to accomplish. When acting according to your programming, flip coins equal to your PROGRAMMING. If any Heads, you are successful. If exactly one Heads, increase your PROGRAMMING by one, or decrease FEELINGS by one.
There are others like you. You learn from them, and as a result have started to develop emotions similar to those the Humans displayed. When acting emotionally, roll d6s equal to your FEELINGS. If fives or sixes, you are successful. If any doubles, increase your FEELINGS by one or decrease your PROGRAMMING by one. If you succeed with no fives, increase someone else's FEELINGS by one.

At PROGRAMMING 5, you have become a soulless, perfect machine.
At FEELINGS 5, you have become all but human; flawed and imperfect, but able to feel true love.

# Hitman
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: "Assassinations" "Poisons" !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The Hitman is a dangerous assassin that kills their target no matter what. Tonight is a dinner party, there are a lot of guests but two of them are marked for assassination. The guests know ahead of time that the Hitman is coming but they don't know who are the targets. They must find out who is the Hitman and stop him before he'll assassinate both targets.

There would be rooms and all players would be randomly assigned by dice to different rooms each turn. Each room will vote on whether they should kill someone inside or not, and who. Resolve voting stalemates using dice. After the first turn, a card is left in each room. These cards are clues guests can choose to pick up. If the guests collect enough cards, they unveil the Hitman's identity and win. However, the Hitman can lace a card in the same room as him with a deadly poison. Any guest that picks up the poisoned card immediately dies. Only one card can be poisoned at a time, and it stays there until another card has been poisoned.

# Homunculi - Tiny Servants of Evil

 
```
You are homunculi, tiny human facsimiles possessed by dead spirits. You carry out evil deeds of dark magic for your master. You have some faint memories of being human.

Shuffle a pack of cards and draw five each. These represent your memories.

Oldest player starts.

Turn sequence:
- Reveal the top card of the deck. This is the task. 
- Going clockwise players reveal a memory, in suit if possible.
  All memories in suit: highest performs the task. 
  Non-suit memories: lowest non-suit performs the task.
- Resolution:
  Memory higher than task: A good memory, reinforced (place task under memory). While reinforced it cannot be lost. 
  Memory equal or lower: A bad memory, discard it.
  Memory not in suit: A bad memory, discard it and choose:
    - Discard a reinforcement or another memory
    or
    - Give a reinforced memory to another homunculus (explain why it was theirs all along)
- Describe the task and the memories.
- Put discards in pile for reshuffle.
- Active player draws another task to start the next turn.

Game ends when either:
One homunculus reinforces all remaining memories: they break free and escape from the master.
One homunculus loses all their memories: they become a mindless servant of evil, destroying the others.
