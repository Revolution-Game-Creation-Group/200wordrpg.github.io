# Animals Are People Too

 
```
Animals Are People Too

You are animals.
You are constantly being mistake for human.
You are forced to live Human lives.
Deal with it.

Players:
Give yourself a name, 4 descriptive words about you, a human desire, and your living situations.

For any contest or check consult the table below.

Result rolled:
1 - You're screwed.
2 - It's better than you expected.
3 - Everything's not fine
4 - Everything's fine*
5  - It's worse that you  expected.
6  - You're golden.

What it means:
Everything's fine - It worked the way you wanted it.
Everything's not fine -  It didn't work the way you wanted it.
It's better than you expected - It worked the way you wanted it but better.
It's worse than you expected - It didn't work and may have consequences.
You're golden - It worked out amazingly great!
You're screwed - It failed down right disastrously.

Did someone realize you're an animal when you rolled a 1?

1 - Yes						
2-6 - No			          

Game Master:
Put them in everyday Human situations.
Give them an adversary, or multiple, maybe.
Script a sitcom.

# My Lunch with Senator Andre

 
```
Premise:
It's time to eat. You want to go somewhere, but you are also with a group. If you admit you only want Baja Blast they may think less of you, so it's time to lie and connive and make them think they decided on getting that sweet sweet blue liquid. 

Don't ever admit what you really want.

Don't ever make compromises.

PREPARATION:
Write down 3 aspects of the restaurant you want to go to:
one foodstuff such as "serves hummus"
one aesthetic  such as" goofy shit on the walls"
one vibe such as "awkwardly horny"

Keep 2, and put the other in a hat. Everyone playing will draw another aspect from the hat. 

Now write what you consider the antithesis of the restaurant you want to go to. Horny Hardee's, for example, is the antithesis of chaste Red Lobster. This is your Veto card.

VOTING:
A vote must be proposed and seconded before voting starts.

A majority vote will end the game unless it gets hit with a Veto card.

CONCLUSION:
If you don't get everything you have ever wanted; you lose. 

You have 10 minutes. Agree on lunch or you must go to Taco Bell

# (don't) fight Suzanne: an autobiog-rpg

 
```
Sit in a circle. We each play an expert fighter, and each take turns playing Suzanne. Choose your expert's area of martial expertise, or roll a d6 on the list below:
     1. Jiu-jitsu
     2. Capoeira
     3. Krav Maga
     4. Muay Thai
     5. Taekwondo
     6. Bare-knuckle boxing

Decide who will be Suzanne first. Suzanne attempts to challenge the expert to her left to a fight. Suzanne is an ordinary, small-ish and not particularly strong or coordinated woman. If the fight occurs, Suzanne will definitely be knocked out, and almost no one wants that. 

-Expert Fighters: Try to talk Suzanne out of fighting you, by whatever means you see fit: reasoning with her, convincing her to fight someone else, demonstrating your superior martial prowess in indirect ways, distracting her, etc. 

-Suzanne: You can probably take any of these chumps. It would probably be fun. Try to convince the expert to your left to fight, just for the hell of it.

After two minutes, or Suzanne is convinced to move on, play passes left; the last fighter becomes the new Suzanne, and challenges the expert on her left. Play until everyone has been Suzanne, or Suzanne has been knocked out.

# Hegemon
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Despotism, Imperialism !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Players are DESPOTS of their own empire. DESPOTS have three ATTRIBUTES: ECONOMY, MILITARY, ESPIONAGE.

===== Setup =====
How did you rise to power? Assign values of 2, 1, and 0 to your ATTRIBUTES, in any order.
Why do you fear the DESPOT to your right? Assign +1 to one of their ATTRIBUTES.
Why do you envy the DESPOT to your left? Assign +1 to one of their ATTRIBUTES.

===== Start of ROUND =====
Gain INFLUENCE = 7 + total ATTRIBUTES.

Each player creates a NATION with RESISTANCE = d6. Describe geopolitical significance and ATTRIBUTE needed to subjugate.

NATION(s) with highest RESISTANCE are INDEPENDENT.

Secretly bid INFLUENCE to subjugate each remaining non-INDEPENDENT NATION in order from least to greatest RESISTANCE (randomly resolve ties).
    STRENGTH = ATTRIBUTE + INFLUENCE bid + d6
Highest STRENGTH that exceeds RESISTANCE subjugates NATION and gains +1 to that ATTRIBUTE. If tied or no bid exceeds RESISTANCE, NATION becomes INDEPENDENT. Bid INFLUENCE is always spent.

Diplomacy is encouraged but never binding.

After all subjugation is resolved, roll d6 and spend that much INFLUENCE or citizens REVOLT: set one ATTRIBUTE of your choice to 0, permanently. Any other DESPOT may spend 3 INFLUENCE, describe meddling, and choose the ATTRIBUTE for you.

Repeat ROUNDs until megalomania is satisfied.

# The Icebox

 
```
The Time Police have arrested many criminals and war heroes from across the multiverse, and due to corruption behind the scenes, these people are forced to fight each other in Intergalactic Party World's arena, the ICEbox, in a game show called the Intergalactic Combat Environment.

Players form a team of inmates from across the multiverse, and try to survive their matches while trying to find a way off of Intergalactic Party World.

Players choose 4 skills of their choice, and assigns each a value. 
One of these skills at +3, one at +2, and two at +1. 
These are called your "Character's Skills" and can be anything from Guitar Solos to Pilot Aircraft.

Players then choose between Melee, Ranged, and Magic, and gives themselves a +2 in that skill. 

Players get any two items of their choice that are used with their skills. One item gives a +3 to a skill of your choice, and the other gives a +2 to a different skill.

Skills are performed with D6s equal to your skill rating against a difficulty set by the DM. A difficulty 10 is difficult for someone with a 2 skill, and easy for someone with a 5 skill.

# The Liminal Hotel Guest Book

 
```
In an empty notebook, write:

To slip into the hotel at the seam of the real, hold this book closed in your hands while you lay down to sleep. Listen for the chatter of the hotel's liminal attendants as they roll precarious push-carts down the hall. When their aether voices ring true in your ears, open the book to see the hotel room that they have made for you, cluttered with objects bizarre and mundane.

If this is your first time holding this guest book, write down three things you see, feel, and hear. If this is a return visit, notice that your room is different now. Write what things the attendants have taken from your room, and what new things are here, perhaps visiting from another guest's room.

Some of what you write must be real. 
All of it must be true.

Sign and date your entry however you like. Sleep, and listen to the murmurs of the attendants for truths, material or imagined. When you wake, you'll find yourself returned to your bed.

When you meet the next guest of the hotel (you will know), hand this book to them and tell them to read it alone.

# Menu Quest

 
```
You're in a restaurant, with a menu and dice in front of you. Time for adventure!

One player is the gamemaster; the others create characters based on menu items.

~Setting~

Collectively choose a setting for your quest, inspired by the venue itself. Horror story with evil clowns? Wild animal encounters in the Outback? Fantasy adventure in the faerie cupcake kingdom?

~Character Creation~

Players: Choose a menu item to represent your character. Your action die is the one closest in value to (but not lower than) your item's price in dollars. (For items higher than $20, add the digits.) A lower die succeeds more often, but a higher die has a greater effect.

Use your menu item to also give your character a name and description.

Example: Reuben is Swiss with a rye sense of humor and a d10 action die.

~Adversaries~

GM: Choose some adversaries, each based on a menu item, with the price as their strength.

Now the group describes their journey, with the GM presenting adversaries. Each player attempts to defeat the adversary with their action die; an action is successful only if the highest number on the die comes up, reducing the adversary's strength by that number.
