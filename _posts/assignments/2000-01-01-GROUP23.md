# One Shot, One Kill
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: murder !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Target: Codename Mr. White
Estimated Net Worth: $12,000,000,000
Occupation: Philanthropist
Silent donor with high spending on security, privacy, PR.
DoB: Today (year unknown)
Infiltrate party on floor 10 of the Grand Park Hotel; retrieve (1) standard 9mm handgun and (1) untraceable bullet; eliminate target.
Standard Agency Non-ID Protocol

Things that are true: 
* You are contractors working together to complete this job.
* You have never met before tonight.
* You have never heard of Mr. White before tonight.

To make a character: Tell everyone what they look like, what we should call them, and how we should refer to them.

When you try to do something specialized, make a skill check.
* Basic tasks don't require checks, even if they're a little bit hard.
* Checks don't allow you to attempt the wildly improbable.

To make a skill check:
If you have a skill that covers it, you automatically succeed.
If you don't, flip a coin. On heads, you succeed. If you succeed and no one else has a skill for this kind of thing already, write down a name for your new skill.
Whether you succeed or fail, flip again. On tails, there's a complication or repercussion.

To begin, destroy this dossier.

# Hundreds of miles to Safetown (200 Days)

 
```
It's hundreds of miles to Safetown.
It'll take 200 DAYS to get there, maybe longer.


Choose a PARTNER.

What brought you together?
Why can't you stay?
How will you get there?


Not every day is eventful. To PASS TIME, both roll a d20.

The DIFFERENCE is how an EVENT affects your partnership.

    When the DIFFERENCE is less than SEVEN, the EVENT brings you closer together.
        Something makes your day.

    When the DIFFERENCE is SEVEN or more, the EVENT drives you farther apart.
        Something important is lost or broken.

    When you roll the same number, you enjoy the peak of your relationship.
        Something in your chest expands.

    When a 1 and 20 are rolled, the EVENT creates an unmendable rift.
        Something will never be forgiven.
        Leave your PARTNER behind.

Create EVENTS together and overcome them together.


The SUM is how many days pass after the EVENT. PASS TIME until 200 DAYS have come and gone.

Complete the journey.


-: Optional EVENT Aid : draw inspiration for each rolled digit (20 = 2 and 0) :-

0   a FRIEND            1   a STRANGER
2   a BEAST             3   a PLANT
4   the NIGHT           5   the WEATHER
6   our FOOD            7   our GEAR
8   the PAST            9   the FUTURE

# Sincerely Yours.

 
```
Put away all distractions (e.g. phones) in a bag.
Sit with other players all around the table and put a bowl at the center.

1. Each player writes anonymously a real secret about himself/herself, a confession, or a private thought (in no more than 20 words) on a piece of paper and put it in the bowl. Make sure that everyone uses the same pen color.
2. Shake the bowl.
3. Each player picks up a piece of paper from the bowl and reads it silence. 
4. Then each player pass the piece of paper to the player on the right until every piece of paper is read by everyone.
5. All the players must return all the pieces of paper in the bowl. 
6. One of the players lights up a match and throw it in the bowl, giving fire to the secrets that will vanish forever.

Now you got closer to your friends, you know their secrets. But you won't know who they belong to.

# Baker's Coven
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Mention of witchcraft, burning at the stake, player death. !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Each player starts with 1 MANA, then another each turn.
During their turn, they either Store or Cast MANA.

Storing saves the point for next turn.
Casting spends all MANA to Enhance your dish by as many stars, Defend against spells equal or lower than the MANA you spent, or cause Mischief lowering an opponent's BAKE.


Stats:

BAKE: How delicious your treats are. Can be temporarily increased or decreased with MANA(minimum:-2 maximum:+3). Starts at 1.

REPUTATION: How much civilians admire you. If it drops to 0, you're executed as a witch. Starts at 3.


You roll 1d6+BAKE to determine your recipe's stars:

<0: Putrid. -1 REPUTATION and BAKE, or 2 REPUTATION if BAKE's at minimum.

1-2: Disgusting. -1 REPUTATION.

3: Bland. No loss/gain.

4-5: Delicious! +1 REPUTATION

6<: Golden Dish! Immune to Mischief! +1 REPUTATION

Outside events can affect the bakers stats, thieves that make great secret ingredients and supernatural connections to help your business thrive! ...If you pay your debts.

# Super Lost

 
```
Paranormal investigators go into a haunted location (forest, manor etc.) that shifts and changes making it difficult to leave. The only way forward is to find and confront the Evil that controls the location.

Players 

Describe backstory, careers, expertise. 

Roll 2d6 to perform tasks. A 9 or higher is a success. You may get bonuses to rolls based on expertise or circumstance.

Gamemaster

Each time the players move on from a region one player rolls 2d6. If it is a 12, they have found a significant location. Once 3 significant locations are found, they will travel to the Evil on the next turn.

Flavor significant locations and the Evil however you see fit. 

Defeating The Evil

Get creative with the Evil. Encourage players to come up with clever ways to deal with it and give bonuses accordingly.

First, players get a chance at the evil. The evil is defeated when all players roll successes in a turn. Adjust as needed.

If they fail, the Evil gets to go. 

Each player rolls an evasion for the evil. If they fail, they take a permanent -1 penalty to rolls. If they roll a 2 they are killed outright.

# BE THE MOTHERF***ING LORAX

 
```
A player chooses a tree to claim. They must yell "I SPEAK FOR THIS TREE!" 

Each player must defend why they speak for that tree, they must include in their statement;

What kind of tree it is (you can name any type of tree or make up a name for it).
What this tree wants to say.
How the tree got there. Were they simply planted there? Were they from far away? 

Each player must then declare something the tree needs to continue being successful. 

In order to get the things the tree needs they must ask people around them, who are NOT Lorax's. In order to ask for things they can casually ask them, sing it, scream it at them (in a non-threatening way). If they say no to whatever you request just walk away. If they say yes, then start to persuade them to join you in being a Lorax for your tree. 

If someone willingly approaches you and your tree, the only thing you are allowed to say to them "I AM THE LORAX AND I SPEAK FOR THIS TREE!"

Game is over once it reaches 15 Lorax's. The game must start with at least 3 Lorax's.

# Defixiones Memoria, a Demonic Duel
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: memory, trauma, flashbacks  !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Both:
Narrate all actions; be theatrical.  
 
Sorcerer:
Bind a Demon: write your desires on a defixione (curse tablet). Recite binding. 
 
Demon:
Ripped from your infernal realm, announce your truename and historical misdeeds.
 
Sensing weakness, plunder Sorcerer's memories. Use any image search website. Find three images representing powerful emotional experiences from Sorcerer's lifetime. Use terms: Love, War, Art.
 
Show Sorcerer. 
 
Sorcerer:
Experience memories, full-force.
 
On 3 notecards, write a one-sentence story-your memory of each image. Secretly number each from 1 (strongest) to 3 (weakest), writing number on back. 

Read memories aloud to Demon. 

Shuffle cards and give to Demon, memory-side up.
 
Demon:
For six minutes, interrogate. Use cunning and cruelty; divine Sorcerer's true feelings about each memory. Spellbound, Sorcerer must respond truthfully, in visceral detail.
 
Sorcerer:
Interrogation may surface new emotions. If necessary, re-number cards.
 
Demon:
Use your learnings; arrange memories from strongest to weakest. Declare your reasoning.
 
Both:
Sorcerer, reveal sequence.
 
If Demon numbered all three correctly, the binding fails.
Demon, break Sorcerer's will with memories. Condemn them to their eternal fate.
 
If Demon fails, they are bound.
Sorcerer, tell Demon the menial tasks and great boons you will ask over the next millennia.
 
Variant memories:
