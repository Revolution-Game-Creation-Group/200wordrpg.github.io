# One Shot, One Kill
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: murder !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
Target: Codename Mr. White
Estimated Net Worth: $12,000,000,000
Occupation: Philanthropist
Silent donor with high spending on security, privacy, PR.
DoB: Today (year unknown)
Infiltrate party on floor 10 of the Grand Park Hotel; retrieve (1) standard 9mm handgun and (1) untraceable bullet; eliminate target.
Standard Agency Non-ID Protocol

Things that are true: 
* You are contractors working together to complete this job.
* You have never met before tonight.
* You have never heard of Mr. White before tonight.

To make a character: Tell everyone what they look like, what we should call them, and how we should refer to them.

When you try to do something specialized, make a skill check.
* Basic tasks don't require checks, even if they're a little bit hard.
* Checks don't allow you to attempt the wildly improbable.

To make a skill check:
If you have a skill that covers it, you automatically succeed.
If you don't, flip a coin. On heads, you succeed. If you succeed and no one else has a skill for this kind of thing already, write down a name for your new skill.
Whether you succeed or fail, flip again. On tails, there's a complication or repercussion.

To begin, destroy this dossier.

# After

 
```
The world is as old as time, it rests in an ancient slumber. Iron and steel creeps from its tombs, to haunt the green world above. Ancient wonders waiting to be found, as miasmas sweep the land. Adventures arise to tempt fate, one last time.

Decide on a GM

Describe your wildly adventurer, give them two traits, one good, one bad. Design them a key item,this is a contraption to help them in this broken world.

Each player chooses 3 skills, if the player fails 5 times attempting the skill, they get the skilled action free and always succeed.

Players get 5 cards from a 52 card deck and place them face down on the table. 
Draw from this stack to Spend or Lose a card, place Gained cards on the bottom. Used cards go into the draw pile, center on the table, which is shuffled each round.

To resolve, spend a card, if the players card number (King12,...,Ace1) is higher than the next draw pile card they succeed. Discard Both.

Anytime Adventures:
>Spend to resolve
>Lose when harmed

During Adventures Turns:
>Move
>Spend to acquire
>Give a card to a Player
>Draw 2

# Rising Tides
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: Apocalypse, Tsunamis !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
The globe warmed. The ocean invaded your city and its people fled, but you could or would not follow them. You surf the waves atop its sunken streets to survive.

The Fibonacci Sequence tracks your Will to Live. You start at 0.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

When the tsunami comes you abandon your crumbling home and take to the skyscraper-gridded waterways, roll (1d6 x 10) + 1d6 to surf for your life. If you roll lower than your current Will, the tsunami consumes you and your board. 

Survival is pain. If you survive a tsunami, advance your Sequence by 4 steps. Start the game with a tsunami.

Between tsunamis, you strain to establish a home. After each of the following acts, roll 1d6. On a 6, another tsunami ravages the city.

If you selflessly comfort another survivor, advance your Sequence by 1 step and retreat theirs by 1.

If you search for meaning, roll 1d6. On a 2 or lower, you find something of beauty and retreat your Sequence by 1. On a 3 or higher, you find something of stabbing nostalgia and loss and advance your Sequence by 1.

# SchrÃ¶dinger's Underwear

 
```
- Players become characters.

- Discuss safety and consent.

- You're on a date and it's going very well. In fact, this date could end with some (very consensual) sexy times. Trouble is, you cannot remember what underwear you're wearing. Are they 'hot', or should they have been burned long ago?

- Inexplicably there's no opportunity to check your underwear situation during the date.

- Players take turns progressing one step at a time through their date.
- Start by rolling each die to recall a memory about your underwear.
- Describe your date, integrate your memory.

- Itinerary
  - Pick Up
  - Lunch
  - Activity
  - Activity
  - Activity
  - Dinner
  - Drive home
  - Pre-sexy times
    - No need to go into the sexy times, game ends when underwear is revealed.

- Dice

  - d6 = The recollection comes from something you...
    - 6. Touch
    - 5. Taste
    - 4. Hear
    - 3. See
    - 2. Smell
    - 1. Sudden memory (wild)
      - Limit 2 repeats

  - d4 = the recalled perception of your underwear
    - 4  -->   -->   --> 1
    - Yay / OK / Meh / Boo

  - d8 = your confidence in your recollection 
    - 8 high --> 1 low

- Track your overall confidence (d8), weighed against your perception (d4).

- During the last round, consider your overall confidence and describe how you go about revealing your underwear. Describe your underwear based on what you have deduced.

# Weave-Tellings

 
```
Collect a ball of yarn. With three or more people, gather in a circle in a large area. 

Each person gathered is a potential Speaker. The role of a Speaker is to add to the Telling.

All Tellings start with a single problem. There might be a mighty and terrible war between nations, or the strain of jealousy between neighbors in a small community. The first Speaker establishes what the problem is for the Telling.

Once a Telling has a problem, the Speaker must loop the yarn once around their hand and then pass the ball to another person.

Not all gathered may want to add to the Telling. The next Speaker in turn is someone who will describe how a single character in the Telling encounters the problem and how they seek to resolve it. When they are finished, they must loop their hand in the yarn and pass the ball to the next willing Speaker.

A Telling continues as long as there is yarn to spin. Each speaker maintains their threads to the ball as it is passed, and all Speakers describe only a single, new character. A weave grows through the connections between characters and Speakers.

# IF/THEN, a Diceless Paranormal Victorian RPG
<div id="warning"><div id="content"><h3><strong>! Content Warning: imperialism, Rudyard Kipling, death !</strong></h3><i>Continue scrolling to read the entry.</i></div></div>
 
```
	How do actual people deal with the mechanical empire of Victoria, mingled with the moralistic horror of Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard Kipling? When social order is tyranny and deviation is demonic, what is a paranormal investigator to do?
Characters distribute 15 points across 4 attributes: Logic (costs double), Quickness, Perceptiveness, and Vitality. Players can petition the referee for a special ability and corresponding disadvantage.	
	Characters attempting feats of skill, observation, and the like compare the relevant attribute to a difficulty threshold assigned by the referee. Three is average. No rolling is involved. If you have a low perceptiveness, you're going to miss most potential clues.
Danger and confrontations: Each round you write your main action. For each point of logic, write a conditional If/Then statement to respond to an action you think another person might do. In descending quickness order, people perform their main actions. If this triggers If/Then statements, those interrupt it. If one action has multiple responses, resolve in descending quickness order.
Injuries give -1 vitality. At 0 you are incapacitated or dead. An exception: bullets put you down in just one or two hits.

# Midlife Crisis on Infinite Earths

 
```
One person adjudicates the game and helps stage conflicts.  They are the Monitor.

Give each player one red playing card and one black playing card.

Each player creates a middle-aged individual.

Each player also creates an alternate-universe version of another player's character that has been pulled into our universe.

Each player randomly assigns their cards, in secret (they can look) to their two characters.  The character with the red card is possessed by an evil force and wants to ruin lives.  They want to supplant their non-evil counterpart.

For each character, assign a D6, D10, and D12 to the stats Confidence, Longing, and Nostalgia, as desired.

Assign each character a crisis (a divorce, job loss, etc.) and a goal (new love, reconciliation, etc.).  Define the relationships between the characters.  All non-alternate characters are from the same universe.  Alternates do not need to be.

Play starts with the Monitor setting a scene and calling out at least two characters who are present, and continues until a conclusion is apparent.  Repeat as required by your story.

Resolve conflicts by describing the action, deciding the relevant stat, and rolling the assigned die (highest roll wins or meeting target set by the Monitor).
