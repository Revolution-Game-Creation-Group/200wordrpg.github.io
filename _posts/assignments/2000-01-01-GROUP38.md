# Are You My Maker?

 
```
One Game Master. One silent Golem. One RPG dice set. Hope starts at d12.

Begin play in the ever-expansive Sunless Sands. 

GOLEM ASKS:
-What burning runes mark my hull?
-What eerie Threat lurks nearby?
-What steading am I lumbering towards?

Then play five scenes, each centered on a possible Maker.

GOLEM ASKS:
-What is their Vocation?
-How do they show themselves to be both kind and unkind?
-How are we connected?
-What do they want to use me for?

When the Golem communicates "are you my maker?" roll Hope, then decrease the die size. If you rolled a 3 or lower, there is strong evidence they are. 

After the fifth scene, the Golem chooses a new Master or renounces them all and wanders the Sunless Sands. 

Then the Threat descends upon you.

GOLEM ANSWERS:
-What hope do I have?
-Does the threat overpower me?
-Whose servant am I?

D4 Threats
1- demon vultures
2- pale sandwyrm
3- metal-hungry scavengers
4- insane efreeti

D12 Vocations
1- ember alchemist
2- dust artist 
3- sitar master
4- obsidian warlord
5- caravan financier
6- sandwyrm harpooner
7- azure priestess
8- crescent smith
9- inventive urchin
10- foreign astrologist
11- alabaster princess
12- silk magi

# Interdimensional Battle of the Bands

 
```
REQUIRES: 1 MC, 1+ Players, 1 Deck of cards, 1 die for each player

Radical! Your band just qualified for the Interdimensional Battle of the Bands! Name and Describe your Band!

ATTRIBUTES:

Players start with 1 point in HYPE, HEART and SKILL, then distributes 6 more points between them (max 5). 

NPC bands are built the same way.

NON-COMBAT:
 
HEART = Social 
SKILL = Physical

Roll under your Attribute to succeed. Roll the exact amount for a critical success!

BATTLES:

Players and MC draws cards equal to their HYPE. MC starts playing a song.

On each players turn they turn over a card and roll against the MC.

RED cards roll HEART
BLACK cards roll SKILL

The goal is to roll higher than the MC, but less than or equal to HEART or SKILL. Rolling higher counts as 0.

Whoever has the highest result is the winner and keeps the card.

If it's a tie, either can use one of their HYPE cards to roll the attribute attached to the HYPE card. Winner keeps all cards played, other cards are discarded.

When the song ends, measure the Applause-O-Meter! If the players have more cards than the MC, they win the battle.

# Small Spaces

 
```
You're the first group of humans to live long term in outer space. 

Describe what you live in, is it a small dome, ship, or station? 
What supplies do you have? 
What supplies are you lacking? 

Introduces yourself 
- What's your job? 
- Why you're here?
- How do you feel about someone you work with? 
- How you spend your free time? 


How to play 

Each player takes two notecards and writes a complication word on one and an emotional word on the other. These words are the themes for each scene. Place the cards in the middle of the group and have someone start by pulling a card. They're the narrator for this scene as it will be from their point of view. They must use the word on the card to come up with and act out an event that happens during the first week living as a group. The scene can be just them or whoever they want to be in it with them. There is no limit on how many people are in a scene. Each pull from the deck is a new week, then on the second round a new month until you end on the last card.

# Goblin Voltron

 
```
----------

The players are goblins in a shared disguise (e.g. "Baron Notagoblin"). They must work together to accomplish a GOAL (e.g. "Bake a cake for the king") with as many STEPS as there are Goblins ("Gather ingredients", "Preheat oven", etc).

Goblins and GM alternate turns, until Goblins accomplish their Goal or get Busted.

----------

GM TURN
The GM throws an obstacle at the Goblins. They must either DO SOMETHING!!! or take a Problem.

----------

GOBLIN TURN
Players pick one:
- DO SOMETHING!!! (accomplish one Step of their Goal)
- FIX IT!!! (eliminate Problems)

----------

DO SOMETHING!!!
- On separate cards, Goblins each write down what they want their shared goblin voltron to do.
- Goblins reveal cards.
- Everything happens simultaneously; GM narrates the ridiculous results.
  ALL DIFFERENT: Total Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, but gain a Problem.
  2+ THE SAME: Controlled Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, and nothing else happens. Phew!
  ALL SAME: Cool Chaos. Goblins accomplish their aim, and fix a Problem in the process.

FIX IT!!!
- Pick 2 Problems.
- FIX IT!!!
- Eliminate them. (Hopefully you didn't make any more!)

----------

TOO MANY PROBLEM!!!
If Goblins have 3 or more Problems at the end of their turn, they gain a STRIKE. Three Strikes and they're BUSTED!

# Codeck

 
```
Codeck is a GM-less TTRPG inspired by the world's most popular tactical espionage action video game series. Players take on the roles of a solo operative on a dangerous infiltration mission and their support team who are in radio contact. All roleplay is done via radio conversations.

Each player decides who their character is. Whoever most recently handled a cardboard box takes the first turn.

== Gameplay ==
> Draw a card from a deck of playing cards.
> Make a radio call based on the prompts below. Other players may join in the call (except on private frequencies).
> When the call ends (natural conclusion, or operative hangs up) the next player takes their turn.
> Any amount of mission time may elapse between calls.

== Prompts ==
> Hearts: emotional melodrama.
> Diamonds: the villains' plot.
> Clubs: discuss an obstacle facing the operative.
> Spades: elaborate historical context.
> A-2: make the call on a private frequency.
> 3-5: reveal a secret.
> 6-7: make an analogy to popular culture or philosophy.
> 10: introduce a new character to the radio conversation (take on an additional role).
> J-Q: call immediately before or after a boss fight.
> K: reveal what may happen when the deck is exhausted (end of the game).

# Dirty Papers

 
```
for 3-6 players

SUPPLIES
1+ pencils
Index cards
Paper
Dice

SETUP
You're an archaeological team in ancient ruins. One player is the Professor; going clockwise, each player has less seniority.

Each describe something about the landscape, ruins, and camp.

DIG DAYS
Start on Day 1. Progress starts at 1.

On each Day:
1) Roll dice equal to Progress. Even results are Finds. Add 1 Progress per Find.

2) Taking turns in seniority order, describe a Find, and write that on a card, until each is described.

3) Discuss these Finds. Write your interpretation of each on its card. Anyone above you can cross yours out; anyone above them can re-write it, and so on.

4) If you described none, or fewer than the Professor, describe something about the landscape, ruins, or camp.

5) Tally each player's interpretations (re-written ones count for each player who wrote them). In descending order, voice a judgement about the people who lived here. Later judgements cannot contradict earlier ones. Write them down.

Go to the next Day.

TURNING POINT
If a Day has 3+ Finds, do not increase Progress. On future Days, subtract 1 Progress per Find.

When Progress reaches 0, end the Dig.

# The Unspeakable Wisdom

 
```
Take tokens, this game, post-its, 6 friends.

*************************************STORY*************************************

Go to a library. As you enter-- be quiet! 
You are in 1988. No internet, no computers.

This rules are the Dead Scrolls, written in a complex eldritch language. You were asked to translate them.

*************************************RULES*************************************

Each of you is an eminence in 2 disciplinary different fields: physics, literature, biology... Get a token for each fringe discipline you choose. 

You cannot talk to each other since you live in different countries. To translate, ask yourself something about the Story/Rules, then read books of your fields. When you find the same noun/verb in 7 different books, write it on a post-it: that's a piece of the translation. 

Send letters to the other researchers; if someone replays to you and guesses one of your words, get a token. 

If you speak/write one of your words, lose a token; with none, you lose your mind. 

The first to reach 7 words/tokens reunite all players and get help on the translation: mix up the post-it to create a phrase. Anyone may spend a token to add 3 to 5 new words. 
Use the phrase to expand the Story/the Rules.
