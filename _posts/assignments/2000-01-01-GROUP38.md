# Are You My Maker?

 
```
One Game Master. One silent Golem. One RPG dice set. Hope starts at d12.

Begin play in the ever-expansive Sunless Sands. 

GOLEM ASKS:
-What burning runes mark my hull?
-What eerie Threat lurks nearby?
-What steading am I lumbering towards?

Then play five scenes, each centered on a possible Maker.

GOLEM ASKS:
-What is their Vocation?
-How do they show themselves to be both kind and unkind?
-How are we connected?
-What do they want to use me for?

When the Golem communicates "are you my maker?" roll Hope, then decrease the die size. If you rolled a 3 or lower, there is strong evidence they are. 

After the fifth scene, the Golem chooses a new Master or renounces them all and wanders the Sunless Sands. 

Then the Threat descends upon you.

GOLEM ANSWERS:
-What hope do I have?
-Does the threat overpower me?
-Whose servant am I?

D4 Threats
1- demon vultures
2- pale sandwyrm
3- metal-hungry scavengers
4- insane efreeti

D12 Vocations
1- ember alchemist
2- dust artist 
3- sitar master
4- obsidian warlord
5- caravan financier
6- sandwyrm harpooner
7- azure priestess
8- crescent smith
9- inventive urchin
10- foreign astrologist
11- alabaster princess
12- silk magi

# We. Are. GNOMES!!!

 
```
Your endless ingenuity and creative prowess threaten the Emperor. Rounded up and imprisoned, your people work away your days in forced labour. In 4 days, you escape together.

Build the prison, roll 2d6, each result eliminates a feature: 1-Magical Locks, 2-Underwater, 3-Underground, 4-Beasts, 5-Unblinking Guards, 6-Turrets.

Each day, Build or Aid towards a component for The Contraption. Each component foils a prison feature. To Build, Roll 2d6. DC 5+ succeeds. If successful, roll an additional d6 to conceal your work. If die share a value with either of the Build die cast, you conceal the ruse, and the component is built. If doubles are rolled you are discovered: increase Build DC +1, you may only Build until the escape. To Aid another, you may reroll any one die cast by a player who builds. Only one player may Aid per Build.
Each day sees the total for a success increase by 1. If a component seems outlandish (and it should), Increase Build DC +1, roll 2d6 to conceal. Dumb guards won't see it coming.

On the 5th day, you make your escape, describe how The Contraption undermines the prison features.

# Little Green Men Scouting

 
```
You are a squad of Aliens sent to Scout Earth during the 1950's.

You have Advanced Camouflage Devices, but don't know the precise settings to use.

You are to observe Normal Human Activities.

When you Observe Humans, roll d6. On a 6, you understand the situation, anything else, and you miss Significant Context and must keep observing. Your interpretation of the situation should be colored by the missing context.

Each time you observe, roll d6. On a 6, the Camouflage works, anything else, and a human starts suspecting you.

You're not authorized to hurt humans, but lying, running away, and Memory Rays are all options. To undertake something risky, roll d6. On a 4+, you succeed, anything else, and the situation gets more complicated.

Once you have successfully Observed, you may move on and find another Activity.

When you must Beam Yourself Up, make a Report. Roll a d6 and add the number of successful Observations. On a 6+, your commander is pleased. On a failure, you're sent to the cloning vats to be recycled!

Beware of: Communists, Police, Rednecks, and the Men in Black.
Use: Advanced Alien tech, Cloning Chambers, Memory Rays, Tractor Beams.

# Bot's First Words

 
```
One of you is a human who has built a robot and wants to teach it to speak. The other is the robot, who just wants to make their parent happy. You will need 8 coins.

Robot only:
// n is the number of coins in front of you
n = 4
// You can only repeat what other people say. When you repeat what your parent says, flip the coins and arrange the flips in a line. Read the flips like binary; coins represent 0 or 1 (tails or heads).
// 0000 == 0
// 0001 == 1
// 0010 == 2
// 0011 == 3
// 0100 == 4
// Etc

If result < 2^(n - 1)
stutter and misspeak. 
// If you are frustrated, how do you lash out? Do you think your parent is disappointed in you?

If you think your parent might have spoken in anger,
n = n - 1. 
If you are certain that they saw you succeed and were proud of you,
n = n + 1.

When n == 0, explain how you carry this failure with you. 
// How does it hurt? Do you ever learn to speak?

When n == 8, say something to your parent that you always wanted to but never could.
// How will you use the speech you've learned?

# Dear Friend...

 
```
For 2 players using letters written from the perspective of their character, sent via snail mail. There are 8 exchanges, for a total of 16 letters. 7 rounds have predetermined prompts, as follows:

Home
Hope
Love
Hate
Fear
Light
Darkness

 The 8th is chosen by player 1. Prompts are intentionally vague. 

Player 1 is the person who most recently received personal correspondence. They write a classified ad seeking their ideal pen-pal, 40 words or less, including their mailing address and an inspiration for setting. The ad ends with the eighth prompt. They share this ad using the method of their choice. 

Example:
Pen Pal for conversation. Must love storytelling and have diverse interests. Ideally lives near a temporal vortex. 8 River Dr., Pallino, MA, 99999. FLAME.
Player 2 responds, and play continues back and forth.

When writing a letter, roll a D6 and compare the result to the numeral of the day the most recent letter was postmarked. If both are odd or both even, the prompt results in a "good" outcome. Otherwise, it is "bad". Players determine what this means. 

Be creative. Suggestions include hand-made envelopes, lovely cards, pictures, or flowers.

# Imposter

 
```
You remember nothing. The three faces look intently at you. Your dissertation defense committee. A Reader says, "The title of your dissertation is..." and they tell you the title, but you remember nothing. 

One player is the Student, three are Readers. The Student is doing their final defense of a doctoral dissertation, but they have forgotten everything about it. The Readers should leave the Student alone to create a dissertation title that the player playing the Student knows nothing about. After telling the Student the title, the Readers ask questions of the Student about the dissertation. The questions should be specific and leading. Readers can ask as many questions as they want. Take turns. When all three Readers are satisfied, they decide if the Student passes or fails. It must be unanimous, or the Student fails. 

Reader Advice
Everything you say is true, even if it is contradictory. Prove you are the expert. Add pieces to the dissertation and ask the Student to explain them. Create a theory and ask why the Student didn't consider it. Say, "I see," a lot, ominously. 

Student Advice
No one can help you. Godspeed.
