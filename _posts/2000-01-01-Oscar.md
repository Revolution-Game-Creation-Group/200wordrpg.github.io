```
Game for 2-6 players, requires a deck of cards

History is broken! You are a unit of immortal shapeshifters from future who have been sent back in time on a one-way-trip to fix everything somehow. You can turn into anyone and can't go back in time again.

Each player starts the round with 5 cards, and after every turn draws 1 card, +1 if they had none.

Players go clockwise, each having one turn in a round. Player whose turn it is flips the top card and describes how they messed up a historical situation. 

Afterwards, players can play any number of cards, describing how do they fix the situation. Card that's played must match the suit or rank of previously played card. Play until the situation is fixed, or you run out of playable cards.

Get descriptive and keep it fun!

Hearts: save someone from death, create object
Diamonds: replace someone dead, give object
Clubs: remove someone, destroy object
Spades: fake someone's death, steal object

# Burning Boardrooms
```
Playing
You, the players, are the kind of people that don't get to be heroes on TV.
The person running things is the CEO. They'll call the cops.

Decide which 'corp you're hitting, and why. 
The CEO narrates the world's actions. You narrate yours.
Cause trouble. Run from the cops. Go home.

Characters
Distribute five dice across these Stats. It doesn't matter what dice they are.
Chrome is for using your cyberware.
Body is for punching, running, etc.
Mind is for hacking, speaking, etc.
Lose a Stat dice if you get hurt - take it back if you get help. If you have none left, you're dead.

Pick three Skills you're good at (one dice), and one Skill you're great at (two dice).

The more trouble you cause, the more Scene dice you get. Your CEO will decide how many, between one and three. Once the cops arrive, you get zero. It's time to leave. 

Rolling
Roll dice from (Stat + Skill + Scene). Odds equal one hit. 
Roll one less if it's hard or you're at a disadvantage. 
Zero hits fails. One gets you success at a price. Two gets you it without. 
The price might be your;
stuff
health
friendships
attitude

# The Study
```
Set up a word crossing game

There's a small world.
Creatures that know a lot live on it.
You want to learn about them.
But you know very little of their language.

You learned 10,000 words they know best,
And their meanings.

One is the humans.
That one may speak any word.
They act as every human, and the world.

The rest are the ones who study the humans, from another world.

What is it like?

The ones who study may only speak and understand the 10,000 words for conversation with humans.
They can speak to each other without breaking rules in their own language

When the ones who study don't know a word the humans use, they may try to learn to use it.
Pick 5 letters from a bag.
If you can make the word with them, plus any words on the game board, you learn it.
If you cannot make the word, write it. You learned it wrong.

If you were right, tell the others what it means.
If you were wrong, tell them what you think it means.
Write the wrong meaning.
You may only guess once for each word.

Go home.
What did you learn?

# Chirographicon
```
Chirographicon

The demon threads in shadow. Even children know this. Do not turn around and ask for favour. It will twist your wants around your neck and strangle you slowly... unless "they" come by. Only then will your soul have a chance at redemption.

"They" are people who specialize in winning souls of fools from the darkness. The only way to accomplish this - the Redimet Verse.

Prepare and show "them" the Chirograph and describe the tragedy it brought. Throw 3d6 to generate the words of the Verse:

Word 1: Catch Recite Race Cut Kill Trade
Word 2: Yourself Family Wife Child Demon Saint
Word 3: Cry Smile Moon Sun Needle Sword

Example: (4)Cut (4)your child's tongue out while (2)smiling. 
Example: (2)Recite a poem about (1)yourself while staring at the (4)sun.

"They" throw 1d6 each and keep the results, so do you - demon. 

"They" conjure up a way to trick you and bargain in the fool's name. 

Every sentence costs a point from that characters pool. 

You can ignore "their" words by paying the same price per sentence. 

Once someones pool runs out - they fall silent. 

Do not let "them" STEAL from you.
```
<hr>

# The Word for the World is...
```
Each player represents a different race and takes five blank notecards, putting a single made-up word on each card and their race, such as: Vrellin - Elvish. 

Everyone selects one word to keep, passing the rest to their left.  Continue to pick words, passing the rest, until each player has five words.

Players write definitions for each word they have. Example: Vrellin - A period of light before dawn when birds sing. 

Players select one word to keep, passing the rest to their left, continuing until they have another set of five words.  This time write the origin of the word under the definition.  Example: First used by the Silvinari Elves of Everwood Forest.  

If playing a different race, such as Kobolds, the origin looks like this: Loan word, first used by Duskhold Kobolds, later adapted by Elves for the poetry it invoked.

Again, players select one word to keep, passing the rest to their left for a final set of five words. This time, determine if each word is obsolete, still in use, or newly coined.

Once the last word is determined, read all the words, sharing the linguistic history of the world as told through the races who live there.

# The Oreo One-Shot
```
Premise
* This is a one-shot comedy RPG where players change the setting by eating Oreos.
* Play until the story ends.
* Try not to destroy the world.

How Does It Work?
* Each player gets 3 Oreos (or whatever you'd prefer).
* Eat one to make any change you like to the world.
* But you can't undo another person's change (because that's no fun).
* Game takes place in modern-day reality until stated otherwise.

Character Creation
* GM assigns each player a letter (A, B, C etc...)
* Each player gives their PC a name starting with that letter.
* Player A declares how their character knows player B's.  B does the same to C.  This continues until every PC has a pre-existing relationship with two other characters.

Gameplay
* Uses 1d6.  Only players roll.  Succeed if you roll 4 or higher.
* If players roll against each other.  Highest number wins.  In case of a tie, GM decides.
* You can give yourself a skill at any time (it can be whatever you want).  You can't have more than 3.  Skills give you a +1 bonus (which doesn't stack).
* Once per session you can shout "Marmite!" before rolling.  Success gives a Crit.  Failure gives a Botch.

# Signs and Symbols
```
Four players play as rival prophets who have gathered to discuss the meaning of a shared vision.

Materials: Pens, index cards, assorted images (Dixit/Mysterium cards preferred)

Preparation:
Players should agree upon a religious setting. 

Write each prophetic perspective on an individual index card:
Prosperity-Good present, good future
Repentance-Bad present, good future
Apocalypse-Good present, bad future
Nihilist-Bad present, bad future

Randomly assign one perspective card per player.

Shuffle the assorted images and randomly choose three, placing them face down in the center of the table. 

Gameplay:
The game is played over three rounds. At the start of each round, one image is revealed which portrays part of the vision. 

The prophets take turns expounding upon the meaning of this portion of the vision from their unique perspectives. After the first prophet speaks, each subsequent prophet will agree with a portion of the former interpretation, while adding a unique perspective in an "I agree that...but you missed..." style. Rearrange player order each round.

At the end of a round, randomly select one player's index card as the 'correct' interpretation. At the end of subsequent rounds, players work together to form correct interpretations into a cohesive whole.

# Air Traffic Control Room
```
This is a very frustrating game for crazy-loud people and people who write really quickly! 

Materials: Paper, pens, outside voices

The quietest person or the best listener is the Air Traffic Controller. (You can also take turns, if you like.) Everybody else is a Pilot.

Set a timer for sixty seconds. Now, the Pilots write down as many flight times, weather hazards, delays, cancellations, etc. as they can think of. When the timer goes off, stop.

Next, set a timer for three minutes. During this time, the Pilots SHOUT everything they wrote at the Air Traffic Controller. The Air Traffic Controller writes down as much as they can hear on their paper. 

When the timer goes off, stop. The Air Traffic Controller reads everything they wrote. The Pilots mark all of the data that the Air Traffic Controller got right.

The Pilots take turns making up stories about the problems that occured. What happened to that flight to Nashville that got delayed four hours? Were the Beatles on that plane? Did they miss their own concert? 

Endgame Scoring: Tally up the number of correct data points that each Pilot communicated. The Pilot who correctly communicated the most is the winner!

# Turbo System: An RPG for everything
```
This is a storytelling game. You need at least two people to play. One takes on the role of storyteller and the others will be characters.

The storyteller describes a scene and asks what the characters do. The other players respond and the story goes on.

All characters have 2 attributes: mind and body.  Each player must distribute 4 points between these two attributes without any of them having a value equal to zero.

Mind is used in dialogue situations or if your character has mental or magical powers.

Body is used in physical tests and combat.

Write on your character sheet the name, a merit and a flaw. If a merit or flaw is applicable in a scene, the storyteller may request that the player roll the dice again. The best result is used in case of merit and worst in case of flaw.

When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain, we have a conflict.

Every time you have a conflict, roll 1d6 plus the value of the attribute. If you roll 5 or more, the character can solve the problem.

You can tell any story using these rules, choose one theme that you find fun.

# Books RPG
```
Each person should bring one book, novel-sized, but not necessarily fictional.
To flip to a random page in your book is to "flip."
Reflip if the requested feature isn't present.

PLAYERS
Flip. 
On this page, pick and write down:
-any string of words. That's your NAME.
-a combined total of three verbs (gerunds allowed) and adjectives. You are good at or have these QUALITIES.
-any two nouns. Use these TOOLS.

Checks
When you face a test that you might fail at, flip. Close your eyes, point to a random part of the page. Use one word in this line or the two surrounding to explain a connection, that makes narrative sense, to any of your Qualities. You succeed if you can. If a word exactly matches one of your Qualities, you succeed greatly.

Examples: 
Use your "FIGHTING" (Quality) against the "WOMAN" (found word) to defeat the villain.
Explain what you know about how "HORSES" (found word) "RUN" (Quality) to gamble.

GAME MASTER
Embrace weirdness and accept stretches.

Flip five times. Pick one on the page from each flip:
Exposition Location
Two Rising Action Challenges
Climax Challenge
Denouement Location

Follow this novelistic structure, moving on as the players accomplish things.

# PSYCHIC CHILDREN ON THE RUN FROM DANGER
```
You are a PSYCHIC CHILD, the result of some unethical experiments. You and some of the other children have BROKEN OUT and are on the run from menacing agents who track you down.

Choose a PSYCHIC SPECIALTY - Telekinesis, Telepathy, Pyrokinesis, etc.

Decide what you REMEMBER from BEFORE - A treehouse, a book, a sweet treat, and other such things.

When you must use your powers, predict what the next card drawn from a deck of playing cards will be.

If your card is the same COLOR, your power does not harm you.

If you get the SUIT right, you have little control over your power. 

If you get the RANK correct, your power bends to your will, and you may do one thing with it as you choose.

If you guess the card EXACTLY, you AWAKEN. Your power dictates the course of the scene.

If you FAIL completely, you are stressed. Place the card in front of you, and if you have ten cards you are EXHAUSTED, and may be captured!

You must follow your MEMORY to find a SAFE PLACE. When your memory relates to the challenge before you, you may draw THREE cards and choose ONE. Good luck, children.

# After Man
```
After Man

It is an unknown time after humans have destroyed themselves. Animals have evolved and started their own civilizations. The rodents have evolved the fastest. Thus, the character races are mice, rats, racoon, rabbits, and so on. Squirrels are the most advanced and have sprawling tree cities. They adventure in the ruins of the ancients (human cities). Other animals evolved into more vicious predators. Think D&D with different rodent races. The grey squirrels are the most abundant and common of the hero races. While the mice are the most abundant of the evil races, think of them as the goblin and rats as the orc.

 

Human descendants in After Man are giant (compared to our heroes) mutated monstrosities. They inhabit the vast overgrown ruins of an ancient time. But these ruins are also a place of wonderous treasures.

 

Just as the ape and man share the same ancestry, the rodents diverged as well. Meaning some just became larger versions of their old self. These are used for labor and mounts for the military of the squirrel kingdoms. The ability of rodents to climb most natural surfaces has led to alternative forms of combat and weapon designs.

# Several Miles From Heaven
```
First, you and a partner...
...secretly draw one birthmark on two Domains (see below) on each body.

...wear clothing on each Domain.

 

You are horny teenagers.
You are also burgeoning demigods (though you may not know this).
You will be stripping and telling stories.

NOTE: Consent. Stop Anytime.

* * *

Briefly share who you each are.

On your turn:

- Ask them to strip clothing from one Domain.
- Study their body. Describe the corresponding Adoration.
- They share their corresponding Secret.
- Swap turns. Start again.

When you reveal a birthmark on them, add supernatural hints to your Adorations.

When you reveal two birthmarks on them, stop playing and:
- if one of yours is revealed, your divinities spark. Together, narrate the ensuing, scorching sex.
- if neither of yours is revealed, their divinity gloriously ignites. Narrate your demise.


     Domain  |          Adoration             |            Secret
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Neck     |  Your awkward gesture of love  | A fear about the future

    Torso    | Their sexiest physical feature | An insecurity about their body

    Legs     | A naughty fantasy about them   | An early memory

  Left Hand  |     Kindness they enacted      | A guilty act

  Right Hand |    Cleverness they displayed   | A miserable failure

  Left Foot  |  Pleasant time spent together  | A hope for the future

  Right Foot |      Your first meeting        | A deep fear

# Great Wall
```
3+ players
Index cards
Pencils
Fortune Cookies

You are ADULTS returning to your home town. You are in a restaurant called GREAT WALL with FRIENDS from high school.

Put FORTUNE COOKIES on the table (1/player). Everyone gets an Index Card.

On the card write down three DRIVES:

1) Settle a score with ______
2) Make amends for _______
3) Resolve tension between ______ and me about _______

Leave room to MARK each drive thrice. 

At the bottom of the card write the QUESTION "What will happen to me after I leave here?" and leave room to answer it.

Every time you talk about one of your drives, MARK it. 

Talk about an event from long ago. Different players will remember it differently. When a DRIVE has three MARKS, resolve it, whatever that means to you. Do not mention it again.

When player marks a drive, ESCALATE a cookie. If it is wrapped, unwrap it. If it is whole, break it. If it is broken, eat half. When a COOKIE is gone, a player must use its fortune to answer the question on their card.

To prevent that answer from coming to pass, a player must EAT the fortune. Otherwise it will come true.
```
<hr>

# Walk About
```
A walking RPG for a GM, 1 player character (P1), and 2 players embodying conflicting desires of that character. The two aspects of the character will attempt to influence the direction P1 chooses to turn.

Left = a decision emphasizing Freedom
Right  = a decision emphasizing Safety
Straight = the default; circumstances will determine your fate instead of choice.

A player will argue for freedom or safety; the third player (P1) breaks the tie. When you cannot agree or run out of time, go straight. You cannot go backwards. You must keep moving.

Begin the game by deciding on a scenario and who you are--your collective character has a measure of authority/influence over others; your decisions affect lives. Perhaps you are a powerful sorcerer, the president, the beta of a wolf pack, or a mother. Begin to walk.

The GM narrates the story as you travel, taking cues directly from the environment (e.i, physical obstacles become obstacles in the story. A river on the left should make choosing freedom difficult). 

Walk until the story is resolved. 

Take note of where you end up. Reflect on the journey. How far did you travel? Was the destination worth the journey?

# Welcome to the Show
```
After you read this note tear it up. TEAR IT TO PIECES. Eat it if you have to. Prevent anyone else from reading this card.
We're sorry this is so last minute. The lights are already on. The mics are hot. You're about to go live. 

No one can know that I told you.
No one can know that you know. 
I'm sorry this puts you in danger. 
You are in a unique position, so I felt sharing was worth the risk.

You have been entrusted with this information because you are the host of the most watched night show.

Your first guest knows the secret. I don't know how they figured it out, but they did. 
Welcome them. Make small talk. Gain their trust.
Find a way to let them know. Find a way to make a plan.

If you get tripped up, if you think anyone suspects - bring on the next guest.
Get them all talking. They can be good cover.

Your whole crew, your other guests, all your viewers are lizard people. 

Be careful. Tear up this note. Throw it away.
Put on a good show. The whole world is watching. 
Good night and Good Luck.

# The Dying Swan
```
An RPG for 5 people

One player is the LEFT LEG
One player is the RIGHT LEG
One player is the LEFT ARM
One player is the RIGHT ARM
One player is GRAVITY

The LIMBS should work together to perform the short ballet solo The Dying Swan, as first performed by Anna Pavlova. GRAVITY should provide feedback on their actions.

A contemporary description of Pavlova's performance:

Arms folded, on tiptoe, she dreamily and slowly circles the stage. By even, gliding motions of the hands, returning to the background from whence she emerged, she seems to strive toward the horizon, as though a moment more and she will fly-exploring the confines of space with her soul. The tension gradually relaxes and she sinks to earth, arms waving faintly as in pain. Then faltering with irregular steps toward the edge of the stage-leg bones quiver like the strings of a harp-by one swift forward-gliding motion of the right foot to earth, she sinks on the left knee-the aerial creature struggling against earthly bonds; and there, transfixed by pain, she dies.
```
<hr>

# Empedocles: The Remains
```
The god Strife has scrambled all the living things. You wake up as a human flesh pile, you are blind and cannot speak. Begin play with one arm, one leg and one extra bit, such as an eye. There are more parts to collect somewhere. Try to aid the god Love and return yourself and your friends to their original forms. 

Doing Things:
Draw a line and divide it 15 times, number each division 3-18
Put a blue marker, such as a bead or poker chip, on 10 and a red marker on 11
When you do something risky, roll three six sided die and add them together.
If the sum falls on or between the blue/red markers, you're successful.
When you acquire a leg, move the blue marker left
When you acquire an arm, move the red marker right.
Extra bits: (eyes, breasts, hair) discard to add +1/-1 to the action if it makes sense. If you are trying to see something, discard an eye not a fingernail.
Lose a limb if harmed, two limbs if the harm is great.
If a limb is lost, someone can steal it.
You cannot die, even if you wish.

# Giant-Robot-Animal-Squad
```
2 oz bag of Skittles (candy) needed to play.

Five teenagers have been selected as pilots for Giant-Robot-Animal-Squad (GRAS), but only one can be the Giant-Robot-Animal-Person's head when they all combine.
Do what you must to become the head pilot.

Player choose a candy color. This is their uniform and robot-animal color.

When using candy for an action, its style is determined thus:

Red-love
Yellow-friendship
Green-gossip
Orange-passion
Purple-existential ennui

Start with 3 candies in your pool. Get all five colors in your Giant-Robot-Animal's HeartCore to win! If nobody wins, the project is scrapped. 

Each turn, a player draws one new candy, then picks one:

-Lock one candy in their HeartCore.
-Attack someone using one candy from their pool, destroying one candy in the target's HeartCore.
-Defend against future attacks by placing a defensive candy next to their HeartCore. Only one allowed at a time.

Players can defend others by using a candy from their pool. The attacker's attacking candy is destroyed. The defender gives their candy to the person they defend, but takes one of that person's HeartCore candies for their own pool.

Frame scenes/actions based on the candy color being used.

Eat destroyed candies.

# It Came From Studio 9
```
It Came from Studio 9 is a GM-less RPG where 3-5 players are part of a crew making a B-Movie. The crew collaborates on the framework of a science fiction, horror, or adventure movie before producing a film in three acts. Players then choose one of the following roles in the movie's production:

Director (Required)
Location Scout
Lead Actor (Required)
Supporting Actor
Stunt Person

Players then film the scenes in each act (usually two or three) by taking turns to say what they're doing in each scene. If the action seems difficult, they must roll 2d6 to determine the result.

10+: Action is a success (Ex: Lead actor delivers a great performance)
7-9: Action is successful but there's a complication (Ex: Location Scout gets the beach they wanted but there's turtles everywhere)
6-: The movie has a disaster (Ex: Director couldn't get prop guns and actors now must fight killer birds with coat hangers)

After all three acts are completed, the movie is released and the group discusses if it was a huge success, box office bomb, or film that is so bad it's a cult classic.

# To Erase and Re-Record, Press Three...
```
A voicemail game for two, unfolding as a series of missed connections.
Give yourselves names, relationship, locations. 
Each has a need the other doesn't fulfill, at least initially.
Maybe your characters talk or see each other in person, we hear only the messages...
Write your greeting.  Each call begins this way.  Greetings may change over time.
Messages could be years apart.  Maybe in tight clusters. 
To initiate each message, the listener pushes the playback button on their imaginary machine. Enact or narrate moments before if desired.  React as you listen.  
There's no particular turn order for calling. 
After messages, sender recites: "Beeeeep. To accept your message, push One. To delete your message push Two. To erase and re-record your message push Three".  
Listener controls senders choice!  Indicate numbers silently with fingers.  Four signals an accidental send. 
Each delete or re-record, sender takes a token.  Spend five to introduce a new development!
When re-recording say it differently or say something different. When re-listening adjust your reactions.  The last message becomes real.  
Maximum of 2 re-records or deletes in a row. Break this rule sometimes. 
Cut short greetings and directions whenever appropriate. 
Continue to a satisfying denouement.  
Epilogue:  What becomes of you?

# Code Past Present Future
```
Storytelling now controls the future of the world; the first AI must have its own memories.  Players portray software and sociology EXPERTS - each with their own agenda - attempting to collaboratively construct this first AI's memories.
One player may instead optionally be selected as ARBITER to ensure fairness.  Otherwise, all players function as the ARBITER together.
First, the ARBITER assigns all EXPERTS secret objectives (e.g. "Restore the Illuminati to power").
The EXPERTS then take turns, starting from the Unix Epoch (Jan 1, 1970), describing one event that they give the AI as a memory.  These events may be made up, but a two-thirds majority veto forces the player to use a historical event instead.
This event is then written down (into MEMORY).  Play repeats until a date set by the ARBITER is reached (default: 2040).
At the end of the game, the players reveal their secret objectives and the ARBITER decides how much each event in MEMORY supports each player's objective by awarding STRONG INFLUENCE, WEAK INFLUENCE, or no influence.
Afterwards, all EXPERTS roll 1d6 for every STRONG INFLUENCE and 1d4 for every WEAK INFLUENCE they have.  The player with the highest roll wins and narrates the future.

# **Hard Reset**

In the ruins of a rainy city, humans hide in the shadows, trying to survive.  Why did their world fall?  Why are they hiding? And what should you - their former robot servants - do now?

Player characters are robots, each beginning with two 'Modules' which each represent one of the game's stats:
Manipulators: ability to physically operate things
Drive Power: ability to sustain damage and exertion
Empathy: ability to feel and understand emotions 
Subterfuge: ability to tell and detect falsehoods
Logic: ability to reason and persuade
Information Processing: ability to sense, understand and remember

Rolls are made with D8s.  The GM sets a target number from 1 to 8 (low for easy, high for hard).  At least one die matching or beating the target indicates success.  Robots with no modules relevant to the task roll D8.  Robots with a relevant module roll 2D8.  The GM should reward players who roleplay using their modules (or the lack of them) with an extra D8.

Robots can find and install additional modules during the game (often as a reward for achieving tasks). A robot which takes damage loses a module.  A robot with no modules is, in a manner of speaking, dead...

# Can't Teach an Old Bot New Tricks
```
Players split evenly into "robots" and "scientists" in matched pairs. The scientists give each other goals based on objects around the room and other robots. Each scientist writes INSTRUCTIONS on paper as a list of ACTIONS and REACTIONS, each with a single target. When everyone is ready each scientist gives the instructions to their robot partner. Robots and scientists can't communicate except through INSTRUCTIONS and REPORTS.

The robots follow their instructions as well as is possible, stopping when they accomplish the goal or hit an impossible action. When everyone has finished they return to the scientists and REPORT whether they accomplished the goal, or what instruction they got stuck on. The scientists update instructions and a new round begins. If a scientist's robot accomplished their goal, they get a new goal. Repeat for a total of four rounds.

Example ACTIONS:
Sit
Stand
Pick up TARGET
Put down held item on TARGET
Smile at TARGET

Example REACTIONS:
Item was offered -> ACTION
Item was taken -> ACTION
Bumped into robot -> ACTION

All players should stop to discuss safety out of game any time there's a potentially dangerous or awkward action.
