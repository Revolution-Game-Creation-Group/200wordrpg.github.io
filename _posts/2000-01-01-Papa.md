# The Kraken's Tentacles
```
The Kraken's Tentacles 

Set up: 
Players each have eight dice in front of them representing for player one, eight sailors in his crew, for player two, eight tentacles of the Kraken.
Each dice starts with its highest value facing up. 
Player one begins a tale of the brave sailors, from any era on any seas.
Then player 2 begins a tale of the deadly Kraken. 

Story telling phase;
Player one chooses to add to the story of the sailors or the Kraken, which ever perspective he chooses he may roll one dice belonging to that character. Where it lands is the new value for that dice.
The next player does the same process choosing either perspective for herself. 
New story segments must pick up where the last left off.
Story segment should be exiting and end on a cliff hanger or decision point.

Attack phase;
Both players add up the numbers shown face up on their dice. Whoever has the most gets to subtract the difference from their opponents dice in any combination. If a dice is reduced to zero it is removed from the game.

End:
The game ends when one player's dice are all reduced to zero.

# Kids These Days
```
Choose a decade. You're all teens from that decade, and you're going to a party. You all know each other, even if you don't like each other. Tonight is a night where lives can change.
Figure out who you are, and "What's Up": what you want to accomplish at the party. You also need to determine your "Drama" - that's what's going wrong in your life. 
Everyone roll a D6. Highest roll goes first. They pick a song that reflects their character and fits the decade. It gets added to the playlist. 
Keep doing that until there are twelve songs on the playlist. Shuffle it.
When everyone is ready, they each grab 2d6. Hit play on the music. 
During one of the songs you chose, you are the GM for the length of the song. You can introduce new problems, run the other attendees at the party, and create challenges.
Whenever you try to do something, you roll 2d6. You have to roll equal to or more than the number of songs remaining. If you fail, it's because of your Drama, so you're going to have to act out. 
When the music ends, narrate an epilogue.

# Black Iron Brigade
```
Barbarians have invaded from the North! The Black Iron Brigade gathers to push back the invaders to the mountain pass from whence they came.

One player is a Traitor, determined by card draw (if Joker).

Each player:
- Commands a unit of cavalry, archers, swordsmen or spearmen 
---- Give a name, short description to the unit's origins (race, culture, etc).

- Starts with one Artifact of Trust, preferably a real item

==========================================================================================
Five Encounter Cards are placed face-down, representing the path to the main barbarian host. Encounter types are:

Hearts: Villages. Describe your passage.
Spades: Battles. Suggest a strategy.
Clubs: Crossings. Suggest a way to cross.
Diamonds: Uneventful. Share campfire stories.

Players vote for best story every encounter; winner earns an Artifact from a pile. Also, players can give Artifacts to other players whose stories they liked; describe the Artifacts and why you give them. 
==========================================================================================

The Traitor reveals themselves on the last Encounter. Players who have not given their Artifacts away lose them. Traitor rolls d6, describes their resentment towards one player, who also rolls a d6. Losers lose an Artifact. Continue until each player has been fought. The side with more Artifacts left wins and narrates the climax and outcome of the war.

# Spin Team
```
Being the president is hard. Being their press secretary might be harder.

Everyone writes two headlines (scandals,accomplishments, etc.) and throws them into a hat.

One player in this game starts as the press secretary for the most controversial and polarizing president ever. Everyone else acts as reporters for opposing media. 

The press secretary draws a headline from the hat, reads it aloud, and has to make a statement defending the president's role in the headline. After the statement each reporter may ask up to three questions. The secretary must address them all. A reporter may add a detail to the headline's story instead of asking a question. Reporters should record the secretary's answers. If a reporter catches an inconsistency, they get an extra question/detail.The secretary pulls one more headline and the process is repeated.

The press secretary gets fired and replaced by the next player. Reporters may ask about or add to previous headlines, but players only get three of these until a new headline is read or they catch inconsistencies. Repeat this until everyone has been secretary.

You can decide on a winner, but no one gets to keep their job.

# It's Personal
```
You're all red handed; sinners by trade and apart from the world. One of you fucked up. They explain who they slighted and how. The slighted explains why they cannot forgive the slight; the price must be blood. Everyone else say why they won't allow the unavenged death of someone who's spoken.

Everyone choose what you wield and what sways you:
Mortality. Propriety. Sentimentality. Cash.

Start with three gold.

Together, tell the story of how it all goes down. Share the spotlight and who gets to say what.

Spend gold anytime to have hardware, a connection, or put 2d4 goons in someone's way.

When you try to kill someone take 1d6 plus:
+1d6 if your hardware's features aid you.
-1d6 if your hardware's features hinder you.
+1d6 for each injury they have.
Roll the d6s, keep the highest.
On 6, you kill them.
On 4-5 they gain an injury.
On 1-3 you gain an injury.


When you bargain with someone, speak as your character and try swaying them by invoking what you wield. Remember what sways you. If things aren't resolving, just murder them.

It's all over when everyone is satisfied or dead.

# A Haunted House
```
Gather all players around a Ouija board.

> Setup

On a shared card, each Ghost writes the name of their spirit, a Personal Item in the House related to their life or death, and whether their spirit is Good or Evil. This card is for Ghosts only.

On a second card, write which Rooms the Ghosts reside in. Give this card to the Visitors.

> Play

Visitors go from Room to Room in the House. To ask a question, a Visitor and ALL Ghosts place their fingers on the Ouija's planchette. Only the Ghost in the same Room as the Visitor may answer.

Visitors can RELEASE a Ghost by bringing their Personal Item to the correct Room. A Released Ghost manifests and can have a moment of direct interaction with the Visitors, such as speaking to, touching, or attacking the Visitors.

Visitors can BANISH a Ghost by throwing their Personal Item into the Fireplace or bringing their Personal Item to the Room of another Ghost (even accidentally). A Banished Ghost falls silent.

> Visitor Motivations

Why are you here? A few suggestions:

- CHILD (neutral, suggestible)
- FAMILY (seeking specific spirit)
- LIBERATOR (release all spirits)
- PRIEST (banish evil)
- VILLAIN (release evil)
- SHOPKEEPER (steal Personal Items)

# Champion Battlegrounds
```
A card game where each champion card has numbers on four sides and four corners that equal to a sum of 40 but no single number is greater than 9. Champion cards are placed on a seven by seven grid with a flag in the middle. The player that starts first will place one of their champions on the side or corner to the flag to capture it and place beads of the same color on top of the champion and flag to show they own it. The next player can place their champion on the side or corner of a champion or flag they don't own. When a champion card is placed on a side or corner of an enemy champion with a lower number that enemy champion switches over to the player's side and they place their colored bead on top, this can occur to multiple enemy champions in one turn. Each player continues placing champion cards on the grid until they run out and the player with the most colored beads on the grid wins. Champion cards can be shuffled and split between 2 or more players.

# FOREST MOTHER: Motherhood in a dangerous wood
```
You are a Forest Mother and the Forest is in danger. Protect the Forest through your guardians.

Mother's have a deck (2-10 of a suit) to represent their time. Choose which guardians get your time by assigning cards.

Youngest mom first; continue clockwise

Your turn:

Assign your GUARDIANS to DANGERS. Combine cards against one DANGER or split up.
CLAIM and discard 1 random leftover card of your suit per DANGER overcome.
Discard cards used against DANGERS.

DANGERS:
Describe the conflict. Roll 2d6-WEAKNESS vs cards+TRAITS.
Roll equal to or lower: DANGER overcome, Assigned GUARDIANS develop 1 TRAIT.
Roll higher: DANGER persists, Assigned GUARDIANS suffer DOUBT and develop 1 TRAIT. 

Make excuses to prevent DOUBT by removing a random card from your deck. GUARDIANS with DOUBT are lost when they fail to overcome a DANGER.

# The Widening Gyre
```
Each player embodies one of the Families who rule the world from behind the scenes. Distribute ten points among Arcane, Science, Power, Secrecy, and Manipulation. Name the Family head. Choose a city as a base.

Your Friendship towards each other Family is 6. When another Family tries to harm yours, roll 1d6. If the roll is equal or less than your Friendship towards them, subtract 1 from your Friendship. Floor is 1.

Their Friendship towards you is their business. They track it separately.

Take turns doing things, rooted in the fiction. Mechanical effects can include:

- adding 1 to a stat (subtract 1 if you fail)
- making another Family's stat unusable for a cycle
- moving your base
- developing a speciality (+1 to a specific fictional type of thing)
- doing something else cool with a game result that matches the fictional result

To do a thing, choose two stats and roll 1d6. If you roll under the total, succeed. To defend against a thing, add one of your stats to the total they rolled.

Add or subtract 1 if you're doing things in your base city. 

If a Family's stat sum (excepting Friendships) is under 6, the Family dies.

FOUR: Your ex-lover is (pick 1): crying, muttering, raging. What does he say?

THREE: Try to talk him down. What do you say? It never works. Describe his gun as he pulls it out.

TWO: Do you threaten to leave? If so, say it and proceed. If not, go back to SEVEN. 

ONE: Why were you leaving him? Does the bullet hurt? Describe the darkness. Is it warm? Cold? Regretful? Vengeful? Everything disappears. Go back to EIGHT.

# Shelter From The Storm (Bob Dylan's RPDream)
```
Bob Dylan shivers in his bed
A Storm ravages his dreams 
Casting them as Creatures Void of Form 
Into a Little Hilltop Village 

She calls sweetly from somewhere far Beyond: 
"Come in," She says. "I'll give you Shelter..."

Sit in a circle 
Around a kitchen knife 
Describe and draw the Hilltop Village -
Its landmarks, villagers

Draw Bob Dylan 
Give him 3 sleep tokens 
When they're gone, he awakens

If the Creatures cannot enter Shelter 
Before Bob Dylan wakes 
He will never write again

Without Form, Creatures cannot 
Ask She questions 
Or enter Shelter

Nor can they enter 
With Obstacles in their path


Begin.

She: Choose your Shelter - specific landmark or villager. 
Whisper it to The Storm.

The Storm: Describe an Obstacle the Creatures now face - villager or environmental.

The Creatures: Assume Form. Describe it. 
Shed it anytime to bypass an Obstacle. 

Anytime: She may spin the knife - calling to the Creatures. 
When the knife points to: 

The Storm, or no one - Thunder, removing a sleep token; or, describe another Obstacle.

A Creature - Ask She one question about her Shelter, or to give you a new Form.

She - Sing, replenishing the sleep tokens; or, pose a riddle: 
"My Shelter is like ______".

Easy: 4 lines
Average: 8 lines
hard: 10 lines

count up all the lines they've got up through the game. If they have a good/bad thing, then that's +1/-1 line, but DON'T count it/take it away from the amount you're counting!

# BUG
```
You're a bug. What does it mean to be free, if we're enslaved by our nature? Three to six players.

One d6 dice / player
Hexagonal game mat
Garbage

-----

Character sheet:
Love:
Hate:
Purpose: ooo

-----

Scatter dice onto the map, turning the 'six' side facing up, each for a player and their starting health. Everyone selects two pieces of garbage out of the trashcan - a loved trash and a hated trash. Your hated trash must be larger, and both pieces must fit in one hand. Scatter everyone's trash on the grid. Like you, it's just organic matter.

On your turn, move exactly as many spaces as your health to a new space, no sharing spaces. End your turn as the only player adjacent to your loved trash, add one purpose 'o'. End on a space adjacent to your hated trash, scratch off one purpose. If both apply, nothing changes.

You may fight any bug in an adjacent space once per turn. When fighting, both players reduce health by one. If you go below one health, you die. There are no winners in combat, only survivors.

Collect ten purpose, you reproduce and die. With your purpose fulfilled, the game ends. You "win."

Babble On is a magical place. Everything is support, friendship, love. Any number gather in a circle, on Discord, anywhere-voice or text.

Decide on a turn order: Left around a circle, top-to-bottom in a channel, with dice...whatever.

When it's your turn, announce one, and answer the prompt:
- #all-talk: What don't they know about you?
- #tv-and-film: What are you digging right now?
- #the-table: What RPG is rattling inside you?
- #speak-that: What's troubling you?
- #the-gallery: What have you seen that stunned you?
- #sweet-jams: What song is playing in your head?
- #reading-news: What's got your attention?
- #original-sin-den: What do you desire? How thirsty are you?

End your turn with a tag:
- /rant: No one can reply. You say your piece.
- /advice: In order, everyone has the option of giving advice, or their own suggestion.
- /support: In order, everyone has the option of lending support, but no advice.
- None: In order, anyone can say anything on the subject. 

When turn order returns to the start, hand off to the next person.

Have a drink of water; stay hydrated! Hug it out if needed/wanted.

We begin again. New turns can't reference old turns.

We play until content.

# Shame
```
Take off your clothes. Dim the lights and draw the curtains.

Find two coins. Lie flat on your back on the floor before carefully placing each of the coins over each of your closed eyelids. Count to ten. Breathe deeply.

Something happened to you.

Where is the pain?

HEAD (Accusation)
THROAT (Secret)
HEART (Trauma)
BELLY (Regret)
GROIN (Disgrace)
LEGS (Contempt)

Toss a coin to your left.

HEADS
Rehearse a grandiose and arrogant reaction to your shame.
Spent a moment demanding envy and appreciation.

TAILS
You're oversensitive, hypervigilant, easily hurt.
Spent a moment accusing someone of being abusive toward you.

Stop here if you want to win the internet.

Now lean to your right to toss the second coin.

HEADS
Relive the MEMORY that caused your shame. Now suppress it: bury it deep down inside yourself. Your shame is contagious every time you become angry. 

TAILS
Relax into the pain in your BODY. Rationalise the pain: it's just a sensation. Your shame is contagious every time you think of another person as being inherently bad.

Unless you choose differently.

Take ten deep breaths. Put on your clothes, draw the curtains; go outside. Every naked piece of you is beautiful.

# It's For My Niece's Wedding
```
3-6 players

Deal six notecards.
Players write descriptions of objects on five.

Each object has:
Name
Utility - (baking, lubrication...)
Costs - ($75, dignity...)
Size - (get creative...)
Description - (flammable, stretchy...)

Collectors win when they have three objects all matching category (expensive, portable, useful in rain...)

Shuffle objects into a deck. Reveal three objects as the "yardsale."

Take turns clockwise, player with smallest pockets starts.

On your turn, choose one:
-Take a yardsale object. Explain why you want it. If someone has another card that fits that desire, they may trade it for another of your cards that you pick. Left of you has first dibs. If you have four objects, yardsale one. Otherwise, yardsale top of deck.

-Draw an object from the deck. If you have four objects, trash a yardsale card, and replace with one of yours.

-Say any player's category (including self). If you are correct, you keep any one of their objects. They trash remaining objects and write new category. Reveal goal only if correct. 

If deck is empty, shuffle trashed objects into deck.
Play until someone finishes their category.

# Nascence
```
Nascence is a game about creation for 4-10,000 players.

We are Powers, omnipotent creative forces with the ability to write the rules of reality. 

Initially, Powers are equally matched. None may triumph over another or enforce their will alone. 

Thus, there is one law: consensus. 

There must be a first decision. Whatever it is, it must be made collectively and with consent of all. 

Nothing exists - fictionally or within the rules of the game - that has not been created by Powers, either through consensus or whatever processes they put in place. Even the boundaries of the game, and the mechanisms that govern it, only exist as a product of the dialogue between Powers and the agreement to continue. 

The game begins properly once the first decision has been made, and ends at a point determined by the decisions and creations of the Powers. 

The Powers may need to address other questions: 
How do we interact with existence?
How do we resolve conflicts?
What do we seek? 
Do we have purpose? 
When does the game end? 

Each decision should be recorded, and struck from the record if it ceases to be true. 

At all times, consensus is the first law.

# My Brother's Keeper
```
A game for two players. One plays CAIN, the other ABEL. You're siblings, but your names, genders, and other details are open-ended.

ABEL, describe your world.

CAIN, this world is changing. How?

ABEL has narrative authority over "the old." CAIN, over "the new."

ABEL defines what is evil and reviles it. CAIN defines what is good but struggles to do it.

You were taught these by THE FATHER, the giver of life. ABEL, who or what is THE FATHER? CAIN, why do you respect THE FATHER?

Co-narrate and roleplay the following scenes. Interpret these prompts freely. Your areas of authority decide who plays NPCs, makes judgment calls, etc.

I. ABEL's in trouble. CAIN helps.

II. CAIN sins against THE FATHER. ABEL intercedes for CAIN.

III. CAIN and ABEL each sacrifice for the sake of THE FATHER.

IV. THE FATHER accepts ABEL's sacrifice but rejects CAIN's.

V. CAIN becomes incensed with ABEL. ABEL only makes things worse.

VI. CAIN murders ABEL.

ABEL, your blood cries out. What does this mean?

CAIN, how is your punishment greater than you can bear?

ABEL, CAIN will live, for if CAIN is killed, they will be avenged sevenfold. What is CAIN's legacy?

# Honestly this character limit is a little too
```
In preparation, please remove your socks and shoes. Feel the carpet, hardwood, or grass under your feet.

You're a frazzled game designer strapped for ideas. When you finish reading this, you have one minute to think up a pitch for a game (use your phone's timer). During this time, your friends will stare at you silently.

After you have a pitch, attempt to convince your friends. They will be unreceptive. They will poke holes in your idea. They will put airquotes around 'constructive' criticism. They will tell you you should've gotten a real job at the shoe factory.

Defend your game, circumvent their problems, convince them of how fun it will be. Be creative. No matter how bleak it seems, there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm not just saying that because survivorship bias means I'll never know that that light only exists for a teeny tiny fraction of people.

When you give up, repeat this process until every player has gotten over being creative.

If you propose this game as your pitch, your friends should remind you that metahumor is the lowest form of comedy, before beating you to death with your own shoes.

# Kinda Shady, Morally Speaking (Breaking Bad)
```
You play two partners moving from legitimate employment into crime, the moral rules they make for themselves, and why they ultimately break them.

Pick or roll:
One-Burglary, robbery
Two-Fraud, money laundering
Three-Extortion, contract violence
Four-Bribery, corruption
Five-Narcotics
Six-Sex work

Pick legitimate employment that lends itself to such crime.

Alternate asking leading questions ('yes/no' answers) about your characters, what led them to crime, what each partner contributes.

Write a few moral rules (stuff you won't do for crime). One rule must be "I won't betray my partner".

The game is several conversations in which you establish what pushed each character to break their rules.

Pick a rule. The partners begin sitting together, like in a diner or car, just after the rule was broken.

Speak only in character. Imply actions rather than narrating them.

Begin with "Are you going to say anything?"

"I don't want to talk about it," signals you want more leading questions.

When it's clear why the rule was broken, end the conversation with "I've got to go."

Discard the rule or qualify it e.g "unless my life is at stake". 

Repeat until all rules are discarded. Leave "I won't betray my partner" until last.

# Memory-Keeper of Stars
```
Needed:
Blank sheets of paper
A writing utensil
A flashlight

On a cloudless, clear and starry night, go out to the nearest park. Make yourself comfortable. Start counting stars. 

At each point, stop and listen. Imagine the star is communicating with you. Record the memory on a sheet of paper. Fold the paper and set it aside. Continue counting.

On the sixth star: a message of musical ferocity, lilts and grace notes and sparking defiance. 

On the thirty-second star: a message of grief - a snapshot of sadness, a loss too great to be contained in one solar system. 

On the fifty-fourth star: a message of brusque serenity - the calm before the storm, the hushed silence before the charge at dawn. 

On the seventy-eighth star: a message of rebirth - the gravity of revolution, the inevitability of change, the joy of destruction to rebuild. 

On the hundred-and-first star: a message of love - a wholeness within self that reaches out to others.

Your training as a memory-keeper is now complete. Continue for as long as you see fit. Your instincts will tell you when to stop and what deserves recording.

You are a dog in a mech suit. You know dog stuff: having fun, eating food, and fighting.

You're a good dog and were trained to fight.

Since the nights of scary thunder, food is scarce and petting peoples are gone.  This burnt-smell world has bad dogs in mech suits and confusing creatures.

Dogs have:

### Three Favorites:

 * Food
 * Fun
 * Fight

 Spread seven points across, minimum one.

### Five Things: 

 * Treats
 * Toys
 * Threats

 Describe one of each plus two more.

### Three breed Natures: 

 Two positive adjectives, one negative.

Play with, eat, or fight others.  Think like a trained dog.

Roll as many dice as points in appropriate Favorite (Food is determination, Fight is aggression, Fun is socialization).  Add or remove one for Nature.  Add one if using Things.

Using highest die: One to Three is failure with setback (using negative Nature blocks *this* setback).  Four is success. Five or Six is success with advantage and/or inflicts setback.

Three setbacks removes a Favorite point.  Lost all?  You go to the petting peoples.

Creatures getting enough setbacks become food, friends, or fallen.

Play like a dog once between other events.  Roll Fun, recovering a lost Favorite point and removing setbacks on Success.
