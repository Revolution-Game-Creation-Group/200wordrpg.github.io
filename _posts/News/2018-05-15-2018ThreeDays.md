# Submissions Open in Three Days

Rules and details can be found on the main site: https://200wordrpg.github.io/

The Goal: Design a tabletop role-playing game using 200 words or less.

**Impossible you say? Not so!**

In fact it's the perfect challenge to try out some new ideas. A 200 word limit will put your editing and writing skills to the test. 

And yet it's a project you could complete in just a few days. No need to write hundreds of pages with artwork, layout, and marketing. Just writing. Intense, brutal writing.
