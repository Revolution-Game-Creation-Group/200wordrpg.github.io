# Exclusive: Gold Leaf and Broadsheets
```
One player is a Dictator. They should come up with a title, a country, and a general personality. They should also pick a number of Items from the list below (=Journalists + 1) to be present in their stronghold.

The other players are Journalists. They should come up with names for themselves, as well as the publications they represent. Each Journalist also picks an Item from the list below. This Item intimidates them.

The Dictator invites the Journalists into their home for an exclusive interview. While the Journalists may ask any question of the Dictator with impunity, they are not immune to being intimidated. If a Journalist is annoying the Dictator, they may describe an Item in their stronghold, trying to intimidate the Journalists. Any Journalist who is intimidated can only fawn and flatter for the rest of the game.

Game ends when the Dictator gets bored of the Journalists.

# The search for the Grail
```
King Arthur is dead.
You are the last Knight of the Round Table.
Find the Grail and save Britain.

RULES:

3-7 players

Choose Knight's name
Choose a virtue: Prudence, Courage, Temperance, Justice.
Each player choose a Capital Sin: Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, Pride

A player is God: his role is to set the scene. 
The player to its left is the Knight: his role is to follow his virtue.
Other players are Adversities: their role is to make the scene interesting, tempt the Knight playing their sin.

Knight and Adversities can interact freely for 20 minutes, then God shall call its judgement. Roll 1D6, +2 if the Knight followed his virtue, -1 for each sin that tempted him.

4+: The Knight stayed strong. Success
3-: The Knight faltered. Failure

God shall close the scene describing the aftermath.

Another scene will start and the roles will switch counterclockwise.

END:

After a full round the Knight will find the Grail.

Answer as a group: What is the Grail? Where was it?

Successes > Failures -  How will it save Britain? How will the Knight be remembered?

Failures > Successes -  How will it destroy Britain? How will the Knight die?

# Zombies in Hell
```
Hell is a dark reflection of the living world, only with zombies. You're dead, but not a zombie ...yet. Avoid demons. Flee to the wastes. Gather resources. Stake a claim.

----------

Everyone make a separate character/group. Share spotlight. Let conflict emerge. Worldbuild together. Rotate GMing. 

GM gets a deck of cards. Each player gets a hand of ten to represent resources: steel (spades), souls (hearts), safety (diamonds), zombies/the will not to be a zombie (clubs). Make the resources specific. Declare one thing renewable and one thing you're missing. Everyone different. Trade, steal or forge to get what you need.

----------

Conflicts: Agree on big-picture stakes and goals. Narrate fiction each time you:

* Lay a card face-down: to show/risk what you got;
* Turn a card face-up: to take action with it;
* Take a face-down card back: to withdraw it;
* Take a face-up card back: to de-escalate or mitigate (the fiction/opponent permitting)
* Resolve what's down: only when there's no other choice.

(No strict turn order: be fair and use the fiction.)

High poker hand wins. "Winner" burns half of what's still down. Loser loses all of what's still down. Winner narrates it. Re-draw hands with updated resources as fictionally established.

# Amnesiac Deathtrap: A Game of Identity
```
Player Characters (PCs) wake up with amnesia. An Evil Mastermind (EM) has captured them, and will test them against dangerous challenges, deadly traps, and hard choices in a life-or-death game.

PCs begin with two Protagonist Points and one memory - "My name is ______". Write this down.

When challenged, PCs roll a d6.
6 = Success, recover a memory.
4-5 = Success.
2-3 = Failure, suffer an injury.
1 = Failure, lose a memory.

If one PC is challenging another, the challenger rolls. Define what "success" and "failure" mean before the roll.

Any player can spend a Protagonist Point to re-roll any die once, including forcing other players to reroll.
PCs are awarded Protagonist Points after betraying another PC, causing them to suffer an injury or lose a memory.

When a PC recovers a memory, they write down the memory.
When a PC loses a memory, they cross it out.
When a PC has no memories left, they die.
When a PC has suffered 5 physical injuries, they die.
When a PC has regained 5 memories, they will remember how to escape the deathtrap. They must succeed at one final challenge to escape...but what kind of person have they become?

# Wank-Breaker
```
Wank-breakers fight The Wank, the power that seeds the world with dungeons and villains.

To do something, roll a d6.

1: Enemy crits you (their damage explodes).
2: You take 1d6 damage.
3: An exchange of damage.
4 or 5: Damage your enemy; a 5 gives you a stunt too.
6+: You may crit, stunt, add another target, or another die to this attack. Reroll this die.

"Enemy" means any problem. Enemies have one or more d6 HD. 


PCs have 1d6 HP to start and regain all HP after each scene. 0 HP kills, petrifies, ensorcelles, or makes one give up, etc. as appropriate.

Generate a damn PC: Fighter (+2 dmg vs flesh), Wizard (+1d6 to spells), Sharper (four +2 dmg skills). Name/describe 2 "near" abilities and one "far". Only spells can heal others.

Stunts are extras you can add to an action with a 5 or 6. They could be pushes, trips, disarms, called-shots etc.

To gain anything (stat boost, more HD, bigger dice, etc.), you must find a narrative way to take it (eat a demon's heart, etc).

There are 2 ranks to each side when fighting. Far rank is impossible without allies.

# I Can Haz Food?
```
 === INTRODUCTION ===

You are a cat and you are hungry. You suddenly smell food and turn the corner of an alley to find some other cats have done the same. All of you gather and begin to plot.

 === PREPARATION ===

Using small tokens, give each player three to start their collection and add three more to the central Food Pile. Add three additional tokens to the Food Pile per player for a minimum of three and up to a maximum of six total players.

 === PLAY ===

Play starts with the player who last ate food and proceeds clockwise.

On their turn, the player must consume (remove from play) one token from either:
their own collection; 
the central Food Pile; or
any other player's food collection.

If a player no longer has food in their own collection, even on another player's turn, they are out of the game. Play continues until only one cat remains.

 === STRATEGY ===

Remember: hungry cats don't share food! You can play conservatively, but other players may not. They may even turn on you! Alliances can be formed and broken at any time. 

Only one cat can win!

# Publish or Perish
```
The 23rd Multinational Medical Symposium has begun, but a spreading pathogen threatens the future of global healthcare...

Each player gets a card and a pawn. From high downwards, say your name, field, and quirk.

Lowest card? You're sick.

Build the Disease Track: 5 facedown cards.

ALWAYS:
When sick: Put your pawn on first track card.
When on a facedown card: Flip it and describe that step's symptoms.

EACH DAY: Sick pawns advance a card. Those already at the end die.
Everyone picks one:

 - RESEARCH: Draw a card. Describe your findings.
 - TREAT: Discard a card whose suit matches the track. Move someone's pawn back a step, say how you help. If the card's 7+, you're sick.
 - COLLABORATE: Swap hands with someone. Keep a card and swap back. If one was sick, both are now.
 - PUBLISH: Play a card faceup and gain 1 prestige. If its suit matches the track, you're sick.
 - CURE: Secretly look at the entire track. If your hand plus PUBLISHED cards forms a poker hand better than the track's, you find a cure; gain 5 prestige and everybody can TREAT without discarding. If not, discard your hand.

AFTER 7 DAYS, most prestige is celebrated; dead are mourned.

# DOWNER! THE WITCH'S PET KAIJU
```

Storytelling about friendship between Emma Tetra, teen witch, and Downer, a giant monster:
You need index cards and markers. 
Take five index cards. On one write GOAL;  another write MISS BEHAVE; another TRAGEDY; another INTIMACY; the fifth SUCCESS. The 5 cards start the deck. Shuffle them. Place words down.
Take turns drawing a card and adding story. For each card, describe Emma's experience related to the card. If you draw GOAL, describe Emma acquiring a new goal, a vision--maybe reinvestment in old objectives. Same when MISS BEHAVE's drawn, describe Downer miss behaving. For TRAGEDY, describe a TRAGEDY happening. Make sure the storytelling plays in shared narrative created by players before you. For INTIMACY, intimate moment between Emma and Downer. For SUCCESS, Emma achieves a goal or something good happens to them. When no cards are left, the next player writes a new event, abstract or concrete, on a clean index card (Examples: "ENTERS EXTRA DIMENSION", "IRONY", or "DEVELOPS CRUSH"). Shuffle card in with the deck, put all cards words down, and the next player draws from top, and the game loops with a new card being added each round. 
Game ends when a THE END card's created and drawn.

# Innovative Resolution Mechanics
```
The players agree on a world they want to explore: Greyhawk, Star Trek, France, whatever. In this setting lives an elderly woman named Esther who must go on an adventure to accomplish her goal. The first player decides what her goal is, then passes control of Esther.

Whenever the result of Esther's actions are in doubt, the player whose turn will be next must come up with a new resolution mechanic: rolling a die, drawing a card, guessing how many beans are in a jar, whatever. The previous player decides what constitutes success: rolling higher than a 5, drawing a club, guessing within 4 beans of the correct amount. 

No resolution mechanic may ever be used more than once, even across multiple sessions. Control of Esther passes to a new player after 1 success, or 3 failures, whichever comes first.

# Blossoms Whisper, Blades Sing, for 4-8 bushi
```
Requires a set of Hanafuda cards

Everyone in attendance is a high ranking samurai in the service of an ambitious lord. You have gathered for a cherry blossom viewing party, to drink wine, compose poetry and cement a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Assign five points to yourself in two categories: Civility and Savagery.

Deal all the cards to all players face down. A player who receives a kiri is a Shogunate spy. 

Return the cards, shuffle and deal four cards to each player. The party begins. When a player takes an action against another player, compare values in the appropriate category, the higher result achieves their goal. NPC's are improvised by the player to your left.
You may spend cards on an action. Add one point per card, or double your Savagery value if you play an animal, Civility if you play a ribbon. Draw back to four after you are done.

If at any point you have completed a full seasonal set, you may spend it to ask any player a question which they must answer honestly.
Cryptic answers are best.
The conspirators win if they unmask and kill all spies. Any other result is a Shogunate win.

# Millennials Ruin Everything!
```
Eight round accessible larp for up to eight players. Millennials dismantle oppressive systems; online play friendly.

Materials: 
-Pen, paper. If participant is unable to draw (physical limitations), a volunteer may assist. 
-Match(es).
-Fire-safe bucket.
-Water (for emergency, hydration).

One person plays a millennial Speaker (facilitator/leader). Others portray millennial elected officials. 

The player who last paid a government tax, toll, or fine goes first.

The Speaker moderates each round. Length of each round determined by participants. Each participant must propose dismantling of 1+ institution (see list below). Speaker may use stopwatch/timer. Participants are encouraged to replace oppressive institutions with more specific establishments (corrupted democratic republic, failing healthcare system) or those affecting them directly.

Each round may only continue when participants agree upon a solution for ruining that round's institution.

Institutions:

-Classism
-Sexism 
-Racism
-Heteronormativity
-Ableism
-Anti-transgenderism
-Player choice
-A government structure

After each round, one participant illustrates a representation of the dismantled institution. When rounds are complete, players compile illustrations (hold up visibly if remote) and collectively burn them, shouting together "Millennials ruin everything!"  

Optional hydration mechanic: Participants may drink water after each round, representing necessary self-care and emotional labor required to dismantle these systems.

# Stitched
```
They came in a deadly whirlwind of steel and spell, annihilating all within the catacombs. In the aftermath, you awoke, gaining sentience from residual magic they'd left behind. Battered and frail, you creep forth.

Stitched is a game for 1-5 players and a GM. You'll need 8d4, 4d6, 2d12, and 1d20. The GM uses a pile of counters.

The Stitched
You are undead, weakened but sentient after tomb raiders invaded your dungeon home. You begin with 1d6 to represent your abilities. As you hunt, you'll gain dice, allowing you to attach them to your growing form by spending two similar dice: 2d4 = 1d6, 2d6 = 1d12, and 2d12 = 1d20. Each die represents a different amalgamation of necrotic flesh with a shared consciousness.


Playing the Game
The GM sets the scene, then players take turns describing their actions. Roll the dice. A 4 or more indicates success. A 1 is an injury: split the die or remove it if it's a d4. 

The GM can increase the difficulty by 1 by giving a player a token. A player can spend 2 tokens to gain 1d4.

Reap the Flesh!

# Ill Suited: A Game of Two-Sided Relationships
```
SETUP

Deal seven cards per player from a standard deck. Each player arranges three cards (left, top, and right) to indicate their relationships and one at bottom as personal outlook. Hold the other cards.

PLAY

Lowest ranked outlook goes first. On your turn draw a card, then play a card:
(1) Build relationship by playing onto your side of your relationship a card (not an Ace) matching suit * or beating rank of the other side's latest card in that relationship.
(2) End relationship by playing onto either side of any relationship an Ace matching suit * of a royal (KQJ) card that is also the latest card on that side.
(3) Change outlook by playing onto your outlook a card to replace it.

* You may always play cards matching your outlook's suit or rank.

NARRATION

During setup and play, narrate your relationships according to the cards: Hearts are emotional bonds and romance; Clubs are social affiliations and recreation; Diamonds are financial ties and family; Spades are intellectual affinities and work.

ENDGAME

Stop after three relationships end or the deck is exhausted. Praise entertaining narration, clever play, or total points (K=13, Q=12, J=11, 10-2=face value, A=0).

# No yelling in IKEA
```
this is a sad LARP
for two friends
about a couple arguing over furniture,
except maybe,
they're arguing about their relationship.

go to IKEA.

each partner says:
... one reason you know lots about interior decorating.
... one reason your partner knows less about it than you.
... how long you've been together.
... how long you've LOVED them.
... why you LOVE them.

wander the showrooms.
the person who has been in LOVE longer starts, finding an object they like, and saying why they do.
if their partner agrees, find another. if they don't agree, argue over it.
the person who brought up the object defends it until their partner gives up and leaves to the next room.
then they choose an object.

every time you make your arguments personal, whether veiled or explicit, gain a POINT. don't record or mention it, just remember your total.

when someone brings up the POINTS, both say how many POINTS you have and stop talking. walk silently to the cafeteria and sit down with your meals. on your walk, decide whether or not to apologize.

over your food, apologize or eat in silence. when one of you is done eating, the game ends.

# CAPTCHA
```
One player is the (callous, curious) SCIENTIST, the other is the (hopeful, fearful) DROID. The DROID is one of a batch of 24, designed to infiltrate humanity. The SCIENTIST is testing the DROID to see if it can pass as human. If the DROID fails the test, all 24 will be decommissioned and the SCIENTIST will start over. Both characters know this.

Set up a game of "Guess Who?"

The DROID chooses (from the deck) which of the options is its chassis. The SCIENTIST then asks yes-or-no questions of the DROID. There's a catch, however: any old robot can answer factual questions ("Are you blonde?"). The SCIENTIST is trying to tell whether the DROID can pass as human, so the SCIENTIST asks subjective questions that only a true human would be able to answer.

Examples:

"Are you beautiful?"
"Do you look angry?"
"Do you look like a muggle?"

After each question, the SCIENTIST flips down the faces that do not match the DROID's description. Play until the SCIENTIST has one or fewer faces remaining. If only the DROID's face remains upright, then the DROID has passed the test and gets released. In all other cases, the DROID has failed.

# Because of Mew
```
A game about relationships and cats
There has been a break-up. Someone is moving out. Who gets Mew?
3 players. 2 sad people. 1 frustrated cat.

People scenes: Each person has a scene with Mew to try and explain why the break-up is for the best, and confess a secret shame that they think makes them unlovable to the other person. They also try to convince Mew to live with them. Mew decides when the scene is over by leaving that person.

Mew's scenes: Describe Mew disrupting the packing. Everyone should be in these scenes. 
Sad people are negotiating who gets Mew. Mew tries to expose a shame. If Mew can get either of the people to mention anything from their shame the other sad person can demand answers and reconciliation can happen. Mew can end the scene at any time by leaving.

Mew gets two scenes to try to save its people.

The final scene ends either by celebrating with the cat, or by forcing Mew to choose which sad person it loves most.

# Lightning
```
You are in complete darkness and can not move. Your head hurts and your memories are fragmented. Next to you you hear strange noises. But then a lightning flashes and for a tiny moment your surroundings are lit up.

What have you seen? Where are you? Why you can not move? And above all, what will you do?

Mix a deck of 32 cards. Every player who says something reveals a card. 

At each 7, another flash twitches and you see something again. When all 7s have been revealed, the game ends immediately.

At each 8, the thunder superimposes all sounds - you have to communicate in a different way. 

At each 9, you listen to the strange noise. How does it sound, what could it be?

At each 10, a part of your memory comes back.

At every jack, queen and king, you describe what you do to escape from this situation.

At every ace, something unexpected happens to one of the players.
In critical situations, a coin is thrown that decides on success or failure.

# Janus: a game for three players
```
One of you is a spy. The other two are your handlers -- or claim to be. You've been hit with an experimental compound by a group that's infiltrated your agency, looking to subvert it for their own goals -- or so they say. They're saying lots of things, though. Like that the other is lying. Like that the other is an infiltrator.

You have a pounding headache. And both of them at gunpoint.

You can only manage ten questions -- ten questions to decide which of them is telling the truth about being your handler, which of them should be eliminated as a threat to your organisation. Ten questions, while the building is falling down around your ears.

When the spy has asked 5 questions, handlers each secretly flip a coin -- heads, and you're not an infiltrator. Tails, you are. Keep this secret from the other players.

Answer the final five questions as convincingly as you can.

When the spy has chosen who to believe, and who to eliminate, the still living handler should narrate briefly what happens next. Reveal if you were truly the handler, if you were lying, or if you let your comrade die to save your own skin.

# Spaghetti Pitch
```
For 1-4 players and a pot of spaghetti.

Premise: You are a group of co-founders of a startup. Your goal is to successfully launch products. You'll be throwing spaghetti to see what sticks.

As a group, answer the following questions:
- What's your industry?
- Who're your target customers?
- What's your company's name?

Make a pot of spaghetti, cook it al dente. 

Stand 5 feet away from a blank wall. 

Co-founders take turns throwing spaghetti against the wall. When you throw a piece of spaghetti, yell out a product pitch for your startup.
- If the spaghetti sticks: congratulations, you have product / market fit!
- If it temporarily sticks but then falls off: you're getting close to something good
- If it falls off immediately: no luck, describe why this product didn't work

Go around until everyone has thrown four pieces of spaghetti. Once you have one successful idea, new pitches can be adjacent products or new markets. When you're done, count up the number of successes to determine your startup's outcome:

1-2: Aqui-hired
3-4: Major Acquisition
5-6: IPO
7+: The Next Facebook!

If none of your spaghetti sticks: Your startup runs out of funding, time to apply to Google...

# But for the Grace of God
```
Your ship falls toward a singularity. You are the sole survivor in the compartment. The damage control board shows one more life sign on the far end of the ship. You pick up the intercom handset and hope for the best.
One player is the engineer, the other the pilot. Place two coins in front of each player: players select whether they are heads or tails. If you don't want to choose, flip them. Do not show the coins to the other player. As you work to find a way to survive, symbolized by the states of the coins, you talk to each other about your lives for five minutes. After that, the work you have done will succeed or not. You may change the orientation of the coins as many times as you like, but never tell the other player the result.

Result:
4H Pilot dies and engineer survives
3H1T Pilot chooses who  survives
2H2T Both die
1H3T Engineer chooses who survives
4T Engineer dies and pilot survives

Afterwards, the survivor recounts what they remember of the person who died so that they might live.

Each Chosen's story is narrated by their Fate (player). Every story begins with the mortal gazing at their reflection (location determined by the Fate). The Chosen's background determines its skills. Fates can ask brief questions or use threads to influence story direction. If the Chosen does not accomplish their goal, their Fate loses.  

When the Chosen's season ends their goal is revealed, and a new Chosen is selected. When all seasons are complete, the Fates vote for the best story.

## Rules ##

- Once a Fate uses a thread they must discard it for that season.
- Fates cannot harm the Chosen (other mortals are fair game)
- Fates must not disrupt the order of the present reality. A thread can crash a car not summon a dragon.
- Fates cannot vote for their story.
- Thread influences must match their color.
- Seasons last 7 minutes.

# Whispers in the Dark
```
Players:
1 "Blasphemer"
2+ "Whispers"
1 "The Dark"

You, the Blasphemer, awaken in the drowned corpse-city. Slowly, The Dark crawls away from you, and into the corners of your mind. Shutting your eyes, you hear them: The Whispers.

Below, an eldritch corpse waits dreaming.

Beginning each turn, The Dark rolls 3d6 to release three details to the Blasphemer, each beginning with:

"You..."
1 - "see..."
2 - "hear..."
3 - "smell..."
4 - "taste..."
5 - "feel..."
6 - "know..."

Each Whisper rolls a d12, adding the result to their "Presence". Whispers with more Presence sit closer to the Blasphemer. Whispers must always sit behind those with more Presence.

Then, the Blasphemer closes their eyes, and the Whispers each whisper commands continuously, until the Blasphemer chooses one. The Blasphemer describes their actions.

If success is uncertain, the Blasphemer closes their eyes and a die is rolled. The Blasphemer must call whether the result is "Odd" or "Even". The Whispers may whisper the result. The Blasphemer succeeds on a correct call.

The Whisper whose command was chosen has their Presence set to zero, then becomes "The Dark", and the old one becomes a Whisper. The Dark describes the result of the action.

The turn begins anew.

# Competitive Game Design
```
You and 2-3 other people are Game Designers
It is time to make a game

Write Down a Vision, it should be lofty and hard to achieve
Ex-this game will make you forgive your father, this game will teach evolution
Write down a Hard Line, it should be unreasonable
Ex-this game can have no combat, this game cannot use paper

Take turns adding your Idea to the game
When you are done explaining your Idea the other Designers can ask one question about it. Answer them honestly.
Each other Designer who feels your idea goes against their Vision or dangerously close to their Hard Line may compliment your idea and then change it to their liking, taking partial credit for the Idea.
Once all the Designers are satisfied, write down the Idea
The next Designer may now introduce their Idea


Once you have as many Ideas written down as there are Designers, the game is released.
Gain 1 Validation for elements of your Vision present in the finalized Ideas
Lose 1 Validation for each Idea that includes your Hard Line

The Designer with the most Validation is the best

# Sentience
```
The Big Bang has happened. At the dawn of a new universe, the Will of Creation passes into the cooling magma around stars. It is the beginning. And as you are the Sentience of an Entire Planet. You are the Will of a World.
Player: Each player plays as a sentient planet early on its life cycle.
Dungeon Master: The DM is the star at the central of player party's Stellar System.
Objective: The overall goal of the System (party) is to survive the next Big Crunch.
Gameplay: Player decision directs the evolution of their world. What traits they'll take - will they be a magma world, or an icy one? The traits influence the type of sentient species that will develop.
Harmonic Convergence: Players can only take action when a harmonic convergence happens every million years or so. After a group decision is made, the DM narrates how the system changes from then on.
Extra-stellar events: Every few harmonic convergence a stellar event happens that puts them in direct jeopardy. E.g. a massive meteor cluster or an invasion from a sentient space squid. Planets work together to ensure survival of most of their population.
