# Consequence, the Tyrant
```
Requires: two people, 10-30 paper slips, pens, a cup.


Together, define a LEADER:

	Who do they lead? 
	What's their GOAL? 
	What two THREATS do they face?
	What's their title and name? 
	Which do they believe is best: to be loved, feared or respected?

One person plays this LEADER, one is the NARRATOR. 

Each turn:

1) [turn 4 onwards] NARRATOR may draw a slip from the cup, narrate CONSEQUENCES they wrote, then discard.

2) NARRATOR describes recent events and presents a difficult choice or dilemma that has arisen (possibly inspired by GOAL, THREATS, previous CONSEQUENCES). LEADER asks NARRATOR three questions to explore the issue, then describes their course of ACTION.

3) Both secretly choose a number from 1-3 and reveal. NARRATOR describes short-term CONSEQUENCES based on the sum: 
	5, 2 good
	4 mixed
	3, 6 terrible

4) LEADER secretly writes the possible long-term CONSEQUENCES of their ACTION on a paper slip, then conceals by folding in half. NARRATOR writes alternative CONSEQUENCES on the slip, folds again and places in the cup.

5) Swap roles.



When LEADER no longer leads, GOAL is achieved, or blank paper slips run out, each narrate short epilogue illustrating one aspect of the LEADER's legacy.

# Cursed Chronicle
```
You are historians charting the course of a cursed Artifact through the ages. You'll need a deck of cards and up to 9 players.

Decide what the Artifact is: an item and descriptor. Give it a Boon and a Curse. Example: Silver Goblet, Wealth / Violence.

Take as many numbered cards as players, making an unbroken sequence starting with 2. Shuffle and deal one to everyone, face down.

Shuffle together all face cards and one Ace. Deal one to everyone, face down, ensuring someone gets the Ace. Never reveal yours.

You will tell the history of an Artifact Bearer. Your number represents their order in the Artifact's succession, 2 being most recent. Your face card suggests their Fate:

Hearts: Passion
Diamonds: Vice
Spades: Conflict
Clubs: Growth
Jack: Family
King: Enemy
Queen: Stranger

Take turns: Reveal your number, then describe your Bearer. Tell how:
... they acquired the Artifact,
... its Boon and Curse affected them,
... they died.

Weave a consistent chronicle of the Artifact's history.

However: the Ace-holder is the current Bearer of the Artifact, covetous of its Boon. Tell an apocryphal history of your assigned Bearer, warping the other players' histories.

At the end, players try to determine who the Bearer is.

# The Brawn Solution
```
You are a fighter or martial artist in an ancient tradition of protecting your community and bettering yourself. Wits, charm, planning -- the tactics of cowards. The only tools you have to solve any problem are your enormous, rippling muscles. Train and fight!

There are five main groups of muscles. Put +3 in one, +2 in two, and +1 in two.
Pecs: Raw strength. Lifting, pushing, flexing.
Abs: Endurance and stamina. Resistance.
Biceps (and arms): Refined muscle and discipline.
Quads (and legs): Running, jumping, and dancing.
Glutes: Booty. Embrace Eros!

	There are three possible levels of Ridiculosity. Choose one whenever you roll.
1: Action hero posing
2: Anime hero monologue
3: JRPG villain monologue

	When you set a goal and strive for it, add your Muscle to some Ridiculosity and roll that many d6s. Count the dice that come up 3 or more and consult below:
1: Make yourself happy
2: Get something done but look dumb OR impress someone but fail
3: Do something the right way, and don't even get hurt!
4: Do something that achieves your goals OR don't break anything
5: Do the right thing
6: Vindicate previous actions

# Trickster's Game
```
The treasure awaits, but the curse of the maze is just around the corner! Two voices are guiding you, but who can you trust?

Four players required to play. 
Each player takes one of the cards that determine their role. 

Roles:
2 adventurers
1 cartographer
1 trickster 

The 2 adventurers don't know who the trickster is and who the cartographer. 

The party enters a cursed maze in search for the treasure.
The maze is divided by covered tiles under.

Both the cartographer and the trickster know which tile hides the treasure, but the trickster also knows the locations of the traps.
The cartographer tries to guide the party towards treasure, while the trickster tries to guide them away while pretending to be the cartographer. The two adventurers must decide who to trust and follow.

The party moves one tile per turn in any available direction at the moment and uncovers them as they go.
There is a time limit that puts more pressure on the adventurers to decide who to trust.

If the time expires, or the party enters a trap 3 times, the trickster wins.
If the party finds the treasure, the adventurers and the cartographer win.

# A night in the life
```
2-6 players. Choose Tracy Ariel look and job.

Draw a clock and make a note on 8am. "Back at work!". Write "1" between 8 and 9. Keep numbering  till 12. 

One player throws 2d6 to see when the scene is happening, between 8pm and now.

They pick up a theme: 

- Fight
- Love
- Revenge
- Siblinghood
- Panic
- Secrets
- Monsters
- Treasure
- Vice
- Savior
- Illumination
- Karma

Set up a scene in which T.A. meets someone (known or unknown) and an Event appropriate with the theme is about to happen. Others can make questions and helping establishing facts. Then the player will play T.A and someone else the other people. When it will be unclear how the Event will turn out for T.A, throw 2d6:

1-6: this scene Theme is also pain, terror, loss or regret.
7-9: it turns out ok; next scene's theme will also be one from 1-6
10-12: this scene theme is also Healing, Success, or Quiet.

Close the scene. 

Take turns playing A.T till the clock is complete. When a hour comes up again, explore an Event's new side, in light of the new themes. Narrate an epilogue.

# Notice me Senpai
```
  
What you'll need: letter-making materials, and friends.

The roles

Senpai: you do nothing but exist. You're seemingly ordinary but all the kawaii kouhais think you're pretty kakui. They're lined up to cheer you up. So Sit back, exist, and enjoy some sweet love letter action.

Kouhais: There's several kind of kouhais. (See below). All of you are absolutely enthralled with Senpai. You want nothing more for him to recognize the unrequited love you send him and cheer him up when he's in despair.

The Rules
This is a love letter making game. Whoever last wrote a handwritten letter gets to be the Senpai first. The rest then pick a kouhai and write their love letter to Senpai. When all letters arrive, the previous Senpai chooses the next one. This can continue for as long as you like! There is no win scenario or anything like that. The only real rule is that all letters must be written in the style of the kouhai the player chose.

Types of kouhai:
Tsundere
Yandere
Dandere
Kuudere
Deredere
Himedere/oujidere
Kamidere
Sadodere

If you want to be random about it roll a d8...baka.

On the climax, draw *Red* for *fixed Positives* portrayed, the other players draw *Blacks*: three plus *unfixed Negatives* portrayed. You both play one covered card, than show it. Highest wins, you can negate the *Black* (discarded and re-played) for each achieved *Goal*. **Success**: you achieve the *Goal* and fix the relationship; **Tie**: choose one; **Failure**: you receive a bad *Stigma*. Play it out.
*Epilogue*: a short scene about your future life for each *Goal* achieved/*Stigma* received, good things from *Successes*, bad things from *Stigmas*.
Congrats, you're a grown adult now.

# The New Gods of Babel
```
You are newborn gods, shaping the physical world in your image. Existence is without until you breathe life into it. The complete Jenga Tower before the players represents this unshaped world, and what remains at the end of the game is the world you and the other gods have built together.

On your turn, you can...
    ...pull and place a block to add a new detail to the world
    ...pull and place two blocks to change a detail that another god has added
    ...remove and keep any block from the game to undo a detail added by another god
    ...remove yourself from the game, content with your place and power as a lesser god

The game ends when...
    ...all remaining players agree to stop adding details, content with the Utopia they have created
    ...the tower falls, as reality snaps from the constant bending and reforming from so many different wills, and all gods are erased from existence

Whoever pulled the last block from a standing tower is crowned King and Ruler Cosmic Above All Others
Whoever pulled the last block before the tower fell is named Eternal Shame Of The Horizon
Whoever possesses the most blocks goes first next game

# The Old Stories are Coming True, Now
```
There's magic in folktales, in embodying their characters and following their narratives and knowing their symbols. But there's danger, too.

Draw seven cards.

Tell everyone who you are.

Name:
Career:
People:
Childhood:
Two Folktales:



What's vital in this dawning age? Each of you! Everyone also names one more. From those,  you...

Love:
Fear:
Hate:
Crave:

To change the world, tell a tale.

To begin a tale, play RED into a new pile and say what you hope, and what bars you.

Anyone (including you!) may play cards and pose a trial that changes the story: you may accept the changes (and cards) into the pile, or overturn them and discard that number of cards, from your hand or pile.

Discard BLACK to ask a question.  Another gives truth: if you use it now, draw three.

When each tale is concluded, count cards and speak of your loves, fears, hates, cravings.  They, and the world, may change.  Deal out the pile and the discards, then draw three.

Several tales may unfold at once. No cards? All done.

Cards:          RED achieves the...     BLACK affects...        EITHER touches...
3               ...Heroic                          ...families, seasons    Another's mind

# Devil is in the Details
```
Each player is secretly given three pre-written memory cards.These can be anything from fun times at the beach or amusement park, dealing with an abusive parent, maybe something on the horror front and remember being haunted by a ghost. The memories should run the gamut of happy, maybe horrific, but sad as well. Each player should have at least one positive and one negative. 

The players then roleplay going to school with these memories

Players will work through  the story.  Players may attempt to perform any action. The ST then  determines the outcome or may ask for a die roll, setting the difficulty, thus creating a challenge. 

The goal is to explore how memories and emotions drive actions. The ST will challenge the players with atypical school experiences designed to cause the memories to flare up. The concept is to try and understand how emotions are at the heart of our actions and how to persevere with the negative.

# BAWDY ROMANTIC PURSUITS
```
YOU ARE EACH seventeenth century dilettantes. YOU SEEK to woo Lord Byron.

Choose three skills-observation; oration; outdoorsmanship; penmanship; philosophy

Track your ENLIGHTENMENT.  It begins at 88.  When your ENLIGHTENMENT reaches 24, cast off the mind-forged manacles of industrial society and steal Byron's heart.

One player is the George Gordon Master (GGM).  They describe the earth, the mien of its inhabitants, and call for checks when the story demands.

For checks, roll 2d10.  If skilled in the task, put the lowest number first; if unskilled, put the highest first.  The other dice goes second.  If this value is no higher than your ENLIGHTENMENT, the check succeeds.

The GGM calls for a SUBLIME check when you encounter an awesome natural sight or when you roll doubles.  Failing a SUBLIME check lowers your ENLIGHTENMENT score by 1d10.  If the GGM is especially struck by the brilliance of your description, they may invite a SUBLIME check.

BUT WHERE TO GO?  (2d10 and combine)-a peak; a crevasse; a forest; a desert; a cliff; a storm; the sunrise; an hive; a stampede; a waterfall.

WHAT WILL VEX US?  (3d10, in order)-distance; expense; secrecy; peril; rivalry; intoxication; distraction; syphilis; commitments; scandal.

# Morse Code
```
You are a young officer during The Great War. Because of your knowledge of Morse code you have been assigned to the Radio Intelligence Service. Here, it is your job to listen to the enemies radio signals and try to decipher them.

Because of Morse codes ability to transfer at high speeds over telegraph lines, undersea cables and radio circuits it is the ideal way to communicate information to the front lines.

You have just intercepted an important order from the Central Powers (roll 1d6 on the below table), it is now your job to convert this message back into Morse code and send it to your superiors as quickly as possible (set a time limit for yourself, decrease as your knowledge of Morse code grows).

Can you get the message up the ladder in time to help win the war for the Allies?

1. Move troops along the Marne River
2. Allied troops landing in Gallipoli peninsula
3. Ambush British Grand Fleet in the North Sea
4. Attack the French town Verdun
5. Put into place Operation Michael
6. We will over take them in Amiens

# Story of the boat people
```
"Tell a story of our homeland."

You're on a junk ship sailing away from the only place you've ever known. THEY have taken everything from you except your soul. Now you're onboard a dingy boat with no elbow room, headed for someplace better-or so you hope.

Then the food runs out.

You'd heard stories of refugees playing dangerous games on other boats, with unlucky fools becoming sustenance for those left behind. You would not call them winners. But on this boat, the rules are...different.

Stories are the lifeblood of any community. Your homeland as you knew it might be changed forever, but like the name Saigon, it will never be truly gone so long as you remember it.

Tales are told in rounds. After everyone has taken a turn, the worst storyteller is killed to feed the others. Roll a six-sided dice at the end of every round. Remember the result, as you remember home. Once you have rolled six thrice, you will arrive at the mainland with whoever is left. They "win", surviving with new stories to tell.

So tell your story, sailor of dreams. Sing of our homeland. You are of the boat people now.

# BossHate
```


Each player rolls D20 - highest roll is Game Master, second highest is BossHater. Rest are zombie-slaves. Maximum game duration is two hours. 

BossHater: you waste 7+1D6 hours of your life as a (roll D10 - "Profession"). You waste that time in a (roll D10 - "Place of Work"). Your boss is a (roll D8 - "Attribute") caricature of a person. Convert zombie-slaves (see below) to BossHaters and kill your boss.

# Play the Fandom
```
[Up to 6 players]

The players pick a fandom, then each one of them write the following features on a different piece of paper:
-        1 main character
-        2 verbs/actions
-        1 location
-        2 objects
-        1 secondary character
-        2 quotes
-        1 mood/feeling
-        1 story ending
+ choose 3 words (peculiar for the fandom) that all of the players will be able to use only one time each.  
They fold the pieces of paper and mix them up by category, then each player picks 1 or 2 depending on the category (1 location, 2 quotes, etc.). The players follow the alphabetical order and play as the main character they had picked.

The first one starts telling their story using all the picked features and adding everything they wish. The more detailed the better. If the one who's telling the story names any word of those held by any of the other players, they can interrupt the story and start telling their own, taking into account everything that had already been said as facts. The whole story has to make...some sense!
The player who end up telling their whole story wins!

# Transmogrified Creatures Save the Day!
```
Pandemonium!  Our zany scientist, Lord Boogiepants accidently transmogrified the town into weird creatures!  Confused citizens get in your way, it's up to kids of all ages to take turns, cooperate, and fix things!

Everyone draws two cards: first card is your adjective, then your noun!

2-	Stinky / slug
3-	Slimy / squid
4-	Hairy / alien
5-	Wriggly / worm
6-	Funny / squirrel
7-	Jumping / robot
8-	Dancing / ninja
9-	Joking / bear
10-	Singing / zombie
J-	Pouting / pirate
Q-	Hungry / ghost
K-	Spinning / monkey
A-	Laughing / dinosaur

Everyone starts with 8 Moxie.

Take turns, draw two cards, these are others affected by the transmorgrifier field using the above table.  If your Moxie > their highest card, you describe how you use your new form to calm, juke, or trick them, then discard their cards.  

Anyone can loan Moxie to another player each time they:
Ask nicely.
Smile.
Compliment another.
Sing.
Do a dance.

Every player who loans Moxie may help with the description to get past the transgrimogrified obstacle.

If you can't muster the Moxie, shuffle the two cards back into the deck and pass your turn.

Once all cards are discarded, players pull the plug, return everyone to normal, and save the day!

# Wayfarer's End
```
This town's an enigma, wrapped in a portent, baked into a damn fine cherry pie. You'll get to the bottom of it, if it doesn't get to the bottom of you first.

Acquire a vintage cookbook. The more used, the better. Borrow it from grandparents. Buy it secondhand.

Each player writes one Homespun and one Unsettling detail about the town. Discuss.

Each player creates a character or two (e.g. Wonderstruck Outsider, Suspicious Mayoress, Lovesick Librarian, Choleric Preacher, Beleaguered Handyman) and writes down a Homespun and an Unsettling detail about each.

Take turns setting scenes. When you set a scene, write a mystery you'll investigate. Then flip through the cookbook. If you dislike the recipe, start an Unsettling scene. If not, a Homespun scene. If anyone disagrees about the recipe, that player must add a detail of the opposite tone. Draw inspiration from the cookbook's words-especially verbs.

When it feels right, set a scene to resolve a mystery. If you like the recipe, resolve the mystery with Grace. If not, resolve it with Violence. (Anyone who disagrees can add a pinch of the other flavor.) The game ends when players agree enough mysteries are resolved. Copy lingering mysteries into cookbook.

# Droid Middle Management
```
It is the future. The world is mostly run by androids. There have still been humans in the workforce, until today. 

Requirements:
Players - any number.
Ongame spot, "Droid Bar" - a bar, coffee shop, or similar space.
Offgame spot, "Shuttle Stop" - nearby place for players to pass through when they exit.

Everyone plays an android middle manager from a large corporation. You are meeting each other for a drink at the Droid Bar after a long hard day of work. You all meet here together about once a month. You each just laid off your last human employees today.

Start individually outside of the Droid Bar area. Each player should decide how their character feels about humans, about laying them off, and about their own personal future at their company. Each player enters separately when they are ready. 

Play to explore how you individually and collectively feel about the liberation or redundancy of humanity, and your own place in the world.

Each player may end their game by saying goodnight to at least one other person, or to the empty room. To debrief, go to the Shuttle Stop, where players can share what they discovered. When you're done, you can leave.
