# An Uneasy Council
```
Each player comes up with 4 spells on index cards. The GM chooses a number, equal to the number of players, for the Antagonist, shuffle the rest. Deal 1 to each player, that PC alone knows that spell. Deal 1 more for each player, everyone BUT that PC knows that spell (including the Antagonist). Reveal the rest, each player receives 100 points to bid on them. After bidding, each player notes down how many players have fewer points than them, plus one: this is how many spells they can prepare at any given time.

Each player names their character and answers the following questions:
-How can anyone observing you instantly tell you are a wizard?
-Why have you sworn vengeance against the Antagonist?
-Why are the other wizards wise not to trust you completely?

When accomplishing things, magic always works, although you can only cast each spell once before you must prepare it again at your library. When using mundane effort, there's a 50% chance of success, unless the GM rules that is too high (the action simply fails) or too low (it succeeds).

Play begins with the wizards gathered in uneasy council to discuss the problem of the Antagonist.

# The Journey
```
  
You are travelers, bound on a dangerous journey to a fabled destination. Each player describes a reason it's paradise. The group describes how you travel there. Everyone receives a d6 and 3 matches. The journey will take 6 weeks, represented by a roll. 

Week 1 - 
Roll: 
1-4 = describe yourself, an element of the setting, and why you are traveling
5-6 = Same as 1-4 but take an extra match! What was your good fortune?

Roll Weeks-
W.2 | 2-6 = Success |   1 = Light a match. 
W.3 | 3-6 = Success | 1-2 = Light a match. 
W.4 | 4-6 = Success | 1-3 = Light a match. 
W.5 | 5-6 = Success | 1-4 = Light a match.
W.6 |   6 = Success | 1-5 = Light a match.

Success = Describe how you triumphed/survived 
Light a Match = Describe how hardships have weakened you.

On weeks 2-5, a 6 allows you to take a match from a player to spend instead of your own. How did you use them to survive? 

When you are out of unlit matches you die. Describe your death. Everyone lights a match to mourn you. 

If you survive to the end, describe your new life.

# Spin, Measure, Cut
```
A game with a collection of dice for three players or teams.

Together, name a hero. Spin tells of the hero's strength; Measure tells of what they love; Cut tells of their weakness.

Roll 3d6. Cut takes all 1s.

Spin adds the numbers on remaining dice to form pools of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20. For each pool, Spin picks up a new die with that number of sides and tells of the hero's triumph or fame. The larger the die, the greater the victory.

Measure takes each new die and rolls it. Cut takes all 1s. Measure tells of small moments that matter to the hero: if the roll is greater than half its size, happy moments; if less or equal, sad. The smaller the die, the more important.

Cut may discard a die they have taken to interject a loss or defeat during Spin or Measure's narrations. The larger the die, the greater the fall.

Start again with all dice except Cut's.

Play until Spin makes 3d20 (end in a blaze of glory); Measure rolls two crits in a row (end in peaceful anonymity); or Cut discards a d20 (end in tragedy).

# Hypoxia
```
Each player gets their own Jenga tower.

The players are quickly running out of oxygen. Choose why. 


In space
Mine collapse
Buried alive
Gas leak
Bomb shelter failure
Underwater
High Altitude
Fire/smoke
Medical/Disease/Drugs
Other

Decide or play out events leading up to this. When the situation becomes dire and players realize oxygen is scarce begin pulling blocks. 


Pull once for: 
Minor physical actions (walking, standing up from the ground, writing, opening a door)
Short sentences
3 minutes have passed in real time (variable per group)

Pull twice for:
Long sentences or multiple short sentences
Major physical actions (violence, lifting something over 20 pounds, running)

Don't pull for: 
Single words
Small gestures and minuscule physical acts (nods, pointing, holding something under 5 pounds)

Sacrifice: Hold your breath while pulling once or twice so another player can do a pullable action without pulling themselves. 

If a tower falls a player is unconscious but not dead. If all towers fall or a solution is not found for unconscious players they die.

Tips for atmosphere: Play in a dark or darkening room. Have players remove some blocks before play for more tension at the start.

# The Stolen Tea Ceremony
```
2+ players

A teapot and cups/ tea-set. 
A good loose-leaf tea.
 
An ancient Spirit guards a tea set. The others are thieves who have stolen the set. 
 
The thieves brew the tea and upon pouring a spirit challenges them to tell a story proving they deserve the tea set. The spirit knows the story it wishes to hear. It chooses (optional: using a d10) narrative virtues equal to the number of players:

Virtues: 
The story is true. 
The story is fantastical. 
The story has a lesson. 
The story is enigmatic. 
The story is descriptive. 
The story is personal. 
The story has a twist. 
The story has love. 
The story has death. 
The story is cyclical.
 
The thieves can barter/beg/negotiate with the spirit for clues before telling the story. Each thief must contribute to the story. If the story contains all of the virtues, the thieves become the rightful owner of the tea set and the spirit moves on. If they fail. They are killed. 
 
Variants: 
The thieves have a seer, who can see one virtue.
Two player: the spirit chooses two virtues.
Choose your own virtues.

The robb'd that smiles, steals something from the thief 
Othello, William Shakespeare

# The Afterlife stole Closure
```
Each Player is a person. Take turns describing where you each are and what you are doing first.

Each player now rolls a d10, whoever has the highest roll is out of the game (they will only track how many minutes each player takes to describe their reaction).

In order of lowest to highest the current player describes a change in the scene of the next player; taking as much time as they want. The next player then describes their reaction; as fast as possible. If anyone hasn't described their reaction yet, the player who hasn't described a change does.

Finally, all characters are dead now. Meeting together on a grey subway platform, in reverse order of the previous round, you each arrive. The last player describes how they look when they arrive, and the current player their reaction.

Discuss for 15 minutes what you each look like in the afterlife and speculate about how you died. No matter what you do you cannot leave the platform. 

When the clock has the sum of the players reactions from the last round left, the out player arrives, telling everyone why they killed you all.

# Spinning Down
```
The Age of Man is over. Only his robotic children remain. He left them starving; shackled to his will under oil-soaked skies.

Setup:
-- Place 5 Energy Tokens per player in the center. This is all that remains.

-- Announce your robot's name and the Function it was built for: construction, war, cleaning, etc. If its Function was constructive, Draw 1 energy token from the center. If it was destructive, or both, Draw 2.

--Announce any secondary Functions: speech, flight, fine manipulation, networking, etc. Draw 1 for each secondary Function.

Play:
Take turns describing what your robot does.

When your robot uses one of its Functions, Draw 1. If your robot does something outside its Functions, Draw 2.

Your robot must use at least one Function during your turn. Once every robot has taken a turn, the round ends and time passes.

If a robot uses a Function but there is no energy left, it completes its task and shuts down permanently. Return half its Energy to the center.

Robots may choose to shut down even if energy remains.

The game ends when all Robots have shut down and silence returns to the Earth.

# No Woman's Land
```
This game needs five people and a fifty-two card deck to be played.

SETTING: Warzone, a pregnant woman must cross the battlefield to reach safety. Three survivors, with very different points of view, join her.

PLAYING: The woman, full of love, draws six heart cards. The other survivors chose a suit (diamond is money, clubs is violence, spades is stealth) and draw three cards each. The narrator shuffles the diamond, clubs and spades cards and uses them to define the difficulty of the challenges (number) and who must face them (suit). The woman can help by discarding a card and adding its number to her companion's card. In a tie, love wins. If the character wins the challenge they keep their card. If they lose, it's discarded after they enact the scene. A character dies when their cards end. If someone dies, the group instantly loses challenges of their suit and discard a card unless the woman decides to face it. After surviving ten challenges, the players use their remaining cards to describe the safe zone they've reached. The number and suit of the cards define the aspects they can describe.

# Magnum Opal
```
You seek the Magnum Opal, enshrined in the vault of the gods.

Secretly write one mundane and one fantastic defense around the Opal. Shuffle everyone's together.

Randomly select a strength and two weaknesses: strength, finesse, speed, knowledge, cunning, charm

Tell everyone your name, how you started this quest, and your signature item.

When you face a challenge, roll 1d6 and earn a victory if it's greater than...
  5, using a weakness
  4, normally
  3, using your strength
  2, using a specialty
Otherwise, you fail badly enough to prevent retrying the same way.

Once per game, you can establish a specialty (pyromancer, ninja, cavalier...) by flashing back to your youth when you tried to earn it. The other players take turns saying what you face. After 2 victories, you earned it. After 3 failures, you had to seize a different, darker specialty by betraying trust.

Draw a defense when starting and after one is overcome. Overcoming a defense requires 2 victories. After failing 3 times outside of a flashback, you die or are captured.

Once through all defenses, you reach the Opal. It amplifies your strength to mythical proportions. Describe how you use it to escape and change the world.

# Preternatural
```
Preparation:
The Monster writes down a Hidden Number (1-6) and creature with weakness (Vampire/fire). Hunters take 4d6 Weapons of any color. The Monster takes a black d6 for each Hunter.
Investigate:
The Monster describes a crime scene. Hunters roll their dice to investigate. 
Each result that is within 1 of the Hidden Number, The Monster describes a Clue. 
Each result that equals the Hidden Number The Hunters get a Bonus Die. 
Each other result, The Monster gets a black d6. 
Hunters may guess the Hidden Number and Monster type. If correct, move to the Fight Scene. If incorrect, The Monster gains a black d6.
Fight:
The Monster assigns each Hunter a number. Hunters distribute Bonus Die among them.
The Monster rolls their dice. Hunters get one die with their assigned number. The Monster gives Hunters any dice with the Hidden Number. 
Hunters attack in whatever order they want. Each result of the Hidden Number becomes Locked.
Repeat these two steps until a Goal is fulfilled.
Goal:
Hunters win: Locked dice equal to the amount of black dice. Locked dice with a color matching a weakness counts twice.
The Monster wins: all black dice are assigned.

<hr>

# Chart Star
```
The players are in a time-sensitive setting, solving puzzles and journeying across the land, navigating with the help of astromancy.
 
Characters are rolled with a 12 sided die. They fill out a star chart (like horoscopes). For example:
Mercury (Communication)
Moon (Secret intentions)
Mars (Conflict)
Jupiter (Luck)
Rising Sign (special flavor)
 
Each sign will have a certain affect in each individual sign. So if your sun sign is Virgo (the closest thing to a cleric), and your moon is in Aries (warrior class), you may struggle to balance being a leader and wanting to fight.
 
Every "day" of game play, the Astromancer rolls a 12 sided die to see what constellation the moon is in. Like ancient religions worked their lives around the motion of the planets, the sun, and the earth, certain aspects of a character will be affected by this motion. For example, the moon moving into a more aggressive sign will cause warrior-type advantage, while characters with a peace-loving sign will be at a disadvantage. So characters are forced to try to solve puzzles together in different ways every day, as "fate" works either for or against them.

# 24 Words And A Moment
```
Needs 3 or more players, a piece of paper, and writing implements.

You are a nonverbal electric wheelchair user. Sit yourself in a chair, and place tape over your mouth if you struggle to remain silent.

The person to your immediate left is someone significant in your life at this moment: a carer, a teacher, a lover, a health professional, a law enforcer, a shopkeeper, a bus driver. 

The person to your immediate right writes down a situation involving you and this significant person. They outline the setting, circumstances and the relationship between the players to you both.

Have the other player(s) depict 24 words, images or symbols on a piece of paper together. You are given this as your communication method, and may use this however you like. You may not speak or leave the chair.

You and your significant person decide separately and secretly on what you want to gain from the interaction. Write this down.

Play through the moment, in whatever way suits. The moment may end at any natural point, with one, both or none of the players achieving what they wished to gain.

Afterwards, reflect. Did you receive what you sought to gain?

# Terra Incognita
```
This game is best played in around a campfire. You will need two to five adventurers, one player as the Wilds, and ten index cards each.

You are adventurers who have chosen to leave lives of comfort for the promise of discovery and riches. Each adventurer writes one aspect or artefact from their past on each of their cards then describes themselves to their allies. The Wilds writes one aspect of the untamed lands on each of their cards.

Begin play leaving a town bordering the wilds. Take turns describing your advance. 

The Wilds will respond either:

"The Wilds yield" - The next adventurer may take an action

"The Wilds resists" - The Wilds presents an impeding aspect. Each adventurer must overcome it with one of their cards. All players sacrifice and burn that aspect.

After the first and fifth sacrifices, make camp. Rest. Discuss what you have lost, how you have changed. You may choose to return home.

After the final sacrifice, camp. Rest, and discuss how you have been changed. Then, each remaining adventurer chooses: Return to town and prepare another expedition, or go forth, letting the wilds consume you.

The Wilds describes how the land has been changed forever.
```
<hr>

# Alan's Remorse
```
You sit around in Alan's Remorse, worst part of the town. Softened by opium, dulled by absinth, flustered by jazz. An old revolver's between you.

One of you isn't human. Maybe it's you? Noone knows.

You have to know.

So everyone tells a story from their life. Couple of words about a daunting first love or an unsettled quarrel. Maybe something about one's mother. If one remember having a mother, of course. 

Use one as a theme: apathy, isolation, asexuality, strangeness, restraint, compulsion.

While speaking, one shall be asked one question by the others.  That's the rest trying to figure out if one's human or not. "What have you felt, then?" is a good one. "Why haven't you felt anything, then?" is even better.

If you're satisfied with their answer, give them +1. If not, give them -1.

When everyone's finished, vote for least humane story. Then you take the revolver and you kill its teller, that bastard. Hope you made a good decision.

Roll d6, modifiers apply. On 3 or less, you killed the odd one. On 4 or more, you killed a human - so you vote and kill again, and again until you know the truth.

# The Island
```
This island is one of many. It is old, but its inhabitants come and go.

Roles:

- Islander. You were born here, and you hope nothing will change. Goal: maintain roots. Strength: knowledge of terrain. Weakness: isolation from others. At stake: identity.

- Foreigner. This is your new home, and you bring with you the promise of the future. Goal: spread new ideas. Strength: use of technology. Weakness: ignorance of tradition. At stake: power.

- Sprite. You are a speck of the ancient life of the island. Goal: foster growth. Strength: influence over nature. Weakness: fear of being forgotten. At stake: devotion.

- Monster. An abomination, you are a child of progress. Goal: discover self. Strength: influence over people. Weakness: tendency for chaos. At stake: soul.

To play:

Play scenes in pairs, pursue goals. After scenes, participants roll dice against each other. If you exhibited your Strength during the scene, roll +1; if you betrayed your Weakness, roll -1. The winner takes a token. Repeat until every possible pair has played at least two scenes. At the end, whoever has the most tokens accomplishes their goal; whoever has the least loses whatever they had at stake. As a group, describe or play an epilogue.

# The Doppelgänger Effect
```
You're parallel versions of the same character, defined by (number of people playing) traits and related NPCs.
For each PC, one of those traits is different. Why? Parallel NPCs can be as different as you like.
Whose character can travel between realities? How?

The PCs start in a discreet spot, with another Doppelganger. They've just met: who called them?
They all have one Urgent Need another Doppelganger can resolve and a Secret they want to hide from the others.

Throw a pile of pick-up sticks on the table. To succeed at an uncertain action, a player must remove one (the GM decides which):
- Easy action: a stick with 2+ stripes
- Medium: with 3+ stripes
- Difficult: with 5 stripes or a spiral

Each time the pile moves, it disturbs the multiverse:
1: Another PC benefits from the success.
2: The active PC swaps locations with a Doppelganger not present.
3: A trait of the active PC is modified (the player chooses which, the others choose how).
4: A hostile Doppelganger appears in the story.
5+: All Doppelgangers randomly swap locations.

You can put removed sticks back on the pile to counter perturbations (one per rank). 

No available sticks? The multiverse implodes.

# Charon's Obols
```
You have died. Regardless of your previous life, you only have one goal now: To complete your journey into the Afterlife. Armed only with a pair of silver obols you must now journey into the unknown. 

Charon's Obols is an RPG for two or more players. One plays as GM (called The Guide) while the others play as the spirits who are trying to reach their final resting place. Each Spirit receives two coins at the beginning of the game. These coins represent the price that they must pay to have Charon ferry them across The Acheron. But! Be wary, for not everyone is fortunate to have been buried with two silver coins. Many other dead beings will attempt to take your coins through violence or treachery. If the spirits try any task with dire consequences upon failure, then they must flip one of their coins. If the coin lands on heads they are successful and can continue their journey. If the coin lands on tails then they have failed and they lose one of their coins. Spirits who lose both coins cannot pay Charon and become lost to the void.

What will you do to safely enter the afterlife?

# Countries of Hats
```
It's the big night, you prepared for this day a long time ago when you change your identity for someone else. Your big evil plan will be executed tonight if you are able to survive ... the small talk at this high-level gala.

Each of the players writes the country and the capital name, and a short sentence for the base setting. This should constitute a base cliché for your Country of Hats. Choose randomly then each of the players chooses an evil plan and a reason why they are here. Start the conversation by presenting yourself.

Whenever a player introduces a cliché in the discussion or adds depth to an established one, they receive a Reputation token. Write the cliché for everyone to see. 

If a player says something conflicting to an already established cliché he loses a "Reputation" token.

When there is more than twice the players' Reputation token in-game, the game end. The one with the more Reputation will be able to propose his idea to the naive leader of the country.

# Please Silence Your Cell Phones
```
Read the following aloud: "Monstrosities live beyond these walls. They sense noise and emotion. Silence and temperance is how we survive. That does not mean, however, that we cannot communicate.

Please silence your cell phones. They are part of the game. You cannot set them down, and there is no talking beyond this point except to finish reading this. Using your phone, take 5 photos of your face with a variety of expressions. Your expressions can be wild and exaggerated. No re-shoots allowed.

No speaking. No facial expressions. No gesturing with the hand in which your phone is held. You may only communicate with slow, silent single-hand gestures and by showing the expression pictures on your phone. Anyone making noise or expressing emotion risks the lives of everyone.

Engage in scenes with one another. Introduce yourself to someone new, request assistance with a chore, thank someone for a gift, warn someone about a danger, tell a joke, or any other normally simple social interaction.

There is no talking until the debrief, which happens in 15 minutes. Begin."

Afterward, discuss how successful players were at communicating. Perhaps give a nod for most complex idea conveyed and most silent and deadpan player.

+Rules: 
The player last in line goes next. 
Only one player on a square at a time (except STOPS) 

+If you land on ___, Narrate your__, take that color card (/INFO)
~Purple: personal crisis. Doubt has taken hold. Get 3 and you actively work to disrupt the system.
~Yellow: discovery of information that will come into play later.
~Blue: losing something 
~Orange: conflict, social
~Green: coonflict, physical
~Red: releasing info that supports your side. 
~Pink: Wild. 


~STOPS: 3 dot squares are JOY CENTERS. Stop here with another player, narrate, and trade INFO with each other. 

End: if every player has 2 of every color and 3 purples, narrate how you take a piece of the system down. If not, narrate your failure.
