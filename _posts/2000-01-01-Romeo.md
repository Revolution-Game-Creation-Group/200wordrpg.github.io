# Mooncalves in a Minefield
```
You're Mooncalves. Mooncalves are ugly, mean, stupid creatures. You're stuck in a Minefield. When your Patience runs out, you'll blow up. Last one standing wins. Annoy everyone else, before they beat you to it!

Fold an A4-sized paper down the middle. Write your Mooncalf's Name on one side, and three Deformities on the other. Put it down so your Name faces your way and your Deformities face the other Mooncalves. Hand every Mooncalf six six-sided dice, representing their Patience. 

The ugliest Mooncalf gets to take the first turn. On your turn, choose one: 

TAUNT MOONCALF: Insult the target Mooncalf by alluding to their Deformities. Roll their Patience. Steal any 6's rolled and add them to your own Patience.

GET CENTERED: Tell the other Mooncalves what you do to calm yourself. Roll your Patience. For every 6 rolled, steal one Patience from a Mooncalf. Every 1 rolled is removed from the game.

HAIL MARY: (ONLY IF PATIENCE IS ONE DIE):
Tell the others what dangerous gambit you make to endanger another Mooncalf. Roll your Patience. 1-2 : You blow up. 3-5 Steal two Patience from any Mooncalf. 6 Steal four Patience from any Mooncalf. 

Play continues counter-clockwise.

# Hunting the Darkness
```
Beasts rise from the Darkness to consume humanity's Light.  Light defends itself by Illuminating human Hunters, granting them a Gift. 

Someone is Guide and sets scenes and controls the Beast.
Others run Hunters and pursue the Beast.

Hunters: 
Write a phrase describing your humanity, and one describing your Gift.

You have 5 Light. If you lose all Light, you go Dark and join the Beast.

Guide:
Write a phrase describing the form of the Beast.
White a phrase describing the Hunger of the Beast - physical, conceptual, or spiritual.

When Hunters act and the Beast opposes them, Hunters roll 2d6 and add 1 if their humanity helps, add 2 if their Gift applies.  Beast rolls 2d6 and add 1 if its form helps and 2 if its Hunger applies.  If Hunters roll higher than the Beast, they succeed and the Beast Loses Darkness. If they fail, they lose Light.  Narrate how.

The Beast has 4 Darkness +1 per Hunter per scene. If reduced to zero, it is Discovered, Cornered, or Defeated.

Set Scenes, ask questions, challenge humanity:
Hunters DISCOVER the Beast and its Hunger as it feeds.
Hunters PURSUE the Beast, it flees.
Hunters CONFRONT the Beast, it fights.

# RETROTASTIC 8-BIT ADVENTURES
```
In the video game universe, only the bravest heroes shall triumph! 

PLAYING 

A deck of playing cards and three coins with heads and tails sides are needed. 
This is a cooperative storytelling game. One player is the DIRECTOR who creates the plot and stage for the story. Other players assume the roles of characters in an 8-bit video game world and take turns acting out their part. 

The KISMET mechanic decides the outcome of story-altering decisions made by characters. 
The player shakes all three coins in their cupped hands then tosses them to the tabletop.  A player can make one KISMET toss each turn. 

* 1 head = failure without consequence. 
* 2 heads = success. 
* 3 heads = heroic success. 
* 3 tails = utter failure with consequence.

Stories are set into stages of about 10 actions per player. At the end of each stage players draw one card and add that number to their SCORE.  Face cards count as 10, Jokers count as 20. For each 20 points added to total score, players get one REPLAY that can be spent to redo any KISMET toss.

At the end of the story, any remaining REPLAYS can be saved for the next story.

# Just Three Minutes
```
One player is a mighty hero, with amazing powers - but they only work for three minutes. Write four down in secret. The hero is also BIG, STRONG, can FLY and shoot LASERS.


The rest play villains menacing the Earth. They each write a part of their MASTER PLAN in secret, with one initial COMPLICATION.


Both sides reveal and read out their choices.


Start a three minute timer. Our hero must describe how they save the Earth in this time, narrating their actions without stopping. Every time they use one of their POWERS, they mark it. Each time they describe how they solve a COMPLICATION, the villains mark it. Once all COMPLICATIONS are solved on a part of the plan, it is discarded. If all parts of the plan are discarded after three minutes, Earth is saved.


The invaders must watch the timer, and also make sure our hero doesn't:


        VACILLATE: Too many hesitations or pauses.

        DEVIATE: Describing pointless actions to stall for time.

        REPEAT: Using a power that has already been marked.


If they think they have caught the hero out, they stop the timer and add a COMPLICATION to one of the parts of the MASTER PLAN before resuming.

# Egregious Extraterrestrial Ethnographers
```
Break out the tweed and silly hats! 

Tenure time is coming, and the associate space anthropologists need to publish or be thrown out of the department in shame.

You are all collaborators on a new ethnography of an alien civilization; the publication that if successful will save your jobs from certain doom.

Write down your departmental position. Where did you go and what did you do for your postdoc?

Observe, analyze, interpolate, extrapolate, adulterate, obfuscate, and fabricate your way through one chapter of your ethnography per player.

Each player takes a turn acting as The Editor by picking the title from the list below, maintaining the peace among the squabbling academics, and closing the chapter/discussion when no further revisions are needed.

The Value of the Trapezoid 
Purple is the New God King
Economies of Passion
The Misinformed Mating Rituals of Adolescents
Domination of the Fifth Sex
The Inner Meaning of Squarts
The New Super Fashion
Liberation through Noise
Iconography of Skin
Imagined Crab Communities
or make your own

One year later, your ethnography has been cited 1D10000 times. Narrate how your work has revolutionized (or not) the field.

May the locals be friendly and the literature always agree.

# Hotel Apocalyptica
```
Welcome to the end of the world. What better place to spend the apocalypse than a fancy ass hotel, that may also be magic. The Facilitator for this adventure chooses one of the Four Horsemen: War, Famine, Pestilence or Death. Then, the rest of the players say what the horseman did to earn their ire, and describe your character.

Together, each of you tell the story of how the world ends. Share the spotlight, with each of you getting a chance to speak.

When you want to do anything, say what your goal is, and how you do it.
You start with 1d6.
If you are using a object from the hotel, +1 to your roll.
If the plan is daring or bold, +1 to your roll.
+1 if the plan takes an advantage of a debility.
-1 for each debility you have.

1-3: You gain a debility and describe how the world gets worse.
4-5: Your Target gains a debility, or you get what you want, at a price
6+: You succeed fully.

The game ends when you either kill the horseman; or if the world ends, whichever happens first.

# Winner of the 200 Word RPG Contest
```
Participant with the lowest Lake Geneva number is The Dinkie. All others play baby balrogs and must select either Rot Grub, Donkey, or Cleric as their class. Balrogs begin with a score of 10. All dice are d12, except weapons which are all d6. Cup rolls only. To ensure the cup rule is enforced The Dinkie rolls all dice. Initiative is determined by Spin the Bottle, which includes the kissing part.

Players under 50 suffer a -1 to their score for each decade. Players disgusted by the game take a -1. Any player who vomits during the game takes -2. If the Dinkie declares a player to be attractive, that player receives a +2 to their score, but suffer a -1 each time their bottle spins to someone other than The Dinkie. Players who display exceptional knowledge of Polearms receive +4 to their score.

Play begins as the Balrogs are hatched in the carcass of a Maggot God. They must eat their way free. If players can improvise a weapon, they may attack others to prevent their escape, reducing the target's score. Balrogs whose score drops below 2 must roll a Kerfuffle.

How to Win: Impress the Dinkie.

# Rolls of Madness
```
The following game is based on true events. Play it at your own risk.
Setting:
	You, and your friends, are part of a team whose goal is to create a brand of Role Playing games and spread it around the world against all odds.
	The road to success is paved with adversities, from lack of interest from the masses to financial difficulties in starting up your project.
Mechanics:
	Before starting the game, roll 3d6. This will represent your mental fortitude. Every time you come across an adversity, roll a d6. 1-3 result in failure and 4-6 result in success. On a failure, roll another d6, add the new value to the failed roll and reduce it from your mental fortitude.
	In this hard times, the only people you can rely on are your teammates. If their mental fortitude is equal or higher than yours, they can attempt to rise your spirits. In this situation, they roll a d6 and the outcome takes over your mental fortitude test, if it succeeds or fails.
	If your mental fortitude reaches 0, you realize that it was all for nothing, the world doesn't deserve it, and you take your own life.

# Nine Holes in Hell: A Damned Mini-golf RPG
```
You and your friends have died, bound for eternal hellfire, but one of you has an opportunity to get out of this predicament. You must defeat your peers in a game of Dante's 'Inferno' style miniature golf.
The game consists of nine holes, one for each circle of hell. For hole one, limbo, each player rolls a d6, the number on the die indicating the number of strokes taken. Each must describe how they get past the first obstacle, the "castle with seven gates. The player with the lowest score wins the hole. 
The winner describes the next hole's obstacle, making it apt for that circle of hell. The losers of each hole must explain something from their character's backstory as to why they are going to hell for the offence that hole represented and how that slight harmed one of the other players. This process is repeated for all nine holes.
The winner of each hole rolls a d6, while loser(s) roll a d4 (ties go to the winner of the previous hole.) The player with the lowest score at the end avoids damnation.
Circles of Hell:
Limbo
Lust
Gluttony
Greed
Anger
Heresy
Violence
Fraud
Betrayal

# Made Up
```
Ingredients: makeup, fancy clothes, mirrors, friends

This is a game about performance, gender, queerness and the messy spot in the middle. It's about a group of friends grappling with a world that's turned against them. It's about dualities, choosing or not choosing, whether the divide is even real in the first place.

You are: a group of people dressed up nice. Why? Decide.
Who are you? Choose one: dreamer, realist, confused, bitter, loyal. 
What do you think about? Choose one or more but not all: masculine/feminine; presentational/genuine; public/private; conformity/nonconformity

Pre-game: put on makeup, your fanciest clothes, whatever makes you feel alive and beautiful

Game: For five minutes: walk around, admire, have fun. 
Then, take all the makeup off, put on your everyday clothes. Talk about how it makes you feel.

# Dungeons and Dodecahedrons - A Rules-Lite RPG
```
**Character Creation**
Characters begin with five Merits (defining traits). Merits should generally be one-to-two words, such as "archer", "strong swimmer", "socialite", "champion sleeper". Players should have at least one for social, combat, and exploration situations. The Game-Planner may want to avoid Merits that are too broad.

**Playing**
The Game-Planner presents goals; Characters achieve goals by interacting with the world.

**Conflict Resolution**
Whenever Characters want to do something, but an obstacle exists, conflict occurs. Conflicts are resolved through Difficulty-Checks.

The Game-Planner sets Difficulty-Checks, but may use this guideline:
Easy		- 5+
Medium		- 7+
Hard		- 9+
Legendary	- 12+

Oppose Difficulty-Checks by rolling a twelve-sided die and adding +1 for each relevant Merit; success occurs if the total matches/exceeds the Difficulty-Check.

Demerits are like inverse-Merits. Each Demerit grants +1 to relevant rolls against their owner. Examples include "broken armor", "publicly shamed", "drugged".
	- If damage occurs, apply a Demerit.
	- Characters may attempt (possible Difficulty-Check) applying/removing Demerits from a target.
	- If creatures/objects have five (or more) Demerits, they're considered unconscious/broken.
		- Characters decide what happens to unconscious creatures after successful conflict-resolution.
	- Demerits go away after conflict-resolution.

**Advancement**
Characters may advance by gaining more Merits, which should be derived from in-game accomplishments.

# Ramble
```
Every player is a friend and you're embarking on a road trip together. To start, name your character and say why you're going on a trip. Then, discuss the tone you're aiming for - whether that's campy, moody, comedy, or something else. 

Each round, every player rolls 1D6 to get a prompt for part of the trip. You decide what happens together - the person on your right must be involved, but anyone can join.

You found: 

1. Cryptid (What do you see? How does it change your worldview?) 
2. A strange community (Are they welcoming? How do you know?) 
3. Something to destroy (Why did it need to be destroyed? How do you get away?) 
4. Something to free (What told you it needed to be freed? How do you free it?) 
5. A party (What's happening? Do you join?) 
6. Dead end (What's it like? How do you return to the road?)

When a roll is repeated, you can re-roll, build on the previous answer, or introduce a new answer. 

The game can go indefinitely, but everyone must take at least two turns.

End of game questions: 

Are you going home or staying elsewhere? 
Why? 
How have you changed?

# Secret Agenda
```
SECRET AGENDA
A 200-word RPG of action and distraction.
by Seth Johnson

THE AGENTS
You are Engima Agents using your secret skills on missions to save the world. Record your codename and three skills numbered 3-5. Each Agent is issued 3d6.

THE ACTION
The Mission begins with one Agent the Nemesis who confronts each Agent with a Challenge in turn. When you face a Challenge, roll your dice; each 6 and each result matching one of your skills is a success, and you must honestly describe how you achieved success without fully divulging the nature of the skills used to succeed. Each 2 is given to the Nemesis. Each 1 is lost. Matching skill successes let you take a die from the Nemesis, describe how that skill defeated the Nemesis, and become the new Nemesis. 

THE DEBRIEFING
If only the Nemesis has dice, you fail the mission. Defeating the Nemesis three times completes the mission. Write your assessment of other Agents' skills, then reveal your own. For each secret skill you successfully determine, you earn one point. For each skill an Agent keeps secret, they earn three points. The Agent with the most points plus dice wins.

# Turning Toothbrush into Tentacles
```
You play as individuals who discovered they have the power to turn the mundane into something wonderful.

Setup:
GM and 3-5 players
Pen and pieces of paper
Containers

Each player writes two mundane items on pieces of paper (e.g. ketchup, toothbrush). Fold and place into a container.

Repeat with two cool/weird things (e.g. fire, tentacles). Place into a separate container.

Each player draw one from each container. Their PC has the ability to turn [mundane] into [cool/weird].

Each player answers the following about their PC:
Name and occupation.
How did you discover your power?
You did something you regret with your power. What was it?

Afterwards, each player describes how their character knows one or more of the other PCs.

Using the regrets that the players provide, GM devise scenario that brings together and engages the PCs. Play to see what happens.

For actions that are challenging or have potentially interesting consequences, roll 2d6.

10-12: Success.
7-9: Success with consequence.
2-6: Failure.

If a PC's power is activated, failure can be turned into a success with disastrous consequence. This can be done after the roll, as long as it's narratively plausible.

# Continuity Error
```
You are now the editor of a superhero comic! In order to write issues of comics you have to have a character, so let's...

"Create A Super"
On a blank index card, write the name of your Super and describe their superpower in one sentence. [When doing this at the start you have 5 minutes total]

Now let's build our comic continuity! To do this we write comic Issues. You write an Issue by rolling 1d4 & using that result to prompt a one sentence summary of the Issue on a blank paper in pen. You have two minutes to write. When you're finished, title and number your Issue, pass the paper to the right, & the writing process starts over.

Roll:
1 - "Create A Super"
2 - Borrow a Super
3 - Free Reign
4 - Roll Again

Roll Again:
1 - Retcon
2 - Remove a Super
3 - Guest Writer
4 - Crossover Crisis! Everyone playing writes 6 Issues in 6 minutes together. These Issues end the continuity. No more Issues can be written on this paper. 

Save your cards! When you use a previously made Super for a new game you may add one sentence to the index card during the start.

# A Final Reading
```
Each character is attending the same funeral.

Split a tarot deck into the Major & minor arcana.

Each player chooses 3 Major Arcana card to determine 
1) their relationship to the deceased 
2) their relationship to the character on their left 
3) their relationship to themselves

Each player draws 10 cards from the minor arcana deck.

On their turn, a player selects one of the cards in their hand and places it in a time slot.

The past is a memory with the deceased. 
The present is a scene from the funeral. 
The future is how the character moves on or stays behind.

Each suit determines one aspect to the scene
Cups - Someone cries/laughs
Wands - Someone leaves/arrives
Swords - Someone hurts/heals
Pentacles - Someone gains/loses

If another player has a card of the same suit or number, the player can say "I was there" and play the card. Then they describe the scene from their perspective. 

When the silence is uncomfortable, the scene is finished. The player on the left begins a new scene.

The game ends when no cards can be played. Each player describes a detail from their character's death or funeral.

Who attends your funeral?
```
<hr>

# An Incomplete Entity
```
A role-playing game of self-discovery for GM and 1 or more players.

Entity: noun, a thing with distinct and independent existence.

Start with a blank sheet of paper, this is your character.

You are an incomplete entity, a thing of undefined values. Values define what you are, and what you are not.

Values are divided into Attributes (general traits) and Skills (specific abilities).

If an attribute is required, roll 3d10, taking the middle result.
If a skill is required, roll 1d10 to determine.
Write all values on your character sheet. 

Values can be defined only when relevant to the situation, and once defined become a part of what you are.
There is no set list or number of attributes or skills.

When failure is possible, roll 1d0 adding an attribute and skill (or just attribute if no skill is relevant).
Outcomes: under 10: Failure, 10 or higher: Success, 20 or higher: Exceptional, 30: perfect

Alternatively, outcomes can be determined by GM based solely on values without rolling.

Through experience you gain values, through values you gain identity, with identity you gain existence.

Continue play until you are a complete entity, a thing of identity and existence.

# Bowls and Burrows
```
Materials: magazines and books, pen knife, container, public place

Description: Players perform randomly drawn characters and circumstances.

Filling the Bowls: 

1. Flip through the magazines and books, cutting resonant words and phrases from them. 
2. Collect slips until the bottom of the container (the "Bowl") is blanketed in creative potential.

Building the Burrows:

3. With the filled Bowl, go to a public place by yourself or with an accomplice. This place should have other potential players there.
4. Once an accomplice is available, begin by each picking a slip from the Bowl. If no accomplice is available, find one among the rabble.
5. The first slip is the Character to be played. Each player introduces themselves in character.
6. Each draws another slip ("the Burrow") which describes their relationship to the other.
7. The player with the most obtuse slip starts by acting out the Burrow. The other can jump in at any time, evoking their own Burrow.
8. Players continue until their interaction starts to feel like a narrative, at which time they must either Bowl (draw another slip) or Burrow (invite another player)
9. The cycle starts anew.
10. Once done, assemble the used slips into a poem.

Players, while hibernated on an ark-ship, reached their destination. The waking process is failing, enhancing their cryo-dreams!

Set a turn counter, signifying time spent dreaming. If it depletes, players are trapped in the dream forever and loose. 

Using a poker deck, cards represent tiredness (black) or awakening (red). Players will progressively gain awareness and eventually realize they are dreaming.

Adjust number of decks and turn counter to change difficulty (2 - 100 recommended)

Narrator creates a dream-scene (+lowers the turn counter by 1):

- New Dream
- Flashback/Flash-forward
- Connected on Different setting

He also determines a challenge:
"The aliens are charging!"

Players then, going in circles, have a choice to draw a card or "stay", affecting the challenge 
(1 min - 6 max cards, shuffle when out of cards)

Black = Narrator adds dream-like oddities and complications:
"The daggers you use turn incandescent....!"

Red = Who drew narrates a boon instead:
".... and I'm wearing mittens!"

Number of Black determines which dice is thrown (Standard set, d4 to d20). 
Success = 3 largest values 

If challenge is lost, reduce turn counter by amount of cards drawn. Otherwise, remove all black cards drawn this challenge.

When they are all gone, players wake up to enjoy their new world.

# Thief of Lives
```
Each player is an anti-hero in a group of villains who have just stolen different artifacts from servants of good to give to your dark overlord. He needs these powerful items to move on with his plan, but you need to test them first, right?

Your artifact helps you steal something else (souls, bodies, memories, time, love) What does it steal?

Who did you steal the artifact from, how were they using it, and why will they miss it? Why does thinking of them when you use the artifact cause you pain?

Write down 7 traits relating to what your artifact steals. Try to relate these to your being a villain. ( for example--choosing memories--one trait would be your reason for loyalty) Use these traits as a guideline when role-playing your character.

Using the artifact changes you according to what it steals. You gain the traits you steal from your victims. When you gain a new trait, erase the oldest one.

Can you still get along in the group? Would you steal from your teammates to help the mission?

Can you complete your quest? If you can, will you? (knowing that your overlord will be similarly affected?)

# The Returning
```
> LOCATE HUMANS
ERR0R

> TIME REMAINING
ERR0$\u0052

You play robots left behind to take care of Earth in humanity's absence. The millennia have left you corrupted - patched together with makeshift repairs and more than a little strange.

The planet is safe now, and the humans will be returning. It is your job to make things ready for them, but how?

Players describe their robots and decide on two strengths and two weaknesses: Are you heavily armoured? Do you make a very loud beep?

Working with the players, the GM decides what the Archmind believes will make the humans feel welcome: A well-defended barricade against the mutated wildlife? A nice cup of tea? What is tea?

Take turns proposing and acting out scenes to work towards your goal. To resolve challenges, roll 2d6. The highest is your outcome: higher is better. The lowest is your complication: lower is worse. When leveraging a strength, add 1 to either die. When hampered by a weakness, subtract 1. Roll dice one at a time. You may reroll after seeing the first die, but it will cost you: one of your strengths becomes a weakness. Its wording doesn't change, just its interpretation.

> GOOD LUCK
