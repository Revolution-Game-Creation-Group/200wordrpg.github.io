# The Wake
```

Players: at least 1 
Judge, also called a Bard: 1 
Total Needed: 2 minimum: 7 maximum

Arrange chairs equal to number of players + 1. Therefore if using 1 player, 2 chairs should be used. The Judge places a notecard with a Quality in each chair. Qualities can be a single word or single phrase such as "kind to pets" or "former alcoholic" but only one Quality can be on any one card. 

Play: a Player tells a story involving that Quality in some way. The Quality cannot be from their own chair/card. 

All players go until every Player has spoken. If a Player's card is not read - such as Player A being able to read the card of Seat B but Seat B has no player to read Player A's card- the Judge seems that Player a Ghost, the Judge reads the Ghost's Quality, and the Ghost retiree from the game without a story. 

The goal is to tell more Stories than the number of Ghosts. If the number of Ghosts exceeds the number of Stories, the Judge turns out the light and all leave the room.

# Vs. the World
```
Create a Character
Take up to 3 Abilities. For every Ability you take, create a Flaw.
Decide on a Quest. Upon its completion, Level Up or Grow Up! Then think up a new Quest!

Play!
This game uses six-sided dice, which you roll when your character tries to do just about anything. You start the game with 2 Whatever Dice. If you have a relevant Flaw, then you only roll 1 Whatever Die. Each relevant Ability adds 1 Ability Die (just another six-sided die) to your pool. Now roll 'em! Your total is the highest number or the sum of multiples.

Challenges: "Easy" = 4, "Tricky" = 8, "Legendary" = 14,

If you win, narrate! If you lose, the GM narrates!

Level Up!
If you win a fight or do or say something cool, then you Level Up, and you gain a new Ability!

Grow Up!
If you own up to a Flaw or do something mature, you Grow Up! Get rid of one of your Flaws OR gain +1 Whatever Die!

Die!
If you lose a fight against someone nasty, then they're probably going to kill you. Sorry! If you die, just make a new character and get back in the game!

# Upstream
```
At least two people must play. At least three is better. More than six may get confusing.

Determine the number of leaps. Six is good, or you can roll with 2d6. Reroll if you want.

Each player makes up a character, with an age, a gender, a relationship, an occupation, or none. Some people are just lonely. You can use the dice to randomize that if you want. Then, all players decide how their characters are related or know each other.

Then, leap as many times as decided above.

For each leap, roll 1d100. That's the number of years you've gone back in time. You must decide if you're the same character. If your character is 37 and you've gone back two years, you probably are. If they're 16 and you've gone back 80 years, you must be someone else, probably an ancestor. But maybe someone was adopted. Maybe someone was forgotten. You must decide how your story led to your previous character. How do does everyone relate now? Do they even know each other? If so, will your previous characters ever find out? Will your stories remain parallel or were you a clan from many generations ago?

# Vague, Furtive, Disguised
```
Battles for control of the world are normal. There are countless secret organisations and societies that send agents to take part in clandestine operations.

Setup:
Minimum 3 players, 1 Secret-Keeper and the rest are Secret Organisations.
Each player needs pencil, paper and six-sided dice.

**Organisations**
Name:
2 Agents:
 - Name: (public)
 - Two One-Word Traits, one positive one negative: (Secret)
Example: Agent Genghis is Athletic but Arrogant

**Secret-Keeper**
Secretly write down 3 numbers as coordinates.
Invent a scenario to hide each coordinate. 
Example: a coordinate is locked in a bank vault, another is inscribed on an auction item.

Organisations send their agents after any coordinate. All agents are sent to coordinates then players take it in turns to describe the agents' actions.
To gain a coordinate the agents must beat 10 with six-sided dice.
Each agent is worth 1 dice.
A player may reveal an agent's positive trait and explain how it applies to the scenario, if the Secret-Keeper approves they gain another dice.
A player may announce an enemy agent's negative trait to use against them after the positive one has been previously announced, if the Secret-Keeper approves they lose 1 dice.
First Organisation to collect all 3 coordinates wins.

# Pantheon: A Game of Gods
```
Four players embody a growing civilization's Pantheon of Gods.

Remove the aces from a deck of cards and distribute. Shuffle the deck, then make a 5x5 grid of cards. This represents the pantheon's domain. Each card is a region; you are worshipped in regions displaying your suit.

Beginning with the Ace of Spades, each deity tells their story: their origins, icons, values, powers, champions, flaws.

At any time you may snap your fingers, effecting the current story by changing a region. To destroy, roll 1d6 and add your number of regions; if this is above the region's value, flip it face-down. If the roll fails, you cannot interrupt the current tale again. To build, play the deck's top card onto any region. Afterwards, weave these changes into the current story. What occurred? Who is responsible?

Presence is Power. Resolve divine conflicts by rolling 1d6, adding your number of controlled regions.

Whenever a story concludes, add a card to the domain's edge.

When the deck runs out, the pantheon crafts their civilization's collapse together. Flip one of your regions whenever you add to this tale. When you are out of face-up regions, tale ends; your deity is Forgotten.

# The Way You Make Me Feel
```
About relationships, sexuality, and perceptions. Inspired by youtu.be/tGRzz0oqgUE. For 3 players.



You're at a Club, eager to have fun and lose yourself in the music. You see two people in Line and have instant reactions. You want to connect but don't want to just outright ask. Try to let them know how they make you feel.


~Take a Tarot deck (Rider-Waite or similar) and remove The Lovers, putting it at the center. This represents what you want: meaningful connection. Shuffle the deck.

~Each player draws three cards: feelings about the left-hand character, themselves, and feelings about the right-hand character. Do not share these during play. 

~Go around once and describe your character. Repeat this describing your first reaction to the others.

~The Club has several locations: Line, Stage, Bar, Dance Floor, Secluded Corner Booth, VIP, Bathrooms, Coat Check, Smoking Area, et cetera... Use them wisely.

~Each player directs five scenes to let the others know how they feel before Close at the night's end. Anyone can enter a scene anytime.

~Decide together what you do after Close: who goes with who? What you choose to do: one-night stand, longer but turbulent relationship, dream romance, never speak again, friendship?

# The Door
```
A meteor falls from the sky, leaving no crater, only a freestanding, entirely normal-looking door. A unique but similar world lies on either side of... The Door.

Separate players evenly-ish between two rooms (worlds) connected by The Door. Close The Door. Each group rolls a d8 to determine their society's rudimentary culture.

1- Benevolent
2- Peaceful
3- Apathetic
4- Cautious
5- Bold
6- Selfish
7- Aggressive
8- Other (players' choice)

Each player looks around their side of The Door and explains how this culture contributed to one aspect of the room (windowless from caution, etc.).

Each player rolls the die. This tells them the environment their character was raised in. They give a name, a brief description, and a reason why they have come to The Door (peaceful scientist, bold local politician, etc.).

After all players in a world have done this, all players discuss in-character what to do with The Door. They may enter, talk through, look through, etc. with The Door.

After going through The Door, ask about why things are different. Point to something rare in the other world and ask why it's in this one. That world's inhabitants should give an answer.

# Unnamed murder mystery game
```
Mystery Murder Game is the unofficial title of my Board Game Idea. It is a role-playing game of social deduction to find out who the murderer is and to stop them before they escape!

Each player begins the game with 2-3 cards, 1 card is a character profile card showing a character whom has a simple ability. 2 cards will either be an item or a bonus card. There is a chance this card could be telling the player they are the murderer. 

The murderer must make his way around the house with a "target" and kill them. The players will interact with each other each with a side quest to collect certain "evidence" which can uncover the murderer. If they collect all of the evidence it will uncover who the murderer is triggering phase 2 of the game "the chase". 

The murderer will not attempt to escape in a predetermined location on his murder card after removing the target player from the game. Once he has removed that player from the game, the other players will be alerted to his presence. 

Players can collect bonuses which affect room movement (secret tunnel) and random events can trigger with cards.

# The Forest
```
GOAL: Enhance teamwork, decision making, creativity, and storytelling in the youngsters

In this RPG 2 to 4 Players are Forest Criters, and there is a Forest King (Storyteller) that as to be a kid with less than 12 years old.

RULES: 
1 - The Forest King tells the story and challenge the players by question them what they want to do. Every question has a roll that will determin the success of that task.
2 - The Criters listen to the story and answer the questions, favouring the story.
3 - The Forest King will use the roll of the player to keep the story going.

PLAYERS CHARACTERS: Players may choose an animal, and for each one they must choose a POWER and a NONSENSE... and of course a NAME. 

CHALLENGES: The success of a challenge will be determined by the number of your roll. If the roll is higher than 1, then its a success. If it is a 1, it's a failure and the Forest King has to incorporate the NONSENSE of that character in the story. However, if it's a 6, the player may invoke his POWER and describe the resolution of that task.

# Hush A Bye
```
You are Andrea, a twenty-four-year-old young woman living in your parents' basement in Ohio. You got pregnant from a one-time hook-up and somehow hid the whole pregnancy from your parents. Two days ago you gave birth when no one else was home, put the baby in a plastic grocery bag, and took it out with the trash to the curb for pick-up, where it died alone in the night of asphyxiation.

Dogs do uncanny things sometimes. A neighborhood dog tore open the bag in the pre-dawn, revealing the baby to be found by the trash men and reported to the police. You were taken into custody today during your shift at A&P.

Now I will interrogate you and you will answer my questions. You do not request a lawyer. I will ask why you did it. I will ask who the father is. I will ask who knew you were pregnant, and who knew what you intended to do. I will ask other questions. I will ask if you named the baby.

If I get you to cry first, I win. If you get me to cry first, you win.

# Ikigai : One Tiny Life
```
You all are Iki, a minuscule humanoid creature.
You play a number of moments in Iki's one-day lifespan, in order:
childhood	1
adolescence	2
adulthood	3
maturity	2
decline	1

One player describes one moment of Iki's life, a...
...thing seen / heard / tasted / touched
...person met / creature encountered
...action taken / goal attempted

They then grab a BlackDie if they see this moment as challenging, difficult, painful. Or a WhiteDie if it is beautiful, hearthwarming, joyous.

Another player expands this moment describing how things around Iki look, feel, behave, and then grabbs a b/w die themselves.
Repeat until six dice are grabbed, then roll and sum them up by color.
BlackScore > WhiteScore	= write down one positive or useful Quality of Iki's personality
BlackScore < WhiteScore	= write down one Treasured memory from Iki's experience
BlackScore = WhiteScore	the color with less dice wins

Play a new moment.
If possible, spend an unspent Quality / Treasure to inspire it.
Continue until all of Iki's nine life moments have played out.

Look back at it all and discuss: 
how did Iki die?
what influence did Iki have on other's lives?
which mark did Iki leave in the world?
did Iki's life have worth and meaning?

# Post Mortem
```
Once you loved someone. Now, they are lost, wandering, maybe, but not gone. 

Decide who will play the HUMAN and who will play the GHOST. The HUMAN speaks candidly, out loud, about their life and their love for the GHOST. The GHOST may respond with no more than ten words at a time, typed or written out.

Questions for the HUMAN:
Why did you love the GHOST?
What couldn't you tell them while they were alive?
How has the world around you changed since they died?

Questions for the GHOST:
Why do you love the HUMAN?
What have they forgotten about you?
How has their world stayed the same since you died?

You do not need to always answer a question, but they should guide your play.
When the HUMAN has answered all three questions, they move on. Tell the GHOST how.
When the GHOST has answered all three questions, they move on. Tell the HUMAN nothing.

# Multi-headed Monster
```
The Game Master has a lot of power to make this game fun.

Every player except the Game Master plays for one head of a sizable monster - you can be a chimaera, a multi-headed dragon or something else. This brings three main conflicts - the obvious one with people not wanting you around, one of "How do I feed my huge body?" and the third of how your heads go along.

It's better to cooperatively draw yourself first to get on the same page.

If you're healthy and not starving, every head gets 3d6 for a scene, representing energy. Wounded heads get less (unconscious or dead zero) and while starving, every head gets less. You can use them to move your body around and actually do stuff, be it combat, searching for food or just trying to go somewhere. To do it, you roll any number of those dice. The Game Master sets target sum numbers for actual situations, giving bonuses freely for actions that make sense and directly subtracting rolls if multiple heads try to do a mutually incompatible actions.

Keep in mind that heads might have different personalities.

Try different settings (multi-core supercomputer?).

# The Queen's Word
```
Two Queens, once friends, navigate a war in which they are opposed, started by their respective Kings. The war is almost a game of Chess, and requires a Chessboard and four players, taking four roles to match:

The Black Queen _______________, who newly and reluctantly opposes The White Queen _______________, sitting opposite her. At one side of the queens sits Conflict. Opposite conflict sits Fate. 

To Begin, Conflict explains the road to war. 

The Black Queen moves first, otherwise using chess rules. White Queen responds. When both Queens have moved, a year passes. Count the years. Conflict and fate act once a year at will. All roles may speak to each other.

In a Year, the Queens move one piece from their side. The Conflict may move one piece to bloodshed if it hasn't moved that year. Fate may unmake one move a year. The roles narrate their every move and name every newly moved piece.

At the End...

If a Queen dies or 33 years pass, the war never ends. 

If Checkmate occurs, the war ends.

If the queens meet in adjacent squares, a truce begins.

If a pawn traverses to the opposite end of the board, the war ends peacefully.

# The Rumors are False! Everything is Fine!
```
3+ players, 1 "Blame" coin, many "Credibility" tokens

You are the officers/management/cabinet of a ship/corporation/presidency, or other fractious, failing, doomed institution.

Each player describes their "department" in the institution and takes 5 Credibility.

To begin, a random player describes a problem and why it's the responsibility of the department to their left, who has two options:

* Pass the problem, describing why it's actually the responsibility of the department to _their_ left (who then accepts or passes it themselves) and lose one Credibility.

* Accept the problem, describing how they can solve it, then take and toss the Blame. 
Heads: problem solved cleanly. 
Tails: problem solved, but they lose one Credibility. 
The Blame remains with them until someone else takes it.

If a problem gets back to the player who first declared it, they loose one Credibility to fix it and take the Blame without tossing it. 

To continue, the player to the right of the last problem-declarer presents a new problem to their left, and so on. Game ends when a department runs out of Credibility. Whichever department has the Blame at the end is derided by the rest as the cause of it all.

# Start Making Sense
```
You wake up as one of the senses.

Sight, taste, smell, hearing, touch of a human.

It seems that this body has no mind rather you, the senses, are what thinks for them. Your actions are their actions.

How did you become these?
Maybe there is a way back to your own body if you can make it through the day.
How long have each of you been here?
Communicate with each other to make the person function.

Each part is responsible for their own function.
Sight - Eyes - Looking
Taste - Mouth - Speech
Smell - Nose - Emotion
Hear - Ears - Noise
Touch - Muscles - Movement 

Only one sense can have control over the nervous system at a time and communicate their findings to the body. When finished, pass the nerves over to another sense of your choosing.
Once a day each sense can have an 'overload' in which they take control of the nerves, stating an epiphany that's true about the world or situation. 

Who were you?

# That's Not How It Went Down
```
One person plays as some form of interrogator (detective, school principal, CIA agent, etc.) and the remaining players act as the interrogees (suspect, student, etc.).  Before the start, the players mutually upon the scenario of the interrogation.  The interrogator will start the interrogation and will ask questions that go through the who, what, where, when, how, and why of the alleged crime.  

The interrogator and the interrogees will each have a 1d6 (A single 1d6 is shared among the interrogees).  Each number on the die represents a form of evidence that can be presented that will give momentum of the interrogation to that person.  The higher the number, the stronger the evidence. If presented, the opposing player can either allow the momentum to swing or present their own evidence that refutes the evidence if it is a higher number. A player can also use the same number to refute the evidence, and momentum will be decided on a head-to-head roll. If a player uses a piece of evidence, they can no longer use that number on the die for evidence or on a head-to-head roll.
