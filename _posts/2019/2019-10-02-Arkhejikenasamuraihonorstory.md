1703 AD, a group of ronin (masterless samurai) seek to avenge their Daymaio by assassinating the Suke (imperial official) that caused the disgrace of their clan.
Tonight, defying Shogun orders, they assault the Suke's fortified residence.
Narrate flashbacks of byzantine preparations.

The residence (depicted below) has 4 posts with #PCs guards each.
Stone walls (= & ||) force a spiralized path to the house.

PCs and NPCs have 10 HP and can perform two actions per round:
- move up to 2 steps;
- attack an adjacent foe, dealing d10 damage.

A PC can take a Dishonor Point (DP) to choose the result of a dice rolled by or against him.
A PC choosing to betray the party, discards all his DPs and prevents everybody from taking any more while alive.
The "traitor" can consume a DP from a loyal "samurai" to reroll a dice rolled by or against him.

If the "samurais" are defeated, the "traitor" gains a position under the Suke's command.
If the guards (and "traitor") are defeated, the Suke is captured and vengance fulfilled.

The Shogun, recognizing their loyalty, may grant the "samurais" the honour of sepuku (ritual suicide), finally cleaning their family name.

I sincerely doubt you can do this any better, it's a wonderful challenge :D. I'll wait to see how the you manage to put together the new feedback from the readers. I believe that this is the single most relevant aspect for a designer (just having someone actually reading the entry and making a comment on it make the effort worth it).
