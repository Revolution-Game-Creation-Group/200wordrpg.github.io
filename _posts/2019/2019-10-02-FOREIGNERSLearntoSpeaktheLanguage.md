Poor communication generates funny/absurd/terrible results. Adapt to the country while improving your language and other skills. Advance by reaching milestones (GM's discretion).

Skills
Language
Mental
Physical
Social

Assets
Acquaintances: not influential/powerful, but somehow useful (4 + ranks in Social).
Camping-gear: tent/knife/camping-stove/sleeping-bag/weather-outfit.
Car: second-hand, working-condition.
Computer/Phone: Internet-access.
Gun: second-hand pistol.
House: shared-kitchen, own-room; otherwise, sleep in cramped-place or the street.
Job: moderate-income, six-hours/day; otherwise you have just the minimum for survival.
Papers: you're legal!

System
-Character creation: Add two ranks to either Mental, Physical, or Social. Choose one asset. Choose one profession/trade (open).

-Milestone: Add one rank to any skill. Every third-milestone, get an asset.

-Assets may be got in-game too (GM's discretion).

-Important matters: Roll eight-sided die plus skill-ranks:
1: Failure. Always when rolled; actual outcome modified by skill-ranks.
2-7: GM's discretion, depending on task.
8: Success.

Attacks use either Physical, or best skill -2. Success inflicts wounds:
Bare-hands/non-metallic-items/light-items: one-wound/hit
Knives/heavy metallic-items: two-wounds/hit
Guns/big-blades/bows: three-wounds/hit
 
Wounds
Wounds = maximum ranks in highest skill: Character can't move or use skills.
Wounds = maximum ranks in highest skill + 2: Character is dead.

Healing: one-wound/week.

Er... 50 more words? Just kidding: the painstaking task of shaving those 50 words was the part I enjoyed the most. Honestly, I just came to know of this challenge one week ago, so I'm still getting acquainted with it. Next year I may have a suggestion for improvement.
