POSTGENDERIST REVOLUTIONARIES have killed GENDER.  Even now, scientists (4+ players) forge the HomeBody, a compulsory, "less-wrong" replacement for human biology.  However, Gender's ghost (1 player) haunts their progress.  Boo!

[Setup]:

Place a toy gun and some Play-Doh on a table.  Discuss safety (touching, physicality).  Bring Skypeable phones, new Skype accounts.  Share Skype names. 

Scientists:  Enable Skype's "answer incoming calls automatically" option.  Connect earbuds to your phones.  Wear them.  Conceal phones on your person.   Choose 3 HomeBody requirements: maneuverable, militarized, spacefaring, aesthetic ("Brutalist," "Minimalist," ... ), emotive, reproductive. 

Gender:  Leave playspace.

[When everyone's ready]:

SCIENTISTS:  Attempt to sculpt a gender-free HomeBody prototype using Play-Doh.  Design.  Discuss.  Argue.  

GENDER:  Possess individual Scientists by Skyping them.  Speak.  Direct their speech/actions.  Force gender into the design process/sculpture.  Each possession must last at least 2 minutes.

POSSESSED:  Obey Gender only while you hear it.  Never:
>>>Discuss your possession.  
>>>Destroy the sculpture.

SCIENTISTS:  If everyone (besides the accused) points to the same suspected Possessed and improvises an anecdote about their dubious Revolutionary history, load the gun (holds one bullet, begins empty).  Point the gun at someone, shout "BANG!"--they're executed.  Executed Scientists leave.  

EXECUTED POSSESSED:  Become Gender.  Previous Genders: whisper advice. 

End when rigidity sets in.
