You are TRAVELERS, on a perilous journey to the PROMISED LANDS.

Divide nine points among the following stats: ATHLETICS, LORE, THIEVING, PERCEPTION, CONVERSE, MAGIC KEN, SURVIVAL, and SHOTGUN.

Name and describe your traveler. Each traveler starts with a sword and clothing.

Your traveler has eight COIN. One COIN buys:
* Bandages
* SHOTGUN points
* Tools (bonus points in a stat- describe)

The NARRATOR rolls 1d6 to determine an encounter.
1: Environmental hazard
2-3: Monster encounter
4-5: Hostile humans
6: Human civilization (Trade?)

To perform a task that has any risk, roll a d6 per point in a stat. Use the highest die:
6: You succeed!
4-5: You succeed, but at cost.
1-3: Bad stuff happens.

(0 points in a stat? Hail Mary! Roll a d6 and hope you get a 6, otherwise Bad Stuff happens!)

Instead of using a stat, you may spend SHOTGUN points and roll those to shoot a problem in the face. Spent SHOTGUN points are lost forever.

Some "bad stuff" may include losing gear, temporary stat penalties, or injuries. Four injuries and your traveler dies. SURVIVAL or bandages can remove injuries.

After ten journey legs, surviving travelers reach the PROMISED LANDS. Describe them!
