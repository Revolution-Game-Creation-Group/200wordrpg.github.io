# Aces over the Adriatic
```
You are a seaplane pilot in the Adriatic. The year is 1922 and the taverna you frequent is rapt as you tell tall tales of derring-do; fighting sky pirates, finding treasure etc.

For each pilot add six, six-sided dice to the Audience pool.

One Pilot starts telling their tale of heroism. Tally the acts of heroism you describe, roll one Audience dice for each.

1's leave, unimpressed by your bluster, remove the dice from the game.
6's, impressed by your tale, buy you a drink. You keep the dice.
 
Next the other pilots may each ask one question. If you cannot answer, or if all the other pilots agree you didn't answer properly, give the questioning pilot one of your drinks, if you have one.

The pilot to your left takes the story and explains how they are the real hero, continuing the tale, or may pass.

Once there are no dice left in the audience or all Pilots pass in a round, the night ends. The following morning roll and add all of your drinks. Whoever gets closest to 17 without going over had the most merry evening.

Everyone shakes hands. 

We must do this again sometime.

# You're Wasting Time
```
The only thing you will use in this game is Time, just your Time.

Step 1: Choose your Time limit of the play, 
when the Time ends the game is over!

Step 2: Choose a setting and a group goal.

Step 3: Create the characters, each with 3 distinctive traits, 
each trait must bring out a capacity 
(strength, dexterity, inteligence etc ..)

Rules of the game: Each character can do any type of action, 
but has a time limit to describe what he does, 
if the description is incomplete or inaccurate the Master decides what happens. 
Instead, if he is precise and accurate, he succeeds in its intent automatically. 
The Master can choose the following difficulty tests, 
and the player only has that time to describe what he does.

Easy: 10 seconds
Normal: 5 seconds
Hard: 3 seconds
Extreme: 1 second

if you have to do a test linked in some way to one or more of your traits, 
you gain 1 second for each trait related to that test.

if the time ends before reaching the goal you have lost

play this game to spend good time with your friends.

# Bangsian Hell, Clipped Syntax, and Ecphonemes
```
3+ players, more the merrier!

Decide randomly first person to pick a famous dead person to be their character. Continue clockwise until everyone's picked different dead people to play.

Last to pick describes the afterlife. Are y'all in Hell? Heaven? Houseboat on the Styx? What drinks are served? Set the tone! Answer questions from others.

Player whose character's been dead longest frames scene in that afterlife, all characters present. 

Interact and talk! Argue! Flirt! Plot! Whatever seems natural, but chew scenery!

Focus is dialogue, but if something like battle happens, flip a coin. Before flipping, everyone must agree what happens on heads and what happens on tails.

Additional characters can be introduced and played by anyone, but also vetoed by anyone. 

Resolve out of character impasses with coin flips.

Don't feel obligated, but once apiece, each player may call for a twist. If you do, roll a die and consult table below. Player to your left decides how to implement.

1-Someone is an impostor!
2-The afterlife status quo has been upset!
3-Romance blossoms!
4-An unfortunate truth is revealed...
5-One of you feels sick. WTF?!
6-Friends become enemies...

Game ends when scene does! Play again?

# Occupational Safety and Health Adventures
```
You are a team of co-workers. Decide together:
- What is your workplace?
- What big project is the boss breathing down your neck about?
- How is your workplace catastrophically unsafe?

Individually, name your character and decide:
- What is my role on the team? (coordinator, expert, grunt, caretaker, gofer)
- Why do I keep messing up? (lazy, greedy, incompetent, dishonest, arrogant)

Take turns framing scenes starring your character. Everyone else plays their parts and NPCs, as needed. Each scene should lead to a point where one character (not necessarily yours) must risk their safety to move forward with the project. That character's player chooses:
1. Accept the injury. Don't tell the boss.
2. Report the unsafe condition. Tell the other players what new safety rule the boss has imposed. The other players decide how the workspace will be altered to comply with this rule, in a way that makes the workplace less safe and less efficient overall.

The game ends when either:
1. The project is completed. The team is congratulated by the boss for a job well done, and for their good safety record.
2. One character accumulates three injuries. The team is reprimanded and the project is given to another team.

# Little Katy's Tea Party
```
Make tea. Sit around a table with an extra chair. 
This was Katy's chair, but it's no more.
You'll play scenes of the past to find out why.

You're Katy's Friend - a kid, puppet, or pet. 
Describe yourself through Katy's eyes.

PLAY SCENES
Take turns at framing scenes regarding Katy's discomfortable events.
Take a sip of tea to play the scene in character, otherwise play it out-of-character.

PLAY IN CHARACTER
You did your best to help Katy. 
Your acts against Katy's discomfort were successful, provided another player agrees by taking a sip of tea. 
Another player can suggest a different outcome instead:
- you can take a sip of tea and agree;
- or you can reveal something discomforting about you in Katy's eyes: this made you successful and cuts the scene. The third time you do this, you'll become a Monster to her.
Monsters cannot succeed against discomfort unless all other players takes a sip of tea.

PLAY OUT-OF-CHARACTER
Play Katy's reactions.
Describe the source of Discomfort: that's all that isn't a character.

ENDGAME
When most players have finished their tea: 
- each Friend says something that Katy still remembers.
- each Monster says something that eventually drove her away.

# And They'll Hear You When It's Done
```
You're an obscure band on a very important cross-country tour. This is your shot. Unfortunately, you're all quite thoroughly cursed. 

Each player invents a backstory and selects 2 curses:

Pain - Everything hurts.
Fear - Everything is terrifying. 
Gab - Must keep talking. 
Honesty - Can't lie. 
Speed - Must keep moving.

Curse counters start at 2. 

When a musician does something important or stressful, roll 1d6. If the roll is equal to or under their highest curse counter, they stumble: increment either curse by 1 point. 

If a curse is at 3 or higher, it flares whenever the musician stumbles. When it reaches 6, it remains in effect until dropped to 3.

To drop a curse counter, a musician can cope or remember. Frame a scene and roll. If they don't stumble, subtract 1 from either curse. Alternatively, they can seek comfort: another musician rolls instead. 

Each player defines the nature and location of at least 1 gig on the tour. Hold a band meeting after a gig is defined. The last, most important gig is defined collaboratively (everyone adds at least 1 detail). Every gig presents each musician with a major task or challenge. Take turns framing scenes until the tour ends.

# Dreamsongs Behind Closed Eyes
```

The real and dreamed fold over and over; daylight memory songs and the night's recital.  Dreamsongs behind closed eyes.

RULES:
Everyone is a player.  
Players direct a child's dream as a team.  
The youngest player starts the dream.

All players have 1d6 DREAMDICE.
Roll DREAMDICE and keep the result.  These are counters.

TURN SUMMARY:
Describe the child's observations and actions.
Decrease any player's DREAMDICE counter by 1.
DREAMDICE are removed at 0.
Repeat moving clockwise to the next player.

The child wakes when all DREAMDICE are removed.  

GOAL:
Tell a dream or nightmare story together.

INTRODUCTION:
The mind of a child is white linen-it flows with every breath of inspiration, every touch of imagination. 
Imagine blue sky hues blending into green hills.  You are here shaping this closed-eye world with your breath and touch. 

You are not alone.

Fluffy-stuffed attic bear clouds roll in, soft and cool like under a summer pillow.  
You bend them, shape them into familiar friends.  

There is a house here.  Ants and small things burrow in a croaking darkwood porch. 
A screen door clacks against an eyed and gnarled frame.  

The hungry, clacking, screen door mouth invites you in.  What is inside?

# Parliament
```
Players are members of Parliament, a society of simulated consciousnesses which democratically decide the actions of a robot living in the real world.

Required: One Chancellor and three to five Party Leaders.  Leaders each create parties with three policies.  Each Leader has a private world which they control and which can be anything they imagine. There is also a public space controlled by the Chancellor which can be anything they imagine.  Finally, the robot operated by the Parliament lives in the real world, which should be futuristic but operate according to accepted laws of physics.

Each session, the Chancellor describes a situation faced by the robot. Each Leader makes a speech regarding their party's platform on it.

Each Leader may invite another to their private world. In turn, meet in another room.  Describe what happens in your world.  Invite the other Leader to make a deal to support your platform.

Finally, one Leader proposes a resolution as to the action of the robot.  Leaders will hold a vote on each proposal.  If one passes, that is what the robot does.  If it fails, another Leader proposes another resolution.  If all resolutions fail, the Chancellor decides the consequences of inaction.

# Gentlemen Thieves
```
You are a dashing and noble thief.

Describe yourself. Embellish everything.

Use a deck of playing cards, remove the faces and aces. Cards are rooms.

Place the Ace of Diamonds. That room has The Prize. 

Place face-down cards in rows of 3 beneath the Ace.  5 rows is a good size.

Start below the last row, any column. Whoever politely refuses to go first the most, goes first.

You get one move per turn, orthogonally. 

When you move into a room, turn it face-up. Describe the danger. To move out of a room, roll 2d6 higher than the number. Rolling under is a suave failure. Regardless, gesture politely to a thief who hasn't gone this round. They go next.

You all are honorable thieves. Everyone in a room rolls when anyone rolls. Narrate how you graciously assist. If anyone succeeds, each may leave at their next opportunity.

Take The Prize by entering a room with it, or by starting your turn in a room with it. If you have The Prize and fail a roll, you still move, but drop The Prize behind. Damn.

Leave where you entered with The Prize to win. Be ruthlessly polite and politely ruthless.

# Jordan, A Lifetime in 1 Hour
```
Gather up to three other friends. You will narrate the life of Jordan.

Take a deck of cards and separate out one suit into the piles below the instructions.

Shuffle each pile face-down separately.

Each player takes turns drawing cards from the piles until they are depleted.

Narrate short but meaningful scenes for the associated card age as flashbacks, memories, or real time scenes involving the other players.

ANY cards drawn from the same pile AFTER a face card affect your life negatively.

When the Ace is drawn, your life comes to an end.

Pile 1 - Adolescence through Teens
2 - Age 5
3 - Age 10
4 - Age 16
J - Tragic Family Death

Pile 2 - Young Adult through Middle Age
5 - Age 18
6 - Age 21
7 - Age 30
Q - Attain Life Goal (if before a K, if after a K then disregard this card when drawn)
K - Major Life Setback (if before a Q, if after a Q then disregard this card when drawn)

Pile 3 - Old Age
8 - Age 50
9 - Age 70
10 - Age 90
A - Death, Talk as a group and come to an agreement on the best suitable death befitting your character's life and legacy.

# Lost Letters
```
   You are adventurers in a stock standard dungeon crawl. You must defeat monsters in the rooms between you and the treasure. To do so, you just say how you attack and defeat those monsters. There's a catch, however, at any given time, there is one (1) letter you can't use. Each player plays whatever adventuring class they would like, and has four hit points. A player is hit when they use a word containing a banned letter, stop talking, or repeat an action. They then roll a d4 and swap their letter for one in the next higher group and the GM narrates how their action fails.

  Uninjured: M, C, F, P
  Three: H, L, D, U
  Two: N, I, S, R
  Last hit point: E, T, A, O

   The GM should present a room containing monster(s) that have total HP from equal, to double, the number of players. A dungeon contains 5 rooms. Players take turns in a clockwise manner.
   This game is based off an activity to help neurotypical people understand what it's like to struggle to communicate. The standard dungeon crawler format is used so that players don't have to think too much about the setting.

# Puppy Posse
```
Who do you call when...
* A shipment of sharks spills into a pond in the park?
* Mayor Gooseberry's prized goose gets stuck in a tree and can't get down?
* Captain Tipper's ship gets lost in the fog?
You call the Puppy Posse!

Lead by Sarj, the Puppy Posse are an elite team of pups who help protect the citizens of Bay City. Each pup drives a cool car and has a bag of awesome tricks to help them save the day whenever there's trouble.

Puppy Posse doesn't care about things like taking damage, tracking equipment, adding bonuses, etc. It's a storytelling game designed to help children ages 4+ learn to tell stories using dice. 

HOW TO PLAY
Each player names their pup and picks a cool car. Sarj, the Game Master, comes up with a problem to solve. He asks each pup in turn to roll dice and tell part of the story. Play continues until the mission is complete.

# Existential Crisis
```
Goal: Using prompts from another player and playing cards, live another life.

Setup: Each player takes one color of a deck of cards and shuffles the numbered cards. Deal two cards face-up and one face-down then shuffle their aces and face cards into their half-deck and place the face-down card on top. The face-up cards provide the starting point for your life's story. The value of each card represents how well-off your parents were. If the cards are of the same suit, then your parents are still together at the start of your story. The sum of the two cards is your starting age.

Play: Each turn, players select a category (Family, Health, Love, Money, Law, Faith) for their partner then draw a card. Each player then relates what occurred to their character over the revealed period of time. This continues until both characters' lives are ended.

Cards: Numbers - How many years have passed 
Faces - An addition/detraction to the previous event
Aces - First ace is an existential crisis - something that causes a drastic change in your life's direction. Second ace is when your character dies.
Suits - Your character gains (hearts/clubs) or loses (diamonds/spades) during this life event.

# Abjection!
```
I'm the Judge.
To my right stands the Prosecutor, whose goal is to convict a suspect.
To the left is the Lawyer defending them.


Prosecutor, you begin by writing two Facts - short, factual sentences like
[The victim was killed by a spear].
Then you both draw 5 cards from a shuffled 52-card deck.

At each turn :
-  Draw a card.
-  Play one (or more) face-down card, take a deep breath and
   yell...
   ____  _     _           _   _               _ 
  / __ \| |   (_)         | | (_)             | |
 | |  | | |__  _  ___  ___| |_ _  ___  _ __   | |
 | |  | | '_ \| |/ _ \/ __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \  | |
 | |__| | |_) | |  __/ (__| |_| | (_) | | | | |_|
  \____/|_.__/| |\___|\___|\__|_|\___/|_| |_| (_)
             _/ |                                
            |__/                                

If you played : 


     > One JQKA-card : Add a new Fact.
       I'll check if it doesn't contradict the others Facts.
       [The suspect was seen holding a spear]
 
     > One (or more) Heart-card : For each card, add, delete or change exactly one letter in a Fact.
       I'll decide if the updated Fact is meaningful.
       [The suspect was seen holding a *pear]

If you think your shady opponent is bluffing, you can reveal their face-down cards by shouting... 

           _     _           _   _               _ 
     /\   | |   (_)         | | (_)             | |
    /  \  | |__  _  ___  ___| |_ _  ___  _ __   | |
   / /\ \ | '_ \| |/ _ \/ __| __| |/ _ \| '_ \  | |
  / ____ \| |_) | |  __/ (__| |_| | (_) | | | | |_|
 /_/    \_\_.__/| |\___|\___|\__|_|\___/|_| |_| (_)
               _/ |                                
              |__/                                


If they're indeed cheating, the effect is canceled and you draw a card. Otherwise, they draw two.

I'll deliver my verdict after the Lawyer's tenth turn :
-  The suspect is guilty if linked to a [Murder Weapon], has 
   a [Mobile] and no [Alibi].
-  Otherwise, they're free.


           _ _     _____  _            _ 
     /\   | | |   |  __ \(_)          | |

# Snooze Button
```
Your alarm goes off, loud, intrusive. You hit the snooze button. Work awaits you, but here in bed, you are safe, warm, secure. Something else draws you to stay just a little longer. A partner sleeping peacefully beside you, an affectionate pet curled up against you, a dream threatening to vanish into the early morning haze. You drowsily realize you have another thirty minutes before you absolutely have to get up.

Draw a card from a shuffled deck to determine how long you can doze before the alarm returns. Numbered cards are that many minutes, face cards are ten, aces are eleven. 

Describe how your morning continues. Your partner mumbles in their sleep. Your pet snuggles against you. Your dream takes an intriguing turn. Decide whether to rise and great the day or hit snooze again and savor this a little longer.

Repeat as many times as you choose.

If you pass thirty minutes, you can hit snooze again, but you also must describe what you are giving up in exchange. Cutting your shower short, skipping breakfast, having to sprint to the bus instead of walk.

Beyond sixty minutes, you are late for work. Describe how this affects your day.

# Spectrum
```
You are a group of volatile people confined in close quarters. Maybe you are in prison, a group of high schoolers going through puberty, or astronauts getting cabin fever. Emotions are running high and everyone wants to get out.

You need a bag of M&Ms to play.

At the beginning of the game, decide on a situation with a goal the players are working towards. Then, go around the circle and each player introduces their character. 

At the beginning of each round, a player draws an M&M from the bag and narrates what happens based on the color. Each player then draws their own M&M from the bag and reacts based on the color they drew. Once everyone has finished reacting, the next player in the circle draws another M&M and starts the next round. The game is over when you run out of M&Ms. 

Events:
Red - It all goes horribly wrong
Orange - A sudden reversal
Yellow - Crazy coincidence
Green - A secret is revealed 
Blue - Miraculous success
Brown - Something escapes

Reactions:
Red - Anger
Orange - Disgust
Yellow - Joy
Green -  Fear
Blue - Sadness
Brown - Apathy

# Torture Traps: The Last to Die, Wins
```
Torture Traps: The Last to Die, Wins
By Jon Hook 

This GM-less RPG is a cut-throat survival horror game. 

You and your friends have been captured by an insane serial killer. He explains, "The last one alive is free to go. If more than one person is alive at the end of the game, you all lose!" 

Each player must have four six-sided dice that are uniquely identifiable as belonging only to that player. The player uses the dice to conquer torture traps, and they represent that player's life. If any player is no longer in direct possession of their dice, that player is dead. The players describe the nature of each torture trap, and the results of the dice rolls. 

Torture traps have a rating that must be EXCEEDED to survive it: 
Uncomfortable (5)
Painful (9)
Brutal (13) 
Inhuman (18)

Each player must survive two of each type of torture trap, and be the sole survivor. Failing a torture trap results in the loss of a die. 

Before testing any torture trap, a player may attack another player. Each fighting player rolls all of their dice, the player with the lower total value loses one die.

# What We Don't Know
```
The woods are quiet, and far from the village.

Each player draws from a deck of playing cards (jokers removed). 
-The player who draws lowest is The Outsider. 
-The others are the villagers who have brought The Outsider to the woods to execute for their crimes against their community (real or imagined). The crime is irrelevant. 

This game takes place in a single moment of grim resolve.

Starting with the villager who drew highest and continuing clockwise, draw a card and say "We will kill you because we don't know...", and relate a scene from The Outsider's life that has led them to this moment. Both suit and value of the card informs the scene.

Hearts: Personal relationships
Diamonds: Resources
Clubs: Authority
Spades: Society

Value = number of months passed since the scene happened. Face cards represent scenes since The Outsider came to the village.

During the Outsider's turn, they do the same, but say "You will kill me because I don't know..." and relate a scene that made the villagers hateful. 

Play proceeds until 4 face cards have been drawn, at which point the moment has passed, the sentence carried out. Describe it.

Sit in silence for about a minute.

# Warrant
```


One deck, 52 cards. No jokers. Aces are valued at 14.

You work at a security checkpoint, protecting your big-wig employers from the rabble of the pleeblands. But maybe there's a way out? Think of a card: this is your warrant. Write it down and keep it secret. Get fired with this card in hand, and you win.

Draw a pool of clients (players x2) face up. Everyone draws 3 cards from the draw deck to have in hand.

Each player in turn picks a client to clear by playing cards of the same suit; equal or greater value clears. Other players can contribute anonymously, but the wrong suit counts down!

If you succeed, you can either let them pass into the cleared pile or take them for yourself.

Have more or equal cleared clients than failed at the end of the day, or you're all fired!

Played cards and cleared cards are discarded at the end of the day.

Failed cards and cards in hand are re-shuffled into the draw deck.

Another day starts, until the draw deck is empty or anyone cannot draw a full three cards in the morning. Shuffle deck. Begin again.

Work together. Trust no-one.

# A Day In the Life
```
You are creating a world together. One where people live, go to work, and maybe something out of the ordinary happens. It can be as mundane, or as fantastical, as you desire.

This is a game for 2-5 players. You could push five, however you may find that too hectic.

To begin, go around in a circle. Have each player define something about your world. It can be anything from the style of structures, to the type of food people eat, or the way people interact. Whoever defined that trait now has ownership over that aspect of the world.

Each player also creates a character and loosely defines how they interact with the world.

Begin with the last person to define something about the city and once again go in a circle. They will begin to narrate a typical day for their character. Other players can help out with conversations they have thought the day. When they encounter something that another player owns the aspect of, they can stop you and complicate your day. Then the person who is narrating explains how their character would navigate and overcome the complication.

# Weavers
```
You are a member of a cabal of Weavers. The day you finish your novitiate, your masters are found dead, in the centre of the Fairywood Glade. 

Each one of you masters three Threads. These are words like Shield, Fear, Fire, Steel, or Illusion, for which you have affinities, and you perfectly learned during your apprenticeship. 
Each one of you masters only one Shuttle, discovered in your youth, that made you a Weaver. Roll 1d6 : 
1. create 
2. transform 
3. destroy 
4. perceive 
5. control 
6. choose.
 
You are powerful together : weaving a spell requires a wizard to associate their own Shuttle with another wizard's Thread. You need others as they need you. 
There may be more Threads (from the same or other weavers) but only one Shuttle. 

When two or more wizards weave a spell, they roll 1d6 for each applied Thread and 2d6 for the Shuttle. 5 or 6 = successful. 

For every other action where failure is possible, roll 1d6. 5 or 6 = successful.
 
If three 6s or more, the Fates come and cut one of the Threads used.
 
When you experiment the true meaning of something, you gain a related Thread.

# Cold Hearted
```
Cold Hearted: A game of relationships and Indescribable horror in the arctic.

You are researchers who have uncovered something in the ice. In the base, tensions are running high.

Have everyone sit in a circle and give everyone three cards, face down. Place a bottle in the middle of the table. Give yourself a name,make it visible.

Starting the oldest player going clockwise, take turns spinning the bottle. When it lands on someone (Respin if it lands on you) choose one:

1. Tell a secret
2. Proposition alone time
3. Accuse another

If they go choose to believe or go along with you, flip a card face up,marking down their name. If this card is discarded, the player marked on it discards one of their cards instead.   

If they choose otherwise you discard a card. Depending on how many cards you have left, they narrate your encounter with the horror.

2: Something isn't right
1: A terrifying glimpse
0: Death

If you land on someone who has no cards left, discard 2 cards, and follow the discard step above. 

When only one person is left, the next person they land on narrates either their escape or their death. 

```

# Bad Roommate
```
Bring your friends to a trashcan. A public dumpster is best, but make do with what you've got. 

Take something out of the trash can and choose a player. That player is your bad roommate. Accuse your bad roommate: "I cannot believe you threw this away!"

Explain, with appropriate outrage, why you cannot believe that the targeted player threw out the thing (a solo cup, an empty pill bottle, a shoe with a hole in it?).



The cup was from your first date with your dead husband.

You were going to build a tiny car out of that pill bottle.

You needed to wear that old shoe to a job interview at NASA. (They only take disheveled people seriously over there.)



Keep ranting about its importance until the bad roommate picks something else out of the trash and accuses another player of throwing away THEIR stuff.

"Look, sorry I didn't realize this stupid cup was important to you, but WHAT is my award-winning replica of a CVS receipt doing in the trash can?"

When everyone has taken a turn, say "Well we can't bring all of this stuff home." Collectively agree on one item to keep. The item wins.
