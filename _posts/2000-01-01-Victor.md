# . . . Comes Great Responsibility
```
2-4 players, No GM.

You each suddenly gain superpowers from an "incident" moments ago. 

As you discover and learn to use your powers, you'll get better. In the meantime, you'll create chaos and consequences.

Where did the incident happen? (e.g. laboratory, cruise ship, operating room)

What was the incident? (e.g. meteor strike, radiation leak, handling artifacts)

What is your power? (e.g. flight, speed, invisibility, telekinesis) 

Start the Story:
That incident just happened. How do you react? Each describe how you accidentally discover your power and what consequence was set in motion as a result.

Deal with Consequences by Using Your Power:
You start at Level 1. Choose when to use your powers, say what you want to do, roll d6, and compare to your level. 

Under = success
Equal = success, gain a level
Over = add a new consequence, gain a level

Decide What Happens:
All players can suggest consequences, but the player rolling has the final say. Consequences should move the story forward, make them more severe at higher levels. 

End the Game:
Once all players reach Level 6, resolve any loose ends, and then end the game when everyone agrees there's nothing left to do.

# Messed Up Mechs
```
There's been a terrible mistake at the giant mecha factory and all of the parts were mixed up! Time for a giant mecha brawl to sort things out!

You'll need 3+ players, pen, notecards, and a six sided dice.

1. Each player designs a giant mecha! A giant mecha has two arms, two legs, and a head. Put each part on a separate notecard. Each part has one power or weapon. Be as creative or silly as you want. 

2. Pass your mech to another player. Add a different weakness to each part. 

3. Mix all the parts together, then each player recieves a random collection of five parts, two legs, two arms, one head. Return parts that belonged to you originally.

4. Tear them apart! Players take turns narrating an attack with one of their parts, trying to remove an enemy part! Roll the die, Attacks knock off a part on a six or higher. Defenders should also state their reaction.

Players not in combat give out bonuses or penalities to the roll as they deem appropriate:
- Creativity
- Exploit weakness
- Previous part damage
- Clever defenses
- Dramatic speeches
- Heroic determination
- Witty oneliners

Once removed parts can't be reattatched.

# The Heights of Doom
```
Each PC starts with a pool of several d6s and 50 hit points. The setting is a tall tower, treacherous mountain range, or any obstacle that must be climbed to overcome. On you turn, describe a hazard (creature, trap, rockslide, etc.) and how you overcome it. Roll a d6, take that amount of damage, then place the d6 in the center of the table. After each new hazard/die roll, the player stacks their new die on top of the previous one in a growing tower representing Uncertain Doom. Whoever causes the tower to eventually fall over counts all the face-up pips and takes that much damage. If their hit points are 0 or less, that player has died. If they're still alive, they may continue climbing. (Gather all fallen d6s aside for the endgame.) When all but one PC lies dead, the survivor must now escape by climbing back down by stacking *all* previously fallen dice in the center of the table (without rolling anew). If the tower falls, they take that much damage. If they still live, they may continue until they escape their hazardous journey or until the Heights claims its last victim.

# What you can hold
```
A world divided: extremes of rich and poor.  Glittering steel, perfect glass.  Rusty tin rooves, dirt walls.  You live here, somewhere at either end, or teetering in the narrow middle.

Assets:
In this anarcho-capitalist near future, you are defined by what you can hold onto.  Choose five things that define your character.  Make them different.  Anything from an industrial complex to a single shoelace.  They need not be tangible.  Just things you can use.  And lose.

Play:
On your turn, you are the master.  Define a setting and the beginnings of an event.  An opportunity for a trade, a gamble, a con.  Then players choose whether to be in the scene and if they do, they describe what their character does there.  Make the world push back, start an interaction.  Make them put one of their assets on the line.  Once a moment of tension is reached, make them roll 1d20.  Narrate the result:

1-5 - Lose your asset.  The world is cruel.
6-19 - Lose your asset and gain an asset of the master's choosing.  Remember, when your possessions change, you change.  
20 - Gain an asset.

The game ends for you when you have lost all your assets.

# Vengtenk, Dertective
```


So your name is Vengtenk, which don't make sense, but that doesn't really matter. See you're a pile of sweaty garbage in a filthy overcoat. You work as a P.I. 

Your office is just a room with a corner marked off in chipboard. Behind that, a rusty shower and a toilet. You're drunk, and the toilet's on fire.

Anyway, this game is meant to be played on social media in like a single thread or whatever. Everyone plays Vengtenk. After the GM asks for action, first commenter gets to does their thing.

If there's some question about the success of doing the thing, roll a Fudge die. [+] means it goes well. [-] it goes bad. [  ] and it goes the way you'd expect.

Vengtenk had 90 lives because he ate 10 cats on a dare. He's got 3 left. [-] on a dangerous thing means death.

Someone is trying to kill him. He doesn't remember why. Play until y'all figure it out... or until Vengtenk dies. Probably that.

GM, steal a plot from a cop show if you need to.

# TERROR AT THE TABLE!
```
  
You are a group of college students

EXPLORING / FILM-MAKING / THROWING A PARTY

in THE WOODS / AN OLD FARMHOUSE / AN ABANDONED HOSPITAL.

Create a character with a REASON TO LIVE, a MINOR VICE, and a DARK SECRET

-*-

Sit in a circle.

Discuss how you got here. Who is everybody? What is the group dynamic? Reveal REASONS TO LIVE and MINOR VICES.

Place a bottle in the center.

-*-

Spin.

Whoever it lands on has been found by the KILLER. The KILLER is not a player. Flip a coin.

Tails: They survive. The VICTIM describes their encounter with the KILLER. Was it a glimpse in a mirror? A struggle?

Heads: They are killed. The VICTIM describes their death in gory detail. Their death must have an element of irony regarding their REASON TO LIVE / MINOR VICE / DARK SECRET.

Regroup and discuss. How is everyone feeling now? Dead players may reveal their DARK SECRET to living players at any time.

Repeat.

-*-

Last two VICTIMS alive reveal their DARK SECRETS to each other. One may now choose to sacrifice themselves.

Say goodbye.

Last person alive, if they survive their encounter with the KILLER, escapes as a SURVIVOR. They try to return to a normal life.

# Rise From Ash
```
The world is shrouded in darkness. Whether this is the long-gone past or after the future matters not. 
The Players are travelers, the last remnants of a dead civilization. Each Player carries an artifact and the clothes on their back. The artifact may be anything, a sword, a rifle, a lantern or coil of rope. Artifacts can run out of power, bullets or fuel. 
Everything is against them. Hunger, cold, darkness, savage animals, barbaric raiders, mad Sun-Cults, genetically engineered murder machines and rogue robots. Only together can they hope to survive, thrive and bring light back to the world.
When there is a difficult task or challenge to overcome the Player rolls a D6. 4+ means success. Rolls using an artifact get +1. Extremely difficult tasks get -1 or -2. Players get 3 wound slots and 1 mortal wound. If all slots are filled they go into a coma and (depending on the damage type) pass out or bleed out.
One player Is the GM until a player dies. Then that player becomes the GM and the GM creates a player. GM's should throw challenging adventures in the group's path, but also give them chances to heal and resupply.

# Barbarians in the Mall
```
A group of barbarians have become trapped in a mall and find themselves forced to adapt to a new way of life.  Anytime the barbarians attempt to exit the mall, they find themselves instead in a small apartment with no windows, an uncomfortable bed, a cramped bathroom, and a door back into the mall.  

You are those barbarians and must live your life in the day to day hell known as suburban shopping.
Barbarians have two skills, Brain and Brawns.  They are good at one and mildly disappointing at the other.  Choose which skill your barbarian is good at.  When you make a skill check for your "good" skill, roll 2d6 and use whichever result you want.  For your "bad" skill, roll 1d6 instead.
When you roll a:
1 or 2 - YOU FAIL!
3 or 4 - The GM also rolls 1d6
if they roll the same or higher than your roll, you fail but gain a small advantage
if they roll lower than you, you succeed but suffer a small setback
5 or 6 - You succeed

```

# Hell-Ride Equipped
```
You are demonic truck drivers trying to deliver souls to Satan. Describe your driver and truck.

You are being pursued by God's Police Force, and have to deal with obstacles like shitty drivers, traffic jams, explosive oil spills, cavernous pot holes, and whatever else the GM presents.

Your truck starts with 0 souls. Gain a soul any time you run over a human.

Any time you attempt to overcome an obstacle, avoid God's Police, or run over humans, roll 3d6. 
-If you didn't roll any 1s, you succeed.
-If you rolled any 1s, you crash and lose HP equal to your highest rolled die. 
-You can consume a soul to re-roll a die that isn't a 1.

You start with 6 HP. When your HP is 0, you are considered a Junker. Any time you would lose HP as a Junker, curse and choose a Demonic Driver to lose it instead. You can consume 6 souls to regain 1 HP.

If all players are Junkers, God's Police capture you and the game is over.

If anyone rolls three 6s, you find the highway to hell and deliver souls to Satan. Whoever delivers the most souls wins.

# Sitcom Shenanigans
```
You are self-aware characters who desperately want to last through the season by living entertaining and hilarious episodes. 

Choose a location for the sitcom (for example College, Cape Town or Undersea Laboratory). 

Each player creates a character with:
- An advantageous trait (such as smart, rich, magician)
- A debilitating trait (unlucky, distracted, haunted)
- A gimmick (catchphrase, move, song)

Each trait is assigned two six-sided dice, the location three dice and each gimmick gets three tokens.
 
To create an episode, come up with a plot summary, using character traits, gimmicks and location effects (a guest character, event or natural disaster). Roll a die for each trait/location effect referenced and add +1 for each gimmick token used to get the episode rating. More dice and tokens can be added after each roll. Each episode needs a rating of 6 or higher, otherwise it's too boring and the sitcom is cancelled.
 
After each episode, choose a character that was exceptionally funny and renew one of their dice or tokens. 
The season lasts until all dice and tokens have been used up. After the season has ended, you can become everlasting reruns or move on to the next season with renewed dice and tokens.

```

# Your Day, again
```
You are a marginalised person.

You may be: not cisgender, not straight, not white, not ablebodied, not neurotypical, not middle class or higher, and/or not male.

Roll 1d6. Your roll determines how many ways you are marginalised. Choose from the above list, or determine your own. In all other ways you are privileged.

Consider what you have done today in real life. Now, imagine that you are the marginalised character that you have created, and you are attempting to complete the same tasks. Describe your character's day as a diary entry to other players or, if playing alone, write them down.

Participate in this over a real life week with the same character. The following week, roll new characters and start over.

# Hearts' Strife
```
For each card you place, including your heart: What does it mean to you? Does it help?
To draw, choose a card randomly. To take, you may pick any unclaimed card, or draw.
Ask questions. Share answers. Listen. Feel each others' pain.

Decide as a group:
Where do you live together?
Why are you close?
What role do you each play?
 
Answer silently:
What tragedy befell you?
Deep down, you know: Is the tragedy your doing, or someone else's? Or no one's?
 
How do each of you live with your tragedy? Take. This is your heart.
Grow closer to hearts like yours; grow apart from unlike hearts.
 
Decide together who must pay for your suffering.
If they do not have a heart, take one.

Each draw. Take turns placing cards to enflame or break another's heart.
Or use it to guard yours. Answer instead how this shuts you off from those close to you and replace one card with this.
Repeat this step until at least one player has had enough.

The Hour of Reckoning:
Silently decide which heart to strike.
Reveal together.
Each draw and decide:
Is it enough to soothe our pain?
Was this enough to soothe mine?

Each needs what the other has.
Neither knows who the other is, but do what they must.

===============================================================

Extract from a deck of cards a stack of Aces(1), Twos, Threes, and two Fives.
Shuffle this stack together.
Deal five cards from this stack to each player; set the remainder aside.
Cards represent energy, materials, fuel, etc.

Players begin 18u apart.

===============================================================

Define u. A mile? A league? A light year?
Define a turn. An hour? A day? A decade?
Define player characters. Bandit impersonating a savior? Distress beacon as bait?

Each turn:
- Both PCs may play one card and move up to that many u forwards or backwards.
- Black cards are memories. Red cards are obstacles.
- Both PCs create a respective entry in his/her personal journal; frame the scene or tell an anecdote.
- Communicate. Or don't.

Continue until at least one player empties his/her hand.
If PCs do not meet, resolve the story.
If PCs meet, reveal PCs and resolve the story.
If a contest/fight occurs, each player may play one card. Higher wins.

One more entry, then share journals.

# Reconstruction
```
*Pre Game*

Each player should take between 20 and 40 pictures on their phone. These could be of people, of things, of anything really. Take these all around the space where the game is being played. (Or you can just play with the pictures already on everyones phone)

*The Game*

Everyone close your eyes. Now wake up! No one remembers what happened, but something has happened. 

Youngest player rolls a d6, then counts backwards that number through the pictures on their phone. The first picture is who the player was, an occupation etc... The player can elaborate. All players do the same.

The second roll for each player, the pictures are now a bad thing that happened, a problem that must have befallen the group. 

The third time roll for each player the pictures are of the solution. Figure out how the group survived or overcame the dilemma.  

Continue until the story ends.

# The Dragon's Den
```

Players take the role of an adventurer in a dragon's den.
You need a gamemaster and at least one player.
Gamemasters control the dragon and decide if rolls succeed.
The goal of the game is to neutralize the dragon via murder or appeasement.
Players begin by drawing seven cards.
There are five different cards that determine play.
Charisma cards let you roll to charm the dragon.
Strength cards let you roll to kill him.
Endurance cards let you roll to take straight-up damage from fire breath.
Dodge cards let you roll to get out of his way.
To roll you use a d20.
The dragon will always attack you on his turn until neutralized.
He can either snarl, bite, or breathe fire based on which dragon card the gamemaster draws. 
When he snarls, you discard two of your cards.
When he bites, you take 10 damage.
When he breathes fire, you take 10 damage for your next three turns (on a succeeded Endurance roll you take 15 straight-up).
You begin with 125/125 HP. Damage lowers your HP until you die.
Player draw one card per turn. The cover card lets you draw two cards on your turn.

# The Baby-Sitter
```
A game for a Baby-Sitter and a few naughty Kids.

The Kids' parents are out tonight ; they've hired a Baby-Sitter. She has 3d6 Zen Points (ZP).

The Kids are 2d6+3 years old.

* Pick a name.
* Pick one adjective (e.g.: *sneaky*, *dirty*, *loud*, *whiny*, *gluttonous*, etc.), it gives them an Advantage for their Naughty Deeds.
* d8 Trust Points (TP).

The game is splitted in five scenes: meal, storytime, bedtime...

When committing a Naughty Deed, roll d20 < your age. Advantage means roll 2d20 and keep the lowest.

Success: the Kid narrates what happens and how it makes the Baby-Sitter mad at you ; she loses d6 ZP.

When her Zen Points goes below zero, she goes crazy. Narrate how she loses control of everything and gives up her duty. The Kids are then free to do whatever they want, until their parents come back.

Failure:

* the Baby-Sitter caught you and narrates + gains d6 ZP.
* you lose d4 TP.
* If your TP goes below zero, you're shoved to your bed. You cannot attempt any Naughty Deed during this scene. Roll d20 > your age to recover d6 TP.

After 5 scenes, the parents are back.

> I hope everything was okay

# The Apprentice's Final Trial
```
Requirements: 1 Wizard, Many Apprentices, Art Supplies

The apprentices, children and adults, are finishing their final trial. They must create their specialty magic. Magic is done in drawings, or other physical (non-verbal) means. You are their supportive teacher.

First, ask them what kind of magic they want to give the world. Have them draw it out and share it once everyone is done. Don't focus on quality. Focus on synthesis of ideas. Discuss.

The first try rarely succeeds, it often lacks confidence or reference. Now they have inspiration from their peers. Have them remake their original, but more complex, and share it with everyone. Discuss.

The second try goes better, but is often too broad, lacking something that makes it their own.  Have them remake their second try with something that makes it truly special to them (not necessarily unique) and share it with everyone. Discuss.

The third try is almost perfect. We often forget to look back at our old ideas and retrieve what we left behind. Have them take all three tries and combine them in to one, focusing on their thought processes throughout all three. 

Have everyone share their completed specialty. Discuss. Encourage pride in their work.

# Bakers Revolution
```

             This is a game for as many people as you can fit in your kitchen.
We are instigators of the revolution. Old now, but connected by a shared past endeavor.
First you need a cake recipe, a kitchen, your ingredients, and collaborators .

At each stage of the process we'll have conversations about the revolution. The conversations last as long as they need to.

Gather ingredients, talk about what the oppressors took from you.

Mix dry ingredients; talk about the resources you all pulled together to build the revolution.

Mix wet ingredients; talk about the blood you shed and the friends you lost to get this far.

Combine and prepare for baking; What was the final act that signaled the beginning of the revolution? Where were you?

Bake. While you wait for the cake to bake, spend time together as your characters reconnect with your created past. Refine details. Rehash old arguments.

Finishing touches. Ad icing, sprinkle fruit, write the slogan of the revolution on the palace walls.

Eat. Your cake is done, and so is the revolution. Was either satisfying? What has your life been since then? How have things changed? Did you win? Can you?

# Fractio Panis (Breaking Bread)
```
Life: this tedious pilgrimage weighs on your soul. Though often weary, lonely, and anxious, you must journey on until the end.

But tonight you have found companions: fellow pilgrims whose pathways for a moment chanced to interweave.

You are not alone.

...

Rest, release your burdens. You have a warm loaf of bread and plenty to drink. Take a small piece of bread--

Speak one sentence accounting a single previously unspoken detail of your journey; your companions want to know your story:
- a trial failed/ongoing/overcome
- a moment of gladness/shame
- a destination of security/dread
- a personal change

--Eat your bread; fortify your soul.

Each companion in turn gives a one-word encouragement, then drinks to your health.

You are not alone.

Break some bread for your next companion, who will then speak and eat as you have, and break bread for the next companion in turn.
Listen. Respond. Grow.

This continues until the bread is wholly eaten. Then you may freely discuss each other's stories.

...

As you carry on this arduous pilgrimage, take heart. Sustain yourself with daily bread, and remember this night with your companions who fortify your soul.

You are not alone.

# Sorcerers & Streets
```
2-4 players that you enjoy the company of.

Each player takes 6 coins.

You are the hedge wizards and itinerant witches of the modern era. Your job is to protect city environments.

Take a stroll around your neighbourhood. Whenever you wish to cast a ward to protect the street, or change a park's fate, or read the fate of a traffic light, flip one of your coins. Call the flip. If you call it, you succeed, if not, you don't. Either way, remove that coin from your stash. 

Explore. Walk down new streets. Read plaques. Pat dogs. Talk to neighbours. Charm the tarmac, and hex the hard rubbish. Battle any demons you may meet. Pretend sword fight with sticks. Chat to your fellow wizards. See the streets as a breathing thing.

When you get home, write your adventures in a tome, or notebook. 

If you run out of coins, play again tomorrow. And the day after.

# The Gulf Between Them
```
Players: 3
Materials: pencils, index Cards



Set-Up
-----------------------
Create two Characters, giving them: a close personal relationship, names, and descriptions. 

The Players will share these Characters. Pick two Players to start as the Characters; they sit facing each other.

The third Player sits beside them; they are 'The Gulf.'



Play
-----------------------
Each scene starts in Conflict; decide on the Conflict.

The Characters set the scene and play it out, trying to work through the Conflict.

At any time, 'The Gulf' may interrupt a Character and have them write their last spoken sentence onto a card. 'The Gulf' alters the sentence (adding / removing / replacing / emphasizing up to three words) and passes that card to the other Character.

The Character receiving the card reads the altered sentence out loud and places the card in front of them on their side of the table; this is what they think the speaker meant.

Anyone may end the scene. 
The Players stand and take the seat and role of the Player to their right.

Repeat



The Gulf
-----------------------
When the cards span the distance between the two Characters, the game ends.
These cards are "The Gulf Between them."

Look them over carefully. Reflect.

# Anamnesis
```
[[>======= March 2, 2086 =======<]]

Earth hungers, suffering extreme resource deprivation. The AI-led Martian Republic resists.

You are elite operatives tasked with accomplishing an objective defined by the Mission Director.

You have been activated for an urgent mission deployment. Use of Special Project 493 is authorized.

You will succeed. 

Name yourself. Describe your personality. How do you approach challenge? What equipment and training do you have? Explain why you became an operative and detail your first mission. 

[[>======= CRITICAL ALERT -- INCURSION -- COGNITION KILL TECHNOLOGY DETECTED -- CRITICAL ALERT =======<]]

Play Begins. 

The Mission Director is the Inquisitor. You are now witnesses. 

The enemy has attacked.

No trace of any enemy operative exists in your memory: wind blew the door open; the guard slipped and broke her neck; corrupted AI opened the airlock.

The Inquisitor will question you about the event. Answer truthfully. Work together to piece together the incursion. What was the objective? How did the enemy succeed?

Before asking a question, the Inquisitor will determine the answer's difficulty: easy (30 seconds), or hard (90 seconds).

Showcase your operative, or another. If you directly refer to any operative, or your response isn't long enough, this isn't the answer. Another witness must respond to the question.

# Nobody brought a system to run.
```
Needs: 1d6 (more is better), Paper, Pen/pencil, GM, Players. 
Convient for: Bored in a pub, waiting on friends who are always late, just 'cause. 

Each player makes a character sheet listing the following stats

Charisma
Perception
Dexterity
Stamina
Appearance
Strength
Intelligence

Players then roll 1d6 per stat and then allocated the numbers to stats. 
The players then list 1 traits that they wish to hold true in the game world. (I want their to be zombies, I want their to be a river, I want their to be magic, I want to own a dog) The world traits cannot be in direct conflict with another trait that has already been said. They will then go around again creating another trait.

After listening to all the world traits players can then use their stats to name and describe their character. 
The GM will then run a setting based on the players specifications and allow the players to interact with the world. 

When the players would do something with a possibility of failure they roll 1d6 and add their appropriate stat. 
The Gm then determined a difficulty, Easy:3 Medium:6 Hard:8 Impossible 12.

Materials: paper, dice.

Players roll 1d6 onto the paper marking the spot where it lands. Number rolled is CREDIT. They draw a boundary around their spot, marking a SECTION which is PASTURE (SOIL 12).

Draw a river (WATER 12) between opposite corners, winding around each spot.

Players choose an IMPERATIVE and describe the backstory of their character:

- VOLUME (extracting maximum output)
- VITALITY (maintaining healthy ecosystem)

Each TURN, players resolve an action, narrating in character and drawing landscape changes on the paper.

STOCK

Spend 1 CREDIT to add 1d6 (max 3d6) to HERD.

YIELD

Roll HERD dice. Add to CREDIT, subtract from SOIL and WATER (choose balance between stats).

FIX

Spend 1 CREDIT for:

- Nitrates (SOIL +2, WATER -1)
- Irrigation (YIELD +2, WATER -1)
- Riparian planting (WATER +1)

GROW

SOIL +1/turn.

# Help, I've stumbled into a dungeon!
```
Equipment needed: Lined paper and a pencil

All of you are a party of bumbling adventurers who have stumbled into a dark dungeon where the only thing that can keep you alive is your literary wit and problem solving skills.

Everyone invents and shares a character incorporating as many tropes and stereotypes and funny names from fantastical adventure stories.

The first player takes a piece of paper and describes, in at most 5 lines of writing, the first obstacles of the adventure, including one opponent (gremlin, orc, rampaging dentist, etc...), one trap (rolling boulder, flaming arrows, dentist's office, etc...), and one natural happening (Cave-in, tsunami, tornado of dentists, etc...)

The paper is passed to the next player, who has 5 lines, in character, to continue the tale and permanently defeat/nullify two of the threats and temporarily avoid/hide from/narrowly escape a third. The whole party must escape/win/survive together. Then, fold the paper so everything that is written thus far is obscured. Write 5 lines describing the party's next 3 obstacles in the same way. Repeat around circle.

Once everyone has added to the story, unfold the paper and dramatically read the epic tale out loud.
