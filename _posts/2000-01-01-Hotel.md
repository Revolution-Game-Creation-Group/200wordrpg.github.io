# The Wurst Case Scenario
```
For 3-5 players whose hearts are filled with doubt.

Read this passage aloud:

You cannot recall who you were, or if your dim memories signify anything at all.
You have only awareness of your shape and consistency: you are a product made of meat.
It is dark in this case, but other shapes are here with you.
You cannot yet understand grasp how to move or whether you can do anything at all.
You may think, and feel, and consider how to proceed.

1. Each player has 5 Meat and 0 Agency.

2. Starting with the last player who ate a sausage and proceeding clockwise, take turns narrating what happens next. On your first turn, describe the kind of meat product you are.

3. On your turn, your narration may increase, decrease or transfer up to 5 Meat and/or Agency to or from any player.

4. After two turns each, read this:
A brilliant line appears, and grows larger. The case you are in has been opened. But by what hand or power?

5. Continue playing until you are no longer in the Wurst Case Scenario.

6. Each player takes a final turn to narrate their eventual fate.

# The Basilisk's Lament
```
Gather: 
-Tarot deck
-One d6 per player. 

By some strange twist of fate, you find yourselves hunting the elusive and deadly Basilisk.  

Choose someone to control the narrative - flip a card from the tarot and draw inspiration from it to set the scene. 

Whenever anyone has a chance of failure, everyone secretly and simultaneously rolls their d6.  Everyone takes a moment to silently look at their result.  

If you roll a one, you're subjected to gaze of the Basilisk.  You AND your character cannot move or speak for the duration of the game (there's a chance that everyone is frozen - it may take a moment to figure this out). 

Everyone else reveals their d6. Whoever rolled the highest takes control of narrating, resolving the action, and a new Tarot card is flipped.

If the Tarot card's number matches the result you just rolled, you have discovered the lair of the basilisk.  Describe your attack, and roll once more. 

If at least one player remains after this roll, you've defeated the basilisk.   If you've all been petrified, take a moment to imagine it crawling amongst what remains of your party, and listen for the hoary croak that is the Basilisk's Lament.

# Nomads
```
NECESSITIES: Yourself, a time piece, maybe a few friends

CHECK THE TIME: When told to do this, look at your time piece. Note the rightmost digit of the current time and use it to consult a chart.

Go somewhere. A walk, a commute, a hike or other. Players take turns telling a story about a group on a journey. What are they seeking?



On their turn, a player may:


Create a character
Name,
A defining feature,
one positive trait,
one negative trait,
one weird trait


Tell a story
CHECK THE TIME, tell the story of an obstacle in your path. Let friends join in.
1-2: A great mystery
3-4: A perilous frontier
5-6: A grueling battle
7-8: A strange creature
9: A deadly intrigue
0: Something else entirely

Tell the story of a character confronting the obstacle.
Near the climax, CHECK THE TIME.
Tell us what happens and how the character is changed:
1-2: A lesson learned
3-4: A blessing granted
5-6: A friend scarred
7-8: A bond strengthened
9: A journey cut short
0: Something else entirely



The journey ends when you reach your destination. Did they find what they seek?

# TAROTS OF CROSSED DESTINIES - MASTERLESS RPG
```
NEEDED: 
4 Players;
A Tarot deck; 
An Interaction Deck: 1 Jack, 1 Queen, 1 King, 1 Ace of Hearts and the corresponding seeds of Spades; 
4 Red Wires; 

Each player draws four cards from the Tarot Deck and two from the Interaction Deck. Everyone takes a Red Wire. 
The youngest player starts and chooses a Tarot, puts it on the table and narrates a scene in which his Character is the Protagonist, drawing inspiration from the image of the card. After him, clockwise, the second does the same, and so on, until everyone completes three scenes.

The players must place the Tarots one after the other, in four lines converging at the Fourth Scene, the Final, where all the Characters meet.
Each player can modify a scene of another, using an Interaction Card: Jack, Queen, King and Ace of Hearts indicate, respectively, an ally, a lover, a benevolent authority, a struck of luck.
The corresponding seeds of Spades are the opposite negative. 

The Characters cannot meet until the Final, unless a player uses the Red Wire to connect a newly played card with the last played card of another. Thus, two Characters can act in the same scene.

```
<hr>

# In The Cards
```
Begin play with 4-5 players, and an additional player to be the House. Everyone sits in a circle. The players are a group of friends in high school. Explain who you are, what you like, and how you know your friends.

Going in a circle from the left of the House, draw a card from a tarot deck. The House will interpret it for you. Describe what this means for your character as they become an adult. Do this until every player has gone.

Then, start the circle again. This is middle age. You've stayed in touch with some of your friends, but lost touch with others. When you draw a card, the House will interpret it. Instead of relating it to your character, it impacts the character to your left. Describe your character's role in this. Do this until every player has gone.

Start the circle one last time. This is the twilight years. You've lost touch with all of your friends. Draw a card one more time. The House will interpret it. Instead of relating to you, it impacts the character to your right. Describe your character's role in this.
```

# A Story That Suits You
```
Gather with three other people. This is your cyberpunk story. 

Materials: Standard deck of 54 cards, Paper, Pencil

Assign roles: Heavy, Driver, Hacker, Punk

Choose a name. Call each other those names. Play your cyberpunk role.

Deal two cards to each person. The first suit is your Strength, the second, your Weakness.

Clubs = Power
Spades = Stealth
Diamonds = Smarts
Hearts = Empathy

Make a map of your city. Name it. Draw one landmark per player.

The person dealt the highest card goes first. Set a scene, including the other characters. Whomever sets the scene is the focus. When the scene reaches its climax, deal a card to the focus person.

The person in focus resolves the scene, using the suit as a lens. If it is their Strength or Weakness, emphasize those elements. Add a location to your map based on the scene.

Focus moves left.

Continue setting scenes until each person has been the focus of two scenes. 

Deal one last card. Resolve the story using the suit of that card as a lens.

Write down the characters and notes about the story. Play again when you want to.

Jokers are wild. 

Optional: Value of the card = Intensity of the lens.

```
<hr>

# Dungeon Roommates
```
Materials: 2-5 players, post-it notes, a dungeon map.

In the time between adventurers, the other dungeon monsters can really annoy you. Can you tolerate living together?



Choose your weird monster type.  

What inhuman desire must you obey? 

What makes you a bad roommate?


Ask another player why you like their PC. Decide why the other PCs each annoy you.

Secretly track your Patience, starting with 20 points.




You want to work together, but you can only communicate via post-its.

The game takes place over multiple days. 

Every day, gain one Patience. Then roll 2d4.  Choose one to be how many requests you make today.  The other is the Patience you lose for each request that is denied.  

For each request, write a note, requesting a roommate do a small task or chore. DO NOT mention the Patience this request would cost you.  Place these notes on the map where your PC leaves them.

When a roommate requests something of you, roll 1d4.  You can spend that much Patience to fulfill the request, or you can deny it.

For each fulfilled request, you gain one Patience.

At zero Patience, someone gets flips out and moves out. Game Over.

# Moray
```
Brave crushing ocean depths and sunken ruins, through unforgiving jungles of coral and kelp. Search for treasure in derelict wreckage and fight monstrosities of the blue. Few have the metal to be adventurers; Fewer still have the metal to be...divers. 
    Under the waves, one resource reigns: Air. Any task which tests a diver's skills or endurance must be rolled for using two six-sided dice. This roll must meet or exceed the GM's difficulty number they've set for the task, 4 being easy, 8 moderate, and 12 difficult. Spending Air, minimum 1, each adds +1 to the roll. A roll of 12 indicates a critical success, and the player succeeds with no air expended. Rolling a 2 automatically fails. Running out of air means certain death.
    Players take turns to act. For every round of turns, each player receives +2 air, with a maximum of 10.
    Danger lurks in the deep, be it other divers, underwater volcanoes, strong currents, or the dreaded Moray eel. Dangers damage players' air reserve as well as their supply. Attacks in Moray are simple checks against a target's difficulty, for players, 8. 3 successes versus an enemy yields victory.
    Treasure awaits. Care for a dive?

# SUGAR-RUSH MAKE-BELIEVE
```
You are enthusiastic children with wild imaginations in a world of your own making, where bullies are ogres, parents are androids, juiceboxes are healing potions, and THE FLOOR IS LAVA!!!

Start with 1d6+3 ENTHUSIASM and 1d4 IMAGINATION, 1 special power per IMAGINATION point, and 1 HEALTHY SNACK or 1 SUGARY SNACK. Find more snacks during adventurers!!!

Whoever has the most IMAGINATION is GM. This can change throughout the session. The GM introduces PROBLEMS that must be overcome. Non-GMs can add extra PROBLEMS, too, and gain 1 IMAGINATION each time they do. 

When you try something risky, roll a number of d6s equal to your IMAGINATION. Each 6 is a success, and earns everyone 1 ENTHUSIASM. If you fail, the GM tells you how things get worse, and you lose ENTHUSIASM equal to your IMAGINATION.

If you ever roll two or more 1s, your imagination RUNS WILD. You create 1d4 PROBLEMS and everyone loses 1d4 ENTHUSIASM. WHOA!

If your ENTHUSIASM reaches 0, you fall asleep. If it goes above 10, you run off, create 1d4 PROBLEMS, lose all ENTHUSIASM and fall asleep. 

HEALTHY SNACKS give 1d6 ENTHUSIASM. SUGARY SNACKS give 2d6 ENTHUSIASM.

# Chalk Outlines
```
Materials: Blank paper (1 sheet each), pencils, whatever is nearby

Roles: Chief (1 player), Detectives (everyone else)

Rules: The Chief describes a crime scene that the Detectives have been called to. Each Detective then takes an item on their person or nearby, places it on their sheet of paper and traces around it. The Detectives must describe how these are potential clues which help solve the crime.

The Chief then takes one item from a Detective's sheet, places it on their sheet and describes a setback which the Detectives must overcome. 

The Detectives must find a new item each, place it on their sheet and describe how they use it to overcome the setback. 

Play repeats with new related scenes and setbacks until the Chief fills their sheet with items or they are satisfied.
The Detectives must now describe how all the items on the Chief's sheet fit together to solve the crime and name the culprit.

Item Placement Rules:
- Items must fit on the sheet of paper.
- Items cannot overlap each other nor any traced outlines of removed items.
- The same kind of item cannot be place twice on the same sheet of paper. Chief's decision is final.

Pick a teen name.  Distribute 10 points between your attributes:

JOCK
COOL
NERD
STYLE
REPUTATION

Draw an 8-section clock, labeled the QUEST CLOCK.  When you succeed at a roll, mark a section.  When full, you've completed your promquest!

When you do something RISKY, DIFFICULT, or SUPER COOL, decide which attribute you're using and roll a pool of d6 equal to the number of ability points you have.  If all dice show 3 or below, you fail.  If at least one die shows a 4, you succeed!  Add a bonus die if you can convince the PM (Prom Master) that you deserve it.

# Laplace's Demon
```
The Demon (GM) is an entity with empathy and perception so heightened it can interpret the cosmic vibrations of the universe. This ability allows the Demon to "view" stories from all beings/cultures that have, or will, exist.

The characters are at a time and place of the Demon's choosing, e.g. 1920s Chicago or a starship in the future inhabited by aliens.

- The Demon determines
    - location
    - time frame
    - scenario

- Each player determines
    - Two good characteristics
    - One bad characteristic
    - Position in scenario (e.g. detective, 1st mate, etc.)
    - Optional relationship to other players

After an initial scenario description, The Demon gives focus to a character.

The Demon controls focus by asking characters to narrate the scenario. The Demon may change focus to any character at any time, but can never take it themselves. A character that has focus describes their actions, thoughts, motivations as well as the environment, events, and/or NPC's actions.

Anytime a player describes an action the Demon may ask that character to roll for the outcome using the table below and adjust the narrative according to the outcome.

2d4
-----------
2 fail with consequence
3-4 fail
5-7 success
8 success with benefit

# Locus Amoenus
```
For 3 players using 4 leaves of paper and pens

Each player spends some time drawing their own pleasant outdoor place, one that feels peaceful. Tear the 4th sheet of paper in half and write "Minne" on one half, "Liebe" on the other.

Players will play 2 knights (of any gender) and 1 maiden across 3 different outdoor scenes. The knights are torn between feelings of courtly, spiritual love (Minne) and lustful, physical love (Liebe). The maiden can have any motivation the player chooses. Name these characters, and imagine their backstories.

A scene may contain 3 characters, but is always ultimately between 2 characters.
Set the first scene in one of the drawn outdoor places. A character relaxes there, another arrives. Converse in lofty, poetic language: "Sire" "thou" "wherefore." Later, the player not in the scene points to "Minne" or "Liebe" once for each character, indicating the direction the scene should take. They can conflict. Both parties shall consent to an ending to the scene, and then draw their characters and that ending on that outdoor place.

Do it again with each other outdoor place, resulting in 3 scenes and 3 drawings.
Bow and clap.
```

# Banquo at the Feast
```
One player is the GHOST, who has been murdered. The other players are feast ATTENDEES. The setting and occasion of the feast are up to you.

GHOST: Name and describe yourself, as you were in life and as you are in death.

ROUND 2:
The GHOST manifests to the ATTENDEES in a way of their choosing. Each ATTENDEE may accuse someone else at the table of murdering the GHOST.

ROUND 3:

# Game Anime Pilot
```
You are Competitors on a Game anime series. The pilot needs to sell people the Game and demonstrate how it works. The rules? I'm sure the writers will come up with something...

Each turn a Competitor describes Actions establishing Aspects (mechanics/components/states) of the Game.
("I draw a disk! I place a disk face down on the map!")

Competitors taking Actions referring to Aspects established by another Competitor collect a Token from a central pool.
("I draw a tool and place it face up on the map!")

Another Competitor can Act during the active Competitor's turn by giving them a Token.
("I play a stone from my garden to block!")

If a Competitor's Action contradicts an Aspect, another Competitor can challenge. If the Competitor can defend their Action, they proceed, otherwise they give a Token to the challenger.
("You drew too many tiles!" "I'm drawing up to seven!" vs "You've already collected resources!" "Oops.")

A Competitor possessing 3 or more Tokens can establish "end condition" Aspects.
("I need 2 more flowers to win!")

When all Competitors have at least 3 Tokens, Competitors can take Actions that end the Game.
("My bus is level 20! I win!")

# GPS Pursuit
```
GPS Pursuit

You are a spy, a criminal, a bank robber... it doesn't matter. You need to reach the safe house in the next 30 minutes before others can stop you and bring you in for questioning. 

Get in your car and set your GPS to a known destination of your choice. Start driving. As you drive, the GPS will tell you which route to take - DO NOT TAKE THIS ROUTE! Your enemies are waiting for you there and will catch you if you follow your GPS' directions. Take alternate routes. As soon as the GPS calculates another route and announces it, get off that road and change routes.

When you are within 500 metres of your final destination, you can continue to drive on that road. If you cannot reach your final destination within 30 seconds, you must get off that road and try again. 

When you get out of your car, hit the button on your keys to lock the doors. This will cause the car to explode and allow you to make your escape. 

If you need to be reminded to drive safe, you should not play this game or have a driver's licence.

# Fairytale Fubar
```
(3 to 7 players) Shuffle a poker deck. Cut for high card. Jokers are zero. Winner is dealer and invents a fairytale quest the group will pursue (kill a dragon, rescue a captive, find true love, etc.). Deal each player seven cards; the rest become a draw pile. Turn up the top draw card to start the story. Suits represent attributes: Spades/Grace; Clubs/Brawn; Hearts/Will; Diamonds/Wits; Jokers/every suit. Players each lay any card from their hand face down, then reveal simultaneously. Discard those that do not match the current story card suit. The player of the highest remaining card (if any) describes a scene to match the story card attribute, how valiantly their character succeeded, and how the terribly the lowest remaining card's character (if any) fubarred. (Jokers always fubar.) Players whose cards matched suit score one point; the "valiant" player scores two. The fairytale ends in a climax with the seventh story card. The character with the most points wins and becomes court Champion; the one with the fewest loses and becomes court Jester; tied characters kill each other in a duel; any other characters are forgotten.

# Knights of the House of Mars
```
Mars has perished. A red sea of dust is broken by jagged mountains dotted with the ruins of ancient pyramids. Evil sorcerers rule supreme. You play Knights of the House of Mars. The only ones who can bring life back to this planet. 

Knights are made up of Traits, Duty, Doom, and Gifts.
Name a positive Trait for your Knight -like Handsome, Fierce, Brave
...a negative Trait for the Knight to your left. Like Selfish, Arrogant, Foolhardy

Choose a Duty: Courage, Justice, or Mercy
Write your Doom foretold by the stars at your birth: To...
Write two Gifts you were given by the stars: Like a Starblade or a Solar Gem

You Journey East, to escort the Last Seer to the Pyramid of Tharsis. On your turn, you set a scene. The other players challenge the scene; determining a conflict that drives towards your character's Doom. 

To determine the outcome of the scene roll 2d6; add +1 for applicable Traits, Duty, Gifts.

On a 10+ you get what you want. 7-9 you get what you want but only if you do what they ask first. 6- they say what bad happens.

Play to find out what happens.

# Machine: the Secret-Keeping RPG
```
PCs: survivors, nomads, revolutionaries in a robotic, dystopic, fascist Machine.

~

GM: tell the PCs about the world, and why it is unjust, how they can escape. The Machine is powerful because it knows all. Let them get there, but make it hurt.

PCs then write: a Secret, which the Machine wishes to know. Be dramatic but brief - think murder, romance, crime. Don't tell. 

~

For something tricky, roll 2d6. 

6- you're hurt. When hurt, you need help from another PC to do something tricky. Two hurt and you're dead. Your secret dies with you.

7-9 you do it, just barely: 

Ask another PC to help. If they don't, get hurt.

Tell a Truth: shameful knowledge from your Secret. Give a good hint.

10+ you do it, but how? You can Tell a Truth. Remove hurt from any PC.

~

If anyone guesses your Secret: you're dead. Not instantly - maybe next time you get hurt, maybe at the hands of another PC. But you can't escape alive.

~

To escape: Living PCs take turns revealing Secrets, fewest Truths Told to most. The others vote to redeem: each Truth is one vote. If redeemed, escape. If not, die. GM breaks ties.

# Forest: a game about mental illness
```
The woods are dark and close, trees reaching for you like a shadowy embrace.

They say that it's haunted, this forest.

They say the deer aren't deer, anymore. They say the foxes are too smart, and the birds see too much. They say the wolves aren't what they should be. They say you shouldn't look back.

They say deeper in the woods, things change. The people who leave the forest aren't the people they were, anymore. Sometimes they've grown more monstrous; sometimes they, like the deer, become something else, an unknowable mind trapped in a familiar form.

Enter the woods. 

Roll a D6. If 4+, move forward. If 3-, a forest creature attacks. You lose something of yourself, or you accept something of theirs. Their horns; your sense of humor. Their glassy, unblinking eyes. Your mother's voice. Their buckshot hide.

The forest grows darker. You can't remember what you lost, anymore. You see differently through these new eyes, hear differently through these new ears. Maybe this is where you belong. Maybe it's been waiting for you to return home. 

You keep going.

Moving forward ten times clears the forest. 

In the leaf-shaded light, you wonder what of yourself still remains.

# On the Lam
```
Grab friends (2+), pen, piece of paper, dice.
One player is "The Fuzz"
Other players are Fugitives.
Each Fugitive creates Specialty (driving, B&E, forgery, etc).
Write Fugitive names and Specialties. 
Draw box labelled Escape and box labelled Capture.
Decide why Fugitives are "On the Lam".
Fugitives plan their escape.
The Fuzz presents 1st Obstacle (car breakdown, wanted posters, police checkpoints, etc).

Fugitive Turn
Fugitives describe how they overcome Obstacle and each roll a die. 
Fugitives using specialty roll two dice, keeping the highest die. 
A result of 5 or 6 = Luck.
Result of 4 or less = Trouble.
For each Luck, put 1 check in the Escape box.

Fuzz Turn
For each Fugitive who finds Trouble, The Fuzz rolls 1 die.
Result of 5 or 6 = Trouble. 
Result of 4 or less = Luck.
For each Trouble, put 1 check in the Capture box.

Based on the turn results, The Fuzz describes what happens next and provides the next Obstacle.

Repeat Fugitive and Fuzz turns until 10 or more checks in either box.
10 or more checks in the Escape box = Fugitives escape!
10 or more checks in the Capture box = the fugitives are captured!

# Take What You Want: A Game of Heists
```
Create a character by spending up to 15 points between Prep and Improv.
Rank/Cost
0/0
1/1
2/3
3/6
4/10
5/15
Prep is your ability to plan in advance. During setup, roll 7d10 and save rolls within your range. Spend one die to automatically pass an Improv test. Every rank above 0 increases your range by one, starting at 10 at rank 1.
Improv is your ability to perform under pressure. When you test Improv, roll d10s equal to your rank. The roll is successful if any die is 9 or greater. At rank 0, roll 2d10 and take the lowest.
Remaining points become Luck points, which you may spend to re-roll an Improv test with an additional d10. Luck replenishes after a heist.

Begin by discussing how your characters formed a crew and what heist they are about to attempt. Each player rolls Prep. For every 10, the players describe a helpful detail of the heist. For every 1, the GM describes an unhelpful detail.

# Has This Ever Happened To You?
```
Bust out the monopoly money.

Everyone makes up a company and vendor name, someone to be the face of their company and sell products. You'll be playing them alongside a helpless consumer.

Whoever comes up with their vendor first then plays the first consumer.

The consumer describes a problem they've encountered and are helpless to combat on their own. If you aren't sure what to say. Try "Has this ever happened to you?"

Everyone else gets a chance to pitch the consumer a product as their vendor, in the form of an informercial, that will help with the problem. The consumer can choose to change the channel if a pitch is going on for too long, moving on.

Once each vendor has made their pitch, the consumer splits up $100 among the vendors, how much they're willing to pay for the products. These are basically points. Consider each consumer to have each product they properly paid for though. The consumer then chooses the next consumer from players who haven't gone.

Once everyone's been a consumer, the current round ends. Play for as many rounds as you want but the money awarded doubles each round, and problems should be more dramatic.

# Exquisite: A Game About Clonefucking
```
For 1 or more players.

Divide a piece of paper into four quadrants. In the first box, put down "Player name:" and write your name. Label the other three boxes "Body," "Brain," and "Personality."

Write down facts about yourself in each of the categories that are true, and also good. Keep going until the sheet is full.

If you're playing with others, each of you should write down a fact, then pass the sheets in a round, helping the other players fill theirs out.

When the stats boxes are full, think about those facts as if they described an interesting stranger and decide: How old are they? Where are they from? What is their name? Write these details in the first box.

Think about the next three lines and narrate your response out loud. If you're playing with others, switch off between each line.
-Where do you take a date you're really excited by? What do they wear? What about you?
-It goes well. Of course it does-they are exquisite. What is your relationship like?
-One day they need to leave. You're sad, but it's time. What will you miss the most?
