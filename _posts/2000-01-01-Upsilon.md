# Mystery by Association
```
Setup:
Use 78 cards with pictures, ideally tarot cards. Setting is bayou noir.
Shuffle 22 Major Arcana and 56 Suit cards separately.
Shuffle two Arcana, three Suit together. Arrange face down: Top = Victim. Bottom = Murderer. Middle = Their Past. The Murder. Outcome.
Deal three Arcana to 3-6 Investigators to draft archetypes. Choose one, pass one left and one right, choose a second, discard remaining. 
Deal three Suit to everyone for starting hand. Numbered cards are skills or abilities, face cards are allies.

Investigation:
Reveal Victim.
Investigators each play a Suit (then redraw) to tell how they use that skill or ally to advance the case. Cards are "yes, and."
Reveal Their Past.
Investigators play to describe how they discover what happened or identify the Murderer. This round anyone may play all their Suits (and redraw) to reveal Murderer.
Reveal The Murder.
Investigators play to narrate how they track down or corner the killer. 
Reveal Outcome.
Investigators state how the case wrapped up for them. The Murderer may or may not be caught.

Growth:
After each case add or exchange one Arcana or +1 hand.
For long term play, each Investigator uses own deck.

When the 10th scene is over the game ends in a tragedy.

# A Hundred Years Adoring You
```
Gather a handful of friends. Maybe not best friends, but definitely friends. New friends are perfect.

You will all pretend to be less afraid than you actually are.
Find an empty room in a semi-public space, like a convention. Turn off the lights and make the room as dark as possible.

Walk around the dark room. When the spirit moves you, say something about one of your friends that you would not say to their face. The secrets you reveal should be complimentary to the recipient, but may make you uncomfortable or embarrassed.

Be specific, but do not address your friends by name.
The first secret should be whispered and barely audible. Each subsequent secret should be louder than the last, until everyone is shouting secrets into the darkness.

If you haven't spoken for about a minute, and you can't think of something sincerely nice to say, say something embarrassing about yourself instead. It's nicer to be nice. 

The game ends when someone not playing the game enters the room, or the lights are turned on.

Embrace the ambiguity. Ask no clarifying questions. Never talk about the game or the secrets revealed again

# Skeletal Dragon Organizes Their Ruin
```
For 2-4 Participants

(Participants bring miscellaneous objects they would be okay never seeing again. And notecards)

You are a single skeletal dragon, a mighty being's desecrated husk. The cost of the sorcery tying you to this existence is that your memories are tied solely to your possessions.

Place all items in a pile on a surface. This is your ruin and your ruin crumbles. Let out a mournful roar together. Raaaaawwoooo.

To confine your ruin, one participant at a time performs the following:

Pick up any object from the ruin and describe the independent memory of your beastly self this object contains. Decide to HOLD or DISPOSE the memory.

To HOLD, place the object on the surface away from the pile. Write a single word memory description on a notecard and set it with the object. If the object is placed next to another, collectively describe how those memories intersect and permanently alter the memories attached.

To DISPOSE, donate (later), discard, or safely destroy the object. The memory cannot be referenced again. Each participant must DISPOSE at least one object. The ruin crumbles.

Play until all objects have been organized.

Do not reclaim DISPOSED objects after the game.

# Up the Drunx
```
You are a bunch of drunk punx who are sick of this town's shit.  After a night of drinking, you are ready for a revolution.  Think globally, act locally, and overthrow your municipal government.

Materials: Glasses, one gross drink (preferably alcoholic like malort) per player, and one delicious drink per player (preferably alcoholic, like a pina colada).

GM: Your job is to put obstacles in the way of these young punx.  Don't make it easy for them to seize city hall and smash all the parking meters.

Mechanics: When you want to do something to overcome an obstacle, tell the GM.  The GM decides if it's small or big.  If it's small, take a swig of the yummy drink.  If it's big, take a drink of the gross one.  You always succeed with consequences.  You can down some gross drink to mitigate those consequences.

Play continues until someone doesn't feel well or the punx seize city hall.

Warning: Please drink responsibly.  Know your limits.  People are more important than games. GMs look out for your players.  If you or a loved one has a problem with alcohol, seek help.

# Reincarnation Station
```
The players are all reincarnations of the same person (except the Train Attendant) who return to the same train station between lives. They meet, they board the train, and they depart to be reborn. The order that the players have entered the room is the order the lives were lived. Each player decides what sort of incarnation they want to represent. 

One person is the Train Attendant, they make sure everyone is present, boards the train, and gets off at the appropriate stop. 

Meeting: While awaiting the train, everyone establishes key moments in their lives by reminiscing over their incarnation, this informs each other of the lives lived. 

Boarding: The incarnations will offer advice to each other as the train begins to leave, pulling from their own experiences to comment on those of their fellows. 

Departure: Each incarnation leaves, starting from the first incarnation and moving forward. When departing they share what they have learned, followed by stating a goal they have for their next life, influenced by the advice they've received.

      - WEAK (d6, life[1])
      -	AVERAGE (d10, life[2])
      -	TOUGH (d12, life[3])

Most humans are greedy, desperate, afraid. May be friend, foe, both. Most consider elves tales, and may well think you children.

# CQ
```
The Multiverse Transit Network is broken. Once everyone could travel
between universes. Some used technology, others magic. Now everyone is
stuck, but InterDimensional Messaging (IDM) still works.  

Make an IDM: record a video, post it to YouTube, and make a
G+ post. Make the video less than 4 minutes. Extra credit
for costumes, props, or VFX. Tag it #CQTheRPG on G+ so others can
find it and #CQReply.

Make long chains of videos!

When you make an initial #CQCall video you must address:
* Who you are.
* Where you're from.
* Where you're stuck?
* What difficulties you're having?

When you make a #CQReply you must address:
* Your identity
* Difficulties in your situation
* The outcome (see below) of the previous IDM. 
* Answer questions from the IDM and ask some new questions. 
* Explain an unlikely plan to help your interlocutor with their difficulties. Will it work?

Success / failure:
On upload your video gets a VideoID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcanVthL8A
Those numbers / letters at the end are the VideoID.  

Does the VideoID have doubled letters next to one another: aa or
-- but not aA. If it has doubles (odds: ~15%) your plan was
successful. On triples or better (~0.2%) it's amazing.

# Another Day in the Lab
```
-----Premise-----
3 players perform an experiment on an anomalous artefact. 
AUTHORITY plays the off-site bureaucrat, *and* narrates laboratory conditions.
PROCEDURE plays the on-site scientist conducting the experiment. 
SUBJECT, plays a clueless human assistant, *and* narrates the experimental results.

-----Setup-----
AUTHORITY gives PROCEDURE a vague prompt.
Example: "Good morning. Ready to begin testing the artefact found under the Arctic ice?"  

PROCEDURE expands on prompt to describe the artefact. 
Example: "We're ready. Artefact-297 is a small floating cube of obsidian." 

-----Gameplay loop-----
PROCEDURE decides what to do (may consult with others).
AUTHORITY may comment/protest, PROCEDURE may proceed/reconsider.
SUBJECT(s) narrates results (and controls any replacement assistants, if needed). 

-Example-

PROCEDURE: "Subject-451, please remove your insulated glove and touch the cube."

AUTHORITY: *nods* "Go Ahead."

SUBJECT: "Okay... %&@#! It burnt my hand!"

PROCEDURE: "Interesting... Let's take an x-ray."

AUTHORITY: "No; introducing radiation is too dangerous."

PROCEDURE: "Sorry, but it is worth the risk."

SUBJECT:  "Uh, it's starting to glow..."

-----Game end-----  
Game ends when AUTHORITY and/or PROCEDURE definitively declare as such.
If both agree to stop, AUTHORITY narrates.
PROCEDURE may simply cease working, then SUBJECT(s) narrates. 
AUTHORITY may call security/nukes/whatever to terminate the experiment, then PROCEDURE narrates.

# But why was the green coat left in your hall?
```
There is a fine line between listening and being talked at. 

You are telling a story with a moral. Decide which of you is the listener and which the teller. The listener begins by asking the teller a leading question about something they saw or heard. The teller answers for as long as they like. When they pause, the listener should ask another leading question. The listener should try to change the course of the story with their questions if they don't like the moral the teller seems to be headed for. 

The teller should try to make space for the listener to ask at least a few questions before they reach a moral. The teller should try to push for a moral they personally find wrong but be willing to choose a different moral as the story shifts. 

Both players should treat past statements and the assumptions inherent in questions as truth. 

Reverse roles and repeat if time allows.

# Bullshit Tour Guide
```
A game for 3+ people. One player at a time is the Guide. The rest are tourists.


Guide, hold your hand like you're speaking into a microphone. Try to make your voice sound like it's coming from a loudspeaker.

Begin the tour by pointing at something everyone can see and declaring a made-up "fact" about the subject. Invent fake names, places, historical events, etc., or twist real ones in unexpected directions. The more ridiculous and clearly false, the better:

"The Niagara Falls were constructed in 1994 as the first attraction of BuffaloLand, a new theme park."


Taking turns, each tourist asks a question about the topic, attempting to derail the Guide by introducing a new fact:

"Is it true that the water was replaced with maple syrup in celebration of the bicentennial?"


The Guide must confirm the tourist's question and add or change a detail:

"Yes, and it took nearly ten years to clean out the pumps afterward."


The tourists vote to determine if the Guide's response was satisfactory. If it wasn't, the tourist who asked the question becomes the new Guide, continuing the tour with a new interesting "fact":

"Approximately 47 gallons of water tumble down the falls daily...."

# Metahuman Correctional
```
You are the inmates and warden of a supervillain prison. Inmates want to discover the prison's dark secret and free themselves; the warden wants to demoralize the players.

Warden: come up with a secret; describe your character's attitude.

Inmates: give your character's power, and the reason she desperately needs to escape.

Place 7 tokens per player in a bowl for the inmates. Give the warden an empty bowl.

Take turns narrating scenes in which your character attempts something. Take 1-3 tokens from your bowl as bonuses, then roll 5+ on a d10 to succeed; narrate the result.
- Inmates: On a failure, tokens go to the warden's bowl; otherwise they go in an inmate success pile.
- Warden: Choose an inmate to demoralize. On failure, tokens go to the inmate success pile; otherwise, put them in your own success pile, and take one from the inmate bowl to put in front of the demoralized player. An inmate with 3 demoralization tokens changes sides, taking warden-style turns thereafter. 

On someone taking the last token, collaborate in a conclusion that favors the larger success pile; the warden includes demoralization tokens in her pile.

# Ships Passing
```
You are lovers reincarnating in a staggered pattern, immortal and alone, doomed to forever share only love and death. You don't remember why or how. There is no solution, nothing to fight, no way to understand why this has happened to you or where it stops.

Elder carries the memories of lives past and always dies when inevitable reunion causes Younger to fall in love again. Only in the moment immediately before death will Younger remember, becoming Elder and re-starting the cycle. 

Only one can talk at a time, centered on each other but forever out of sync.

Elder, describe -
- How long has it been?
- How have you changed?
- When do you decide to find them? Why now?
- What is your greatest fear about finding them?

Younger - 
- Who are you now?
- How do you meet?
- What makes you fall in love?
- How do they die?
- How was it your fault?
- What is the first memory that returns?

You can only converse directly when Elder is dying. Roll d6 after each exchange, once you roll a 1 the moment is lost. Younger is now Elder, and Elder is reborn.

There is no end, merely endurance. You will see your love again.
