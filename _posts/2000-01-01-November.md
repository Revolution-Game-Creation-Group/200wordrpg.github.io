# ZENTURURAK
```
We cannot sleep anymore. 
Rest, sure. 
But the dream world is forever locked beyond our reach.
Zentururak, the sorcerer, cursed all mankind with his last words.
We found relief consuming Aglaophotis, but soon there was none left.
Some speak of the sacred island of Daudi, where the eerie Vestals still grow the coveted seeds.
Are you desperate enough to gamble your soul?
The hunt begins.

CHOOSE A CLASS:

Godi - diplomacy, religion, trade

Hird - blades, survival, handicraft

Seidr - crows, herbs, spirits

You can add keywords when you are experienced enough.

TAKE 6d6 and split them in 2 pools.
One is your DAMAGE pool, the other is your SLEEP pool.

WHEN YOU ARE WOUND move 1 dice from SLEEP to DAMAGE.
WHEN YOU REST move 1 dice from DAMAGE to SLEEP.

WHEN A POOL REACHES 6 DICES you are dead, or become a nightmare.

PLAYERS roll all dice.
ROLL DICE when the outcome is uncertain. A 6 is a success.
ROLL YOUR DAMAGE POOL for physical feats.
ROLL YOUR SLEEP POOL for mental feats.
ADD AN EXTRA DICE for any keyword.
WHEN FIGHTING a 6 is 1 damage.

# Time-Phases
```
There's crack in the spacetime, therefore all players travel to one of six times periodically (approximately every 15 minutes). 

To define in which time they travel, one rolls a D6. Each number is assigned to one time. At the beginning they are at time 4. There should be a difference between the times of 20-40 Years.

If they change something in earlier times, it has impacts in the moment they travel back. They only travel thru time, not thru space, so if they enter a building, that isn't build then and go in the future, they are inside the building. Players never travel into solid matter.

Each player has six stats: agility, charisma, intelligence, prestidigitation, stealth, strength. At the beginning, each character could spend 7 points on them. 

To something that could fail, a player must roll a D6. He adds the value of the stat that fits must to the action. The higher, the better the action worked. It failed with a final result from 1-3 (higher with more difficult actions). 

The game is lead by a master who acts for the NPC and judges on the players actions. He also creates the story on his own.

# Dreamworld: Penny For Your Thoughts
```
...to sleep,

    perchance to dream...

Ay, there's the rub

    for in this sleep of death

            what dreams may come?
 - Hamlet



Distribute 8 points across Willpower, Imagination, Intelligence, and Dreaming.

Choose one Downside per skill (the greater the skill, the more dangerous its Downside):

Willpower invites Vice
  Imagination breeds Phobia
    Intelligence hides Secrets
      Dreaming shelters Irresponsibility

Calculate your Dreamworld abilities:

   Dexterity = Dreaming * Intelligence
   Strength = Dreaming * Willpower
[*]Legerdemain = Dreaming * Imagination
   Health = Intelligence * Willpower
   Perception = Intelligence * Imagination
   Charisma = Willpower * Imagination

[*] dream abilities: flying, breathing underwater, summoning objects...

To use an ability, flip a coin. Heads is +1, tails is -1. Flip until you get the other side: Heads, Heads, Tails is a +2; Tails, Heads is a -1. Add that to your ability, and compare it to either the difficulty of the situation (from failproof 0 to impossible 16), or by comparing your roll to the target's: racing Dexterity vs Dexterity, punching Strength vs Health, bluffing Charisma vs Perception.

As Dream Weaver, your job is to narrate the Dreamworld. Use Downsides against them to bring their nightmares to life - complete with running in slow motion.

A dream you dream alone is only a dream.
A dream you dream together is reality.

# Time Fragments
```
Setting
You are ethereal guardians of time. Someone went back in time to kill shogun Tokugawa. Take on temporary physical forms and stop him. Your time is limited.


Materials
three 2-minute hourglasses, stopwatch, tokens


Character creation
Describe a personalized archetype from the time of feudal Japan.


Mechanics
When conflict in the story arises, GM and player/s negotiate the outcome based on the abilities of the character/s until consensus is reached. 
Each player gets 14 (-1 per player) Time Fragments tokens. Every 15 minutes all players lose one token. When a player runs out of tokens, his character loses its physical form and is removed from this game. If an NPC witnesses it, the players lose. 

To save precious time, players can pay Time Fragments to activate special abilities:
- Time Freeze: freeze time for 5 minutes of in-game time per Fragment paid. The whole team can freely move while time is frozen.
- Time Rewind: take you and your team back in time up to 15 minutes of in-game time per Fragment paid.
- Glimpses of the Future: state a condition. The GM narrates what will be the outcome up to the next 15 minutes given the condition.

# TIGER-POET
```
China, seventh century. Player 1 plays SANGETSUKI, a failed poet who lost his mind. One night, sleepwalking, he entered the jungle and turned into a tiger. Take two different colored d20: One for his TIGER-side, the other for his POET-side.

Player 2 plays Five TRAVELLERS who enter the jungle looking for something. Take 2 apple-sized STONES.

Role-Play 5 scenes: 
In each of these, one TRAVELLER enters the jungle. Why? What is SANGETSUKI doing meanwhile? Both narrate. End scenes with their meeting and roll the dice. Re-roll doubles.

If TIGER-dice is the highest:
The TRAVELLER is killed. Otherwise escape by using a STONE, but the tiger will chase you in your nightmares: the TRAVELLER dips the stone in PAINT/INK and stamps it on paper. Add pen details to the print: eyes, fangs... Narrate your death or nightmare.

If POET-dice is the highest: 
SANGETSUKI asks the Traveler to write down one of his poems he remembers by heart: SANGETSUKI tears off one random page from an old book and covers all text with a black marker, skipping some evocative words to create a poem. 

After the last scene SANGETSUKI is free. The world will remember him through nightmares and poems.

# Can you hear me?
```
One player is the Ghost, the other is the Investigator.

Ghost: How do you know the Investigator? Choose a secret keyword or phrase to encapsulate your unfinished business.
Investigator: What draws you to this place?
Both: What kind of building houses this haunting?

Fill a small clear container with water. Collect several coins and some dark liquid, like ink. 

In each scene, the Investigator enters a room, declares the room type, and describes an interesting object in the room. The Ghost then attempts to communicate to the Investigator how this object is related to their death or unfinished business. Flip a coin into the container. If it's heads, the Ghost narrates successful and safe communication through either touch, an image, a smell, or a sound. On tails add a drop of ink into the container. The Ghost narrates how their attempt becomes twisted, smothering, or horrifying. The Ghost cannot communicate with the Investigator in any other way.

Conclude when either: the Investigator frees the Ghost by saying the secret keyword or phrase, or the coins in the container are no longer visible, leading to the Investigator's death. How do the Investigator and Ghost part ways?

# Power Dynamics
```
Sit down with a friend - across a table from each other. You need ten counters and a d10.

The two of you are in a relationship. Roll a d10 each. Whoever has the higher number has the power in the relationship. That person alone decides the nature of the relationship, and why they have the power. If you rolled the lower number, you cannot engage here.

The person with power begins with six counters, the person without begins with four.

The person without power describes a grievance. "You stay out too late," "you don't do the washing up," "your drinking is a problem."

Roll a d10 between you. If it is lower than the number of counters that the person in power has, they physically take a counter from the person without power. If it is higher, the person without power sets one of their tokens aside.

If you wish, you may role-play the argument, with the 'winner' of the argument being the one who moved the token.

When the person without power has no more tokens, roll a final time. If it is higher, they can narrate leaving, as dramatically and cathartically as they want; otherwise, they may not.

# Monkey News Ltd
```
One person plays the editor. It is approaching deadline and they need a story now! They come up with a headline like President wins war, or Bananas in short supply.

Other players are the monkeys, sitting at their typewriters and making up news. Each monkey has a quirk that drives them. Players make up what that is. It could be alcoholism, or conspiracy theories concerning bananas, or they want to be the next great American novelist...

Each player is assigned a paragraph of the story, paragraph 1, paragraph 2, etc. The players don't have time to share notes, and must write their paragraphs simultaneously. Of course, their quirk will determine the voice and focus of that paragraph.

Once this is done the players hand their paragraphs to another player, who edits, corrects, etc the other player's paragraph. Each player should edit all the other paragraphs. While this is happening the Editor will shout out more story information to be added to the story, and which monkey is to add it. They may also shout out encouragement or insults to the monkeys.

Once the paragraphs have been written and edited, the Editor collates and reads them aloud.

# Masters Of The Skies
```
Dragons have been apart of this world since the beginning of time. There are those who chose to stand with the world and those that would burn it. Glorgokk the Eternal is one of those who would see it burn. After the war of worlds between dragons and all other races, only a few choose to stand and fight.

Assemble your team of Elite Dragon Riders! Face Glorgokk and More! And become Master of the Skies!

You create your character, choose and create your mounts, and level up together. (Mounts are not restricted to Dragons) Mounts will always be double the level of their rider. Each mount will have a tier level maxing out at 5.

There will be 3 types of battles: aerial, accelerated, and traditional. Meaning there will be many encounters with colossal begings, armies, other dragon riders, etc. Also depending on the encounter you could end up using all 3 methods.

Accelerated combat is used when fighting large armies giving characters that god like feel one shotting most of them until you hit a mini boss.

Aerial combat: all riders will roll initiative, who ever is highest will lead the battle and everyone will act accordingly.

# The Noose
```
For one GM and multiple players.

The GM chooses a Horror and its goal. The group begins a game of Hangman, with the mystery word being the GM's Horror.

The Horror is trying to hunt and harm the characters. The characters investigate their surroundings to determine what the horror is, as it tries to complete its goals.

When the characters make progress on their investigation, they can guess a letter for their Hangman game. If correct, the letter is added to the board. If incorrect, a body part is drawn on the Hangman and the Horror gets closer to its goals or harming the characters.

Each player can make one guess as to what the Horror is (and the mystery word). If they successfully guess, the Horror manifests and they narrate the characters' escape or triumph.

If they run out of guesses, the Horror manifests and the characters are caught, killed, or consumed by it, and their story ends.

# Revolutionary Committee
```
Article I: Principles

1. The players are the rightful voices of the people. They have no game master; it is their duty alone to rise up against the weak king and his corrupt ministers.

2. United, the players will decide on the list of ideals they will fight for.

3. Every player has an absolute right to choose two of those ideals for their character to advocate for, and one they will oppose.

4. The characters are each the leader or paragon of a faction or class in the realm.

5. That faction will be played by the player sitting across from them.

Article II: Administration

1. Each player in turn will narrate their character's revolutionary struggle. All other characters and factions may participate as needed. 

2. The player controlling the current character's faction has special duty to speak for the faction's interests; to take to the streets to support their leader - or to stop their betrayal.

3. When conflict arises between characters or factions, the matter will be resolved with a majority vote among the players.

Article III: State of Emergency

1. A player may overrule a vote.
2. Doing so requires sacrificing one of their ideals forever.

BRIEFING

Read aloud:
"You are part of a vast international conspiracy of the utmost importance. Your mission-should you decide to accept it-is to pick a target and help them have a better day. Your methods should be subtle and not draw attention to you or your mission.  Anonymously buy them a cup of coffee, thank them for something good you've seen them do, share a photo of a cute animal or listen to their story. Then disappear back into the crowd. Always disappear back into the crowd. Reassure them that there is good in the world, that others can be kind, and that sometimes good things just happen.

Go forth into this dark world as a beacon of light."

ADVANCEMENT

Start at Level 1 and advance until you struggle. Then thank yourself for your good work, and start back at Level 1. With practice and perseverance you will advance quickly.

# The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath
```
You've been dreaming of a golden city for several nights. You tried hard to reach its mysterious glowing towers, but every time you woke up. Tonight, you decided to go to Kadath, where lies the Dream Gods, for them to bring you to the city. Just, wait... What is Kadath, exactly ?

During that night, your friends assume the role of the nefastuous Dream Gods. They only want you to fail : one cannot defy their authority ! 

You have ten tokens to assign. They can be Lucidity, its your implication in the Dream. When you run out of them, you wake up and the game is over. Try another night ! Tokens can also be Imagination. They allow you to influence what happens in the Dream.

Only Dream Gods can decide what you encounters during your journey to Kadath. If there is danger, roll a dice. Even, you're safe. Odd, you lose some Lucidity. You can decide to lose one Imagination and automatically succeed. Each token spent makes the Gods angry : the Dream becomes Nightmare. 

You might encounter friend like Cats of Ulthar but be very careful of the enigmatic Dholes, who can take any form and substance to devour your unfortunate soul.

# Draw me a kingdom
```
Players are old adventurers sitting around a fire who remember the history of their kingdom. Each in turn must bring an additional element to the story and draw it on the map.

The first player draws the kingdom in the center of the map and divides the rest into blank areas (1 per player).

Age of Balance
**************
Each player determines the content of one of the blank areas (geography, population and relations with the central kingdom) by rolling a D6 (1-2: good for the kingdom, 3-4: neutral for the kingdom, 5-6: bad for the kingdom). The player justifies his story by drawing a geographical element on the map.
Once everyone has played, the players debate by show of hands about the physiognomy of the kingdom (economy, politics, life...). In case of a tie, roll the dice to break the tie. 

Age of Crisis
*************
A player tells the big event that turned the kingdom into a crisis. 
If the first player chooses to tell a positive event, the second must follow on from the negative consequences of the previous event and so on, alternating positive and negative.


At the end, the players debate the fate of the kingdom.

# We Can Once More Ascend
```
"We are descended from Gods. When need arises, we can once more ascend," your grandmother whispered in your ear, pressing the bow into your hands.

You need: GM, player, polyhedral dice.

Player: You are from an isolated village. The storm is coming. It travels swiftly, an arrow of chaos. Someone must stop it. You.

Describe:

Your village and why you love it
You, a normal villager
Your fear

GM: Describe the scenes and create threats. Escalate with each scene. Take inspiration from the scene list, village, and their fear. When the player succeeds, move to the next scene.

- A Bear
- The Crossing
- Climbing to the sky
- The Storm

Start with two d6. One represents your fear, the other your self. When you take action in the face of danger, roll your self die and fear die. 
- When fear is higher, fail. Create an additional fear. One fear manifests -- attempt to overcome it. If you fail, move self down one step. Either way, move forward with the scene.
- When self is higher, succeed, and ascend. With each ascension, describe how you become closer to embodying lightning, and increase self one step. 

Steps:
D6: Mundane
D8: Hero
D10: Demigod
D12: Lightning
```
<hr>

# ENVOY
```
ENVOY is a game about persuasion, cultural perceptions, and getting what you want. 

You will need:
- 3+ players
- tokens (coins, marbles)

One player is the Envoy, a human sent to understand an alien world. 

The others are representatives of the alien culture. Each should have different ideas: representatives have agendas. Take three tokens and decide on yours.

On the Envoy's turn: recount what you know about the alien culture. Then, ask one question. All other players may bid favor tokens; whoever bids highest answers.

On a representative's turn, choose one:
- Give the Envoy a gift. Describe it, and what it cost you. Take one favor token.
- Show the Envoy around. Tell them one detail about the world. Pay one favor token.
- Bribe another player. Give them two favor tokens and tell them one detail about the world you want them to agree upon.
- Undermine another player. Describe how you discredit them and trade favor tokens.
- Contradict something. Pay all of your favor tokens (3+) to change one thing the Envoy knows.

After ten rounds, the Envoy returns to Earth to disseminate their understanding of this culture. Human perceptions are hard to change; whatever understanding prevails is set in stone.

   What haven't you taught her? (Your advantage)

Everyone starts with 2 black and 2 white tokens (hidden), a blank page and pencil. A bag contains six more tokens of each colour.

Everyone secretly contributes one of their four tokens to the situation's narrator, one more is drawn from the bag.

Narrator reveals the contributions.
   <1/3 white: Full Failure
   <1/3 black: Full Success
   Otherwise both apply
Narrator describes what happens. 

Tokens returned to bag, everyone replenishes their spent token by drawing a random token from the bag.

   Success: She gains an advantage
   Failure: Someone loses an advantage

# HAIL SATAN!
```
You are all in a demonic cult!
Problem: You are not all in a demonic cult.
Cultists: You must sacrifice the outlier!
Non-Cultists: Don't get sacrificed.

Before the game, each player blindly takes a slip of paper with
one the following roles of either "Cultist" or "Non-Cultist". 

Choose a player to start the round and say a prayer about the dark lord.
All players must close their eyes. 

At the end of the prayer, the speaking player must announce, "PRAISE BE!".
In response, all Cultists will respond in unison, "HAIL SATAN!". 
If you are a Non-Cultist, You CANNOT ever say "HAIL SATAN!" but you can say something similar or sounds like it. Try to blend in.

After the prayer, all players open their eyes.
Accusations may be made followed by a new round.

After all players have a turn to speak, everyone nominates the player who made the best prayer for the dark lord as "Cult Leader". Cult Leader now makes the decision on who to sacrifice.

If you are a non-cultist and get chosen for cult leader, you lose as you got in too deep. This player still gets to choose who to sacrifice if there are remaining Non-Cultists.

# The Master's Gambit
```
The Master reads this to themselves, hidden from the Apprentice.

Years ago, your master betrayed you. Find Apprentice to use in enacting vengeance.
- List preparatory missions.
- What if you are discovered by your target?
- How will you get Apprentice on your side? Ask: Living situation, aspirations, foe/rival?

Master has 4 dice in the Forms: Circle/Triangle/Rectangle. Apprentice has 0. Your target will have 6.

Name a Form to describe actions. "I CIRCLE around them," "I make a TRIANGULAR three-pronged attack," "I open the SQUARE chest."
- Master declares difficulty (1 - 5).
- Actor rolls Form's dice (d6), Master rolls extra dice for advantage.
- Narrate success per die > difficulty.
- New understanding demonstrated, # Dice < 6: Master may award die.

Before a mission, train through example. Once ready, light the Cambra Root to control Apprentice. Lead to next objective. Frame as safely honing skills through "vision quest."
- Snap fingers to awaken, send on mission. Help when necessary, then disappear.
- Mission accomplished, snap fingers to put them under. Take them home to sleep.
- Explain away any signs their "vision" was real.

Accompany Apprentice on final mission. As you take revenge, Apprentice realises what you've done. Fight, die, or escape and the cycle repeats.

# Meeting of Fictional Gods
```
The fictional gods have a meeting every week, often in a casino or the center of some terribly old star. Once there, they discuss the particulars of their existence, defining and redefining themselves by playing a game with mortal lives. 

A game for 3- 5 players:

Create a scene by marking a large square on a table. 
Place two stones inside the scene, and three outside.

Players decide what the distance between stones represents.
Perhaps distance represents distance. Perhaps distance represents love.

On a player's turn, they attempt to describe the current scene. 
This player then changes the scene in accordance to the god they've chosen to embody. 

God of Self: In 1 - 2 words, define what 1 stone represents. (Shoemaker, New-York Hope)
God of Others: In 1 - 2 words, define a relationship between 2 stones. (Parents, Strangers, Enemies, Friends) 
God of Chance: Switch the position of 2 stones.
God of Decision: Move a stone anywhere in the scene.
God of Chaos: Redefine what distance between stones represents.

Once a cycle of turns has ended, place a new stone onto the board.
After 3 cycles, take turns removing stones, explaining each one's ultimate fate.

# Bad Bishop
```
This game needs two players, knowledge of basic chess rules, and a historic chess game. Go online and find one. It doesn't matter which but it helps to not know the outcome.

You will be telling the story of two warring families. Discuss the setting. Medieval Europe? Fantasy? Western? Space opera? Stretch the definition of "family". Don't add too much detail.

Open the chess game and fast-forward 15 moves. What does the board look like? Think of characters that represent each piece. Who is missing? Who is powerful? Who is in danger? Flesh out the story up until now.

Each player chooses a side to control. Black or White. You are not competing.

Play out the remainder of the game using the historic record. One move at a time. 

For each move, what has changed in the story? What is that character doing? Who is opposed? Is a grand sacrifice in the works? The controlling player narrates what that means in the fiction, as descriptively as she likes. The other player adds details. Collaborate.

Go back and forth until the chess game ends. Who won? Was it a draw? What does that mean for the fiction?

Together create an epilogue.

# These are animals
```
One player, one GM.

Player: you are seven. You were with your mother, travelling to a new place, but suddenly there were men in uniform, shouting, and she screamed and they took her away. You don't know why. You don't know where she is. 

Now you are in a car. You don't know where you're going. There is one other person in the car. (This is the GM.) You have never seen them before. They do not speak your language.

Player: put a die in a cup and turn the cup upside down. This is your situation. The higher the number, the worse it is. You don't know what it is because you can't see the die.

GM: look at the die. Behave accordingly, or not. You're just driving the player somewhere. But you must prevent the player from seeing the number on the die. 

The game ends if the player sees the die or if the GM touches the player. The GM now reveals the number and describes what happens at the end of the journey. 

The player is reunited with their mother if the GM lifts the cup and the die has disappeared.

Replay 1475 times.

- Who are you?
- What year is it?
- Where are we?
- Create a fictional item. How was it made? Why was it created? What does it do?
- Roughly sketch your item on a sheet of paper.
- Pass the item to the next player.

HOLDER TURN:
- Who are you?
- What year is it now?
- How has the world changed?
- How did the item come into your possession? What do you do with it? How does it make you feel?
- If you are not the last HOLDER, pass the item to the next HOLDER.
OR
- If you are the last HOLDER, tear up the sketch.
- What happened to the item?
- How did its legacy end with you?

# Evolution
```
How will your species evolve and become extinct?

In the beginning . . . work together to create an intelligent species at the top of the food chain and choose a player to go first.

On your turn, describe how the species evolves, then roll a d6. An odd number results in an Odd Mutation. Describe what the Odd Mutation is and how it developed. If you roll a 1, an Extinction Level Event occurs. Describe the event and how the species goes extinct.

After an Extinction Level Event, the next player is responsible for creating a new species. Play then continues as before. If that player has already been responsible for creating a new species, the task passes to the next player in line until all players have created a new species.

Once each player has created a new species following an Extinction Level Event, the next one is the total destruction of the world. Work together to describe how it happens.
