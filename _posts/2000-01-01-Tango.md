# Outbackia
```
Players are an indigenous clan of hunter gatherers represented by aspects of nature. Each player selects a unique Aspect and collectively rolls a d8 to overcome threats, drawing strength from their Clan Song, a d6 counter that starts at 3. 

Each round Globalization threatens the clan with a d12 roll. Threats can include: Building a railway through sacred land, converting clan members to monotheism, hunting animals to extinction. 

Players narrate how their Aspects defend against Globalization. Each narration adds +1 to the d8 roll, up to the total of the Clan Song. The d8 roll and total narrative bonus must match or be higher than the Globalization d12 roll to defend against the threat. Narratives must be unique and new each round. 

Success increases Clan Song by one. Rotate d6 counter up one to match. Players now have one extra narrative to modify d8 rolls.  

Failure reduces Clan Song by one. Rotate d6 counter down one to match. Players now have one less narrative to modify d8 rolls. 

Players must advance Clan Song to 6 then gain a final success to survive Globalization. If Clan Song drops below 1 the clan has been exterminated.   

Survival is meant to be difficult.

# The Old Timers Are Liars
```
Players are old timers and they're sitting around a game of dominos or bridge or so, just before siesta, and they are noisily trading half truths, misremembered memories, ghost stories, and visions of saints. Their stories are magical but lies the same.

Old timers take turns rolling 5d6, aiming for a straight of at least three dice - 1,2,3 or 3,4,5 etcetera etcetera. If they get a straight, this is the lie, the old timer must describe some nonsense from their younger days. A duel in the street, love affairs with mermaids, a visit to a strange land.

Time lost at sea.

A game of chess with a ghost.

Something only a child would believe if she believes in any magic at all.

Each old timer takes a turn at rolling to tell a lie in order from youngest to oldest. A round passes when each old timer has rolled.

Any old timer who cannot roll a straight does not have a good lie to tell. If they spend two rounds unable to top the lies of their neighbors they shuffle off to nap away the humidity - they are out of the game.

# The Caper
```
What you need:
- A deck of cards
- Friends

You are group of ne'er do wells who are planning crime and must unravel how and why it went down as you tell it. This is done by taking turns telling the story and by challenging the current storyteller when they say something you don't agree with.

Each player draws 5 cards from the deck when the game starts. When one player challenges another, both play 1 or more card face down from their hand. Reveal all facedown cards at once. The player with the highest total value becomes the new storyteller. All revealed cards are discarded. Each participating player draws 1 new card. Cards have Blackjack values. 

The active player may also challenge the top X cards of the deck during an important. Players get 1 loot for winning a challenge and one more for each card beyond the second in a deck challenge.

The heist is over when the deck is empty. The player with the most loot then has a chance to run with the treasure. Players may challenge the leader with what's left of their hands or give the leader their cards in exchange for a share.

# Intents
```
Characters act based on intents.

Suggestions for intents: Attack, Defend, Protect, Distract, Deceive, Avoid, Support, Assist, Convince, Understand, Predict, Alter Scene, Craft.

All players must agree on a common list of intents.

Characters start with all intents at 0. They can increase any by decreasing another (minimum initial score: -1, maximum: +2).

An action is described by "I want to [Intent], so I [Action description]". If GM approves of the combination, roll 2d6. 

[Result score] = ([number of 5s & 6s] - [number of 1s & 2s]) + [intent score]

An action is successful if the Result matches or beats its difficulty (medium =1, challenging =2, monstrous=3)

A session is split into story sections (which may include as many actions as needed), and discreet challenges.

A challenge is a sequence of actions, accumulating a sum of the Result scores, to match or beat a challenge score, normally around [difficulty * complexity * #characters]. Complexity is the number of rounds in the challenge.

In every round, each character must have a turn (sequence of play determined by a 2d6 roll), but cannot repeat an intent used by the previous character, or the last intent used by the same character.

# R&J   : D  /  : (
```
R&J is a two-person, multi-day RPG based on Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, which takes place over the course of five kind of imbecilic days in which R&J meet, elope, and needlessly poison themselves to death.    

Day 1: Ask a random stranger you have a crush feeling about to play R&J with you.  Co-author a sonnet to test compatibility. Good? Trade phone #s and arrange tomorrow's wedding vows: a silly or serious investment outside of everyday routines that is personal to the players; ie "we both freaking love Ke$ha. We will freaking dress and speak like Ke$ha all day."

Day 2: Enact vows. Regularly text your partner updates. 

Day 3: Create a public declaration of love in support of your partner, who's been banished from town for killing your cousin.  Text them photos.  

Day 4: You're temporarily poisoned. Don't contact your partner for 24 hours.  Give up something else you love for 24 hours, too; you are comatose.  

Day 5: Your partner thought you *actually* died and poisoned themselves for real. Write their obituary and text it out in tribute to your love.  

Epilogue: All love stories come to an end. Delete your partner's contact info.

# Peril
```
PERIL:
3 players. Each needs 3 coins.

Each player chooses to play as embodiment of one of three ethereal forces: Hate, Sadness, or Love.
Peering upon earthly peril from afar (ex: war, famine, fascist uprising, social dissolution, the end of days).

The player to your left is your friend, the player to your right is your enemy.

On a turn, the player proposes a utilitarian solution (best for the most people) to the peril relevant to their force, to which each other player must ask one question that must be resolved.

Once each player has proposed their solution, vote. Heads = yes, tails = no. Place one of your coins in front of each player, conceal your votes somehow, then reveal all votes simultaneously. 

The solution with most Heads votes wins. If any solutions are tied for most, a consensus cannot be reached and no solution is chosen. The players lose and Peril wins.

Pick a number from 2-5:
- Low = techie
- High = talker

Introduce yourself.

Roll 1d6 for DIFFICULTY.

Active player introduces COMPICATION.
Write down COMPICATION and DIFFICULTY.

In turn order, players say how they assist and roll 1d6:

- TALK COMPICATION -> roll lower than your number

Continue until SUCESSES = DIFFICULTY

Failed rolls add to the STACK. 

If the STACK falls, the jig's up.
The player who knocked the STACK is caught. Explain how.
Other players grab as many d6s from the STACK as they can and GET OUT.

Overcome six complications and you get the ITEM.
Evenly divide the dice from the STACK. Then GET OUT.


GET OUT:
Working back through complications, players roll their dice.
Dice less than DIFFICULTY are lost.

Players with dice continue.
Players with no dice are caught. Explain how.

Players with dice remaining after final complication escape.
Explain how and their life afterwards.

# LARPodcast: A LARP About Podcasts
```
A LARP / improv game for a crowd of 6+ people.  In each game, groups of players, playing fictional versions of themselves, conceptualize a podcast together. They then perform a sample episode in front of the other participants, who vote for their favorites by "Following" them.

--SEQUENCE OF EVENTS--

-Groups of 2 or 3 are decided randomly. Each group should have the same number of Hosts, unless the size of the crowd is not divisible by 2 or 3.

-Each group spends 10 minutes creating their podcast together. They decide the high concept (potentially based on mutual passions and interests), the title, and the topic of the episode.

-The episode is Episode 10 of everyone's podcast. Each group should act as if their podcast already has an established format, tagline, and/or intro/outro phrases.

-Each group takes turns improvising their 3-5 minute long abridged episode, with the rest of the crowd as their audience.

-After each group performs, each player writes down which podcasts they would "Follow". Every player must vote for a minimum of two podcasts (or one, if there are only three groups) and cannot vote for their own podcast. The podcast with the most Follows wins!

# Sandcastle in a Dream
```
Roles: 
 * old man
 * environment and weather
 * memories of the past
 * one who collects the soul

An old man is building a sandcastle in his dreams, his last sandcastle on this mortal coil, humming a song of the past while he does so.  

[__Describe the setting.]  

A being enters the dream to change the song and affect the environment.  

[__The only interaction from this being will be to describe the song, environment, and weather for all characters.]

While the old man talks at the being (maybe), memories of the past will approach him.  

[__This player will be many people from the old man's past to expose him.  These memories revolve around three troubling events from the old man's past.]

Memories, are you there to help or condemn? Be wary of the environment, it may expose you.

[__When the three events are named, the collector should enter the dream to help clear the memories and the environment until just the sandcastle and the old man and the collector remain.  Talk about the most troubling of the three events.]  

Old man, do you go quietly with the collector?  Collector, what do you do with the sandcastle?

# The Rap RPG for You and Me
```
Keep away from Diamond City. It ain't exactly pretty.

Words aren't spoken here. They're strung together like a song. Rapping heard far and near. And you'll be rapping right along.

'Cause we police the streets with beats. And serve justice out with style. Resolve our conflict through rap. No bloodshed, just bile.

Turf wars fought with words. Robberies with flow. Crimes of fashion everywhere. Having money's the way to go.

You'll have your own Style, Rep, and Wealth. Roll 1d6 to make them yourself.

When in danger add 1d4. If your rap is successful, then danger no more.

These two rolls total are the lines you must rap. The strength of which? The MC determines that.

The threatened aspect is the one you must use. With multiple involved, you're forced to choose.

Against the MC, they're the one you attack. But they've got foes who can counter back.

Between the two rhymes, the strongest wins. Life goes on 'till a new fight begins.

Rumor has it that our words grow strong. Folks dropping out after not too long.

Who knew words could have so much sway? It seems like they have more every day.

# Golden Years
```
Materials:
An opaque bag
5 each solid colored, cat's eye, and swirl marbles
1 shooter marble
A circle of chalk

Characters are elderly residents in a small town retirement home watching the New Year's Eve countdown and reminiscing. Name each character and develop a bare bones background--family, profession, personality quirks, etc., but don't expand upon these basics.

Players draw marbles from the bag to create memories based on the type of marble drawn. Solid colored marbles are character defining moments. Cat's eye marbles are bittersweet memories. Swirl marbles are joyful memories. Players may roleplay memories, particularly if other players' characters are involved, or may describe them. Place drawn marbles in the center of the chalk circle until the bag is empty.

Players close their eyes and aim the shooter toward the marbles in the circle three times. Any marble that leaves the circle is now a memory lost based on marble type. If a character no longer has that type of memory to lose, they will begin to forget family members, profession, location, etc.

A final New Year's Eve should occur afterward, where characters attempt to reminisce, but some memories come more readily, while others seem lost to time.

# Minutes to Midnight
```
You awake to the sound of a scream. Was it your own? It's dark, but slowly your eyes adjust. You and your friends are in a dark basement. A thick wooden door lies before you. You find a rusty key. You'll need their help. Work together to escape before the clock strikes midnight. 

One person is the DM. Get a deck of playing cards and take out one joker. Shuffle it into the top X cards where X is the number of players. Deal each player 3 cards. Players holding jokers are corrupted.

DM picks a player to face each obstacle.
 
At each obstacle:
-	Everyone draws one card (Time ticks on)
-	Player announces method to tackle obstacle
- 	DM announces difficulty
-	Player selected asks for help (But who can you trust?)
-	Player and helpers discard any number of cards (Jokers can't be discarded)
-	Add the value of all cards discarded vs difficulty (Face cards = 10)
     o	     Success: Player and Helpers draw a card
     o	     Failure: Discard cards from deck by amount of loss
-	Helpers exchange one random card with player (Corruption spreads)

If the deck runs out, the clock strikes midnight and all players lose. Only non-corrupted players who escape win.

# With a Smile on Their Face
```
 
You arrive to the party, but you know something is off. Everyone is friendly, but some are a bit too friendly

As players arrive, each is given a card, assigning them a role. Only the Aliens know their allies. 

There are 2 teams that players are divided into;
Aliens:		Mankind:
1 Queen		1 Immune
2 Drones	Civilians
		        1 Host

The goal for Aliens is to convince the civilians they are the Immune, and create new Drones.

The goal of Mankind is to discover the Queen, and have the Immune eliminate them.

The Immune has only one chance to correctly identify and kill the Queen.  

Among the Civilians, there is the Host. The Queen alone needs to convert the Host, they are the only way to kill the Immune.

For players to complete an action, they must shake hands. The Immune makes Civilians immune from Drones. Civilians that shake with an Alien become a Drone themselves. The Queen shaking hands with the Immune kills the Queen. Drone-Host shaking hands with the Immune kills the Immune.

For Mankind to win, the Queen must die. 

They aren't your friends anymore. They will betray you, with a smile on their face.

# Childish Things
```
What you'll need 
-A storyteller
-Some players
-Some mementos(toys, personal items, things from the past)
-A coin

The storyteller is the General. The players are Soldiers. 
The Soldiers are at war, far away from home, the only remaining members of their squad.  
The General has a Mission for the Soldiers to complete. 
The General begins by telling each Soldier their role in the squad. Each Soldier responds by describing what their eyes look like, and placing three mementos in front of them. 
The Soldiers then commence the Mission.
A Soldier will always succeed when taking a militaristic action. If a Soldier attempts any other action, flip a coin; heads, they succeed; tails, they encounter a complication. 
When a Soldier does something no one should have to do, they choose a memento, tell the others what it means to them, or a memory associated with it, and puts it away, removing it from the game.
While a Soldier has no mementos, the General controls their actions.
When you share a tender moment with another Soldier, you may give them one of your mementos. Tell them what it means to you. 
The game ends when the Mission is accomplished.

# Dust, Hope & Wind
```
Each of y'all play a farmer or immediate family member. Describe yourself and your life.

Say what will dry up and blow away without the rain. If it is trivial, get 1d6. If it is your farm, marriage or life, get d20. Other dice (d8, d10 or d12) can be assigned by the group as they deem fit.

Say how you handle the drought and collect dice for it. Hock the house for crop insurance? d10. Pray for rain? d8. Give up on your rose garden? d6. Lobby your Congresscritter? d12. More effort means bigger dice.

Thunderheads build in the east, and a cool wind backs around to catch them. Where are you when the sky gets dark, and what are you doing? Get dice from the group if you're outside doing something important or you're at risk of getting caught in a bad way.

Everyone roll your dice and total them all. Add 3 to the total for every week since it last rained.  This is your Impact Score. Write it down.

Roll d6.

Compare it to your Impact score. Then tear it up.

On a 6 it rains.

# How Legends Are Made
```
Materials: 
Even Number of Players
Paper
Pens
60 Second Timer



Players sit in a circle and work together to invent a Crisis. Create a Setting and a Threat to that setting. Examples: The kingdom and the Dragon-Emperor, Central High-school and the East-side Snakes, Gastown and the hurricane. 
Talk only in broad strokes, not spending more than 5 minutes.

Each player invents a Hero. In one or two sentences, they introduce their Hero to the group.

Then, divide the players into two groups, A and B, by counting off around the circle.

In 60 second turns, A players whisper what happened to their Hero during the Crisis to the B player to their Left. B players may not talk, ask questions, or write anything down. 

B players now turn to their Left, and whisper everything that happened during the Crisis to their Hero and the Hero whose tale they just heard. They must reconcile any apparently conflicting facts. 

This continues until all Heroes' tales have made their ways around the circle. At this time, without speaking, each player writes down the events of the Crisis and what occurred with each Hero. Stories are then shared.

This is How Legends are Made.

# Dreaming Atlas
```
It is 440 AD in North Africa. You have come to the Atlas mountain to retrieve a dream. It was important to you. But Atlas does not release dreams easily. 

Pick a Character: a Berber noble, a Roman official, a Vandal warrior, an Egyptian anchorite, an Alan soldier, an Ethiopian merchant. 

Now your Characters eat the Lotus and enter the Dream Realm.

Randomly choose a Character to start. The player to their left creates a sentence of no more than 4 words. Flip a coin. Heads earns the Character a Dream Token, Tails gives them a Nightmare Token. Using the created sentence the Character describes the emerging dream or nightmare and it's importance. Write this down. The Character to their right goes next.

After everyone has earned a token Characters may trade back their Dream Token to remove another Character's Nightmare Token. The players trading tokens describe how their Characters work together to overcome the nightmare but lose the dream fragment. Cross these out.

When you hold 3 Dream Tokens, the beginning, middle, and end of your dream you may awaken and remember it. If you are holding 3 Nightmare Tokens, immediately, you are trapped by Atlas in eternal sleep.

<hr>

# The Cataclysm
```
3-6 players.  A shuffled Tarot deck.

One player is the CATACLYSM.  They describe the setting and a sense of the potential cataclysm, large or small.

The other players are LUMINARIES seeking to avoid calamity.  Each describes their character.

Deal ten cards to the CATACLYSM in a stack.  Deal ten cards to each LUMINARY'S hand.

Each LUMINARY plays a card from their hand and describes a plan to prevent the cataclysm.

Cups - Environmental
Pentacles - Technological
Swords - Social
Wands - Spiritual, ethical

Major Arcana are wild and can describe any plan.

The CATACLYSM plays the top card in their stack.

Page = 11, Knight = 12, Queen = 13, King = 14.

The LUMINARIES temporarily succeed if:
1.  They played a card of the same suit AND a higher rank than the CATACLYSM, or
2.  They played a Major Arcana of higher rank.

If the CATACLYSM played a Major Arcana, so must have the LUMINARIES to succeed.

Discard all cards played.  If the LUMINARIES succeed, the CATACLYSM discards their next card.  Otherwise, all LUMINARIES discard one card from their hands.  The CATACLYSM narrates the continuing cataclysm.

If all players have cards, a new round begins.  

The loser has no cards remaining.  The victor narrates the end.

# Rhea
```
Cast (4+):
* CRONUS. Tyrant, patriarch, infanticidal.
* RHEA. Mother, protector.
* Others: Children, one destined to rule.

52-card deck:
* Cronus' hand: Three cards per child.
* Children's hand: Starts empty.
* Rhea: Take four cards per child including two jokers, shuffle, distribute evenly to children - their personal decks. Keep nothing.

Black cards: Divine power.
Red cards: Rhea's love (useless to Cronus).

Turn Structure:
* Nourishment. Children draw once from their personal decks to hand.
* Attention. Rhea examines one non-devoured child's hand.
* Roleplay. Scheme, plead, love. Children play children's games, hint at jokers, plan when to discard. Rhea coordinates. Cronus overhears, making threats aloud and plans in secret.
* Devouring. Cronus may choose a child and discard a black card - they discard an equal/higher red card, or are devoured.
* Retaliation. Clockwise from Cronus, choose: discard a joker or pass.
*** Red Joker: Mother's Revenge. Devoured children are freed.
*** Black Joker: Titanomachy. Each non-devoured child discards a black card; total them. Cronus discards all his black cards. Face cards are 11. Highest total wins.

Devoured children cannot roleplay or discard black cards.

After Titanomachy/four turns...
* Cronus wins Titanomachy/child with Black Joker devoured: Cronus passes judgement.
* Cronus loses Titanomachy: survivors pass judgement.
* Another result: negotiate settlement.

# FOMO: The Game
```
Best played with a group of strangers meeting for the first time.

FOMO stands for "fear of missing out."  FOMO: The Game is about the anxieties and insecurities proffered by social media.

To play: each player needs a cell phone and an Instagram account.

Designate one player as the "Homebody."  They will briefly describe a reason why they couldn't make it out last night and then give the rest of the players a brief prompt in the following format:

"I hope I didn't miss _____________."

All other players have 1 minute to search Instagram for an image related to that prompt (interpreted as widely or narrowly as they wish).  They will then use the image to tell a story to the Homebody about the epic experience they missed.  

The Homebody awards a point to the player whose story inspires the most FOMO.  That player gets a bonus point if their photo came from their own personal Instagram account.

Play continues with every player rotating into the role of the Homebody at least twice.  

The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.  Everyone else must now follow their account for at least one month.

# Masters of the Lair
```
MASTERS OF THE LAIR

You need one d6 die, pencils, index cards, readiness to do evil.

You inhibit a dungeon of some kind. Each player (2-6 players) creates a creature of evil.

Each player discreetly writes down something about the Lair on an index card. It may be dangerous or weird. You reveal cards and put them together, creating a common evil place. Your lair. From here you will spread your evil.

Let your reign of mischief begin: One of the players, anyone, the fastest or the boldest, maybe, takes action and declares the next Evil Undertaking. Undertakings could be: steal something from another lairmaster, build a suicidal and ingenious trap, tame a monster, hoard treasures, venture into the Goodlands and bring evil, explore new parts of the lair, defend your lair.

Other players roll dice: player with lowest roll creates misery and problems for the undertaking. The player with the highest roll facilitates the story, fills the gaps and gamemasters the current undertaking. All players go on their undertaking together. Conflicts of any kind are resolved by d6 rolls (1: catastrophe, 2-3: success at cost, 4-5: success, 6: success drawing attention).

After that, the next undertaking.

# Have You Heard This One Before?
```
For 3 - 8 Players

You're a group of young children sitting around a campfire, as the night darkens it's time to tell your favourite spooky stories. Whomever volunteers to go first will start off. 

Once the story has started and the initial premise is described: place, time, people involved, type of horror alluded to, anyone has the ability to interrupt telling the storyteller "That's not how this one goes!" and must follow up with their edited details of how the story should go. The remaining listeners will decide whose story sounds the most interesting to continue, in the event of a tie vote settle it with a round of rock/paper/scissors. Winner continues on with their version of the story.

Continue the story with as many interjections and fights for control until it reaches a natural conclusion, upon which whomever ends the story is considered the winner. They now are the most knowledgeable of scary stuff and the most grown up. The winner decides the type of story to be told next and who tells it.

The game repeats and continues with competitively telling stories until you are out of stories, the youngest gets tired, or someone's mom calls.

# What's my Motivation?
```
The games we play are merely Hollywood productions, and we the actors who star in them.
Each Player takes the role of the actor playing the parts of their various characters.
The Game Master of any given game is that game's "Director."
What kind of production is the game? (A movie, A TV Show, etc...)
What's it's title?
Any known actors playing the parts of NPCs?
Each session of any game your group plays earns each attending player one point of "Sway."
Before each session, the Director decides how many points of Sway are required for an actor to call "CUT!"
When an actor spends Sway to call "CUT!" The cameras stop rolling, and players assume the role of their actors.
The actor who called "CUT!" must now play out a scene, explaining why they needed to stop the action. 
The results of this scene grant that actor a small bonus in the current production.
Examples:
Actor demands to know their motivation. (Director gives a hint about an upcoming situation.)
Actor demands their stunt double steps in. (Character suffer no consequences from  current conflict.)
Actor asks for a reshoot. (Character receives a re-do on a recently failed action.)

# Home on the Range
```
In the Old West, ranch families struggle over generations to carve a place into the landscape.

Players represent a family. 
Turns are one generation. 
Actions are a person's life. 

Family Stats:
Social - action range
Strength - power of actions
Culture - wealth, engineering

Actions:
Spawn - place token on spot (costs wealth)
Rob - add rival spot's value to your wealth (costs strength)
Gather - add own spot production as wealth (costs culture)
Conflict - remove token on a spot (costs strength, culture)

Build a map of cards: shuffle normal deck then lay square  (# players) on a side. 
Rows are counties, Columns are societal strata, cells are "spots". 
Draw cards for turn order, then each pick a spot to flip and place a token. 
These tokens indicate ownership. 
Actions have to be within (Social) of a token of the same player.

Spots:
Hearts - grassland (gather, attack)
Diamonds - mountains (defend,  rob)
Clubs - water (gather, attack)
Spades - forest (defend, rob)

Gameplay:
Players take an action each turn.
It's stated as a summary of one life in a Spot.
If two players conflict, the Family Stats are compared. 
A tie is broken by everyone voting on which story was best.

When the map is exposed the most tokens "wins".
