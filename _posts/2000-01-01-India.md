# KALO MASH MUST DIE
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One player is KALO MASH, MINOTAUR CYBERNECROMANCER, RIGHTFUL RULER OF ALL THINGS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw your labyrinth fortress twice, once revealed, once hidden with Hazards, KALO MASH at the center.
Rate Hazards 2-5, totaling 30. 
Rate KALO MASH 6.

------------------------------------------
All others are Adventurers. Doomed heroes.
------------------------------------------

Describe yourself, 2 words.
Examples: "Orc Barbarian, Witch Hacker, Angry Bees"
Get 3 HP.

-------------------------------------------------
KALO MASH will CONQUER EARTH. KALO MASH MUST DIE.
-------------------------------------------------

Each Adventurer explores the labyrinth to reach KALO MASH. Reach and defeat KALO MASH, and KALO MASH dies.

Youngest starts, showing how they navigate. If they run into Hazard, KALO MASH stops them. They roll dice against KALO MASH.

Roll 1 die per HP, +1 for useful class, +1 for good plan, +1 if another Adventurer helps. KALO MASH rolls dice equal to Hazard number.

Higher total wins; KALO MASH wins ties. If Adventurer wins, Hazard goes away, turn passes left; otherwise, lose 1 HP, turn passes right.

If Adventurer has 0 HP, they die. Left and right gain 1 HP if at 1. KALO MASH makes a new Hazard rated 3.


--------
It Ends.
--------


If someone kills KALO MASH, they and any helper win.

# Commuter Skills
```
You're trying to get to work on transit during rush hour, and you're set to be exactly on time. 

Choose 1 skill- 1. Never stuck in traffic.2. The driver knows the route. 3. No construction on the line. 4. No one peed on that seat. 5. Never travelling with a thousand school children. 6. Never break down.  

You have twenty stops to get to your job. Before each stop, roll a d6. Whichever number you roll, the corresponding negative effect occurs. Ie/ roll a 1, traffic is horrendous. Roll a 2 your driver is new and lost. For each negative effect, lose 1 transit minute.  If you roll your chosen effect, gain one transit minute, making you less late. Whoever makes it to work in less time, wins! 

Tell the story of what has happened. You're all on the same bus/streetcar/subway, so when something happens to one of you, you can all tell the story of your own reactions. If George rolls a 4 (and it isn't their specialty) how do you all react to them sitting in pee? 

Transit- fun for everyone!

# Homestead
```
The land is desolate, yet the Farmer came to love this place.

Choose to play: the Farmer; the Wind and Sun; the Waters and Rain; the Black Earth; or Verdant Life. One player must be the Farmer.

Take a blank paper. This is the map of the homestead.

Each round of play is one season. Each season the Farmer will build upon their work, and one of the elemental forces will cause trouble in accordance with their nature. The rest shall help or hinder the Farmer by their whims.

Each season, every player takes one action:
To cause trouble 
To aid one another 
To cultivate the land
To speak and grow close
To show another your heart
Or they pass unseen

When you take an action, roll 1d4.
1- Things go better than expected
2- Things go as you planned them
3- Things go as you wish, but there is a drawback or flaw that must be addressed
4- You taste failure and your plan backfires

Whenever an action resolves, update the homestead accordingly. 

Play ends should the Farmer die, or should the land grow green and the Farmer come to love it.
```
<hr>

# Colony
```
Players take turns drawing a card from a 52 card shuffled deck and rolling a d20. 

On each player's turn, describe the development of a colony team sent to an unknown alien planet. 

At the start of the game, crew has just arrived and are coming out of cryo-stasis. Each player describes their crew member and picks a card suit to get a +2 on.

First card of each suit must describe initial state of its category. 

Keep a written journal summarizing events. Players must consider past events for what happens next.

A - 10 describes how interesting an event is. A boring. 10 interesting. JQK are exceptional events - use imagination.
d20 describes success of event. 1 is critical failure / disaster. 10 / 11 is not good or bad. 20+ is critical success leading to a breakthrough.

Event categories:
Heart - Crew... Social... Holiday...
Diamond - Technology... Building...
Club - Food... Resources...
Spade - Expeditions...

Game ends when deck is out of cards or a critical failure happens which would end the colony in some irreparable way. Critical failures can only happen with a roll of 1, and they don't have to be game ending they could simply remove some players from the game.
```
<hr>

# Succession
```
An old and heirless monarch sits the throne. The time has come to choose a successor. A proclamation is made. There shall be a test. Any may enter. One will be chosen to rule. The rest will be banished forever.

One player is the monarch. In a few words, they describe their reign, their kingdom, their character. Then, going clockwise from the monarch, each player presents their character.

There are three rounds. Each round, the monarch issues a challenge. This could be a question (which is the most important virtue of a monarch?), or a task (bring me the tooth of a mountain lion).

The players have two minutes to prepare their responses. Each player rolls a D6. The highest goes first, and then clockwise from them. On their turn, each player gives their character's answer, or describes how their character accomplishes the task.

At the end of the third round, the monarch pronounces the heir to the kingdom and explains why they were chosen. The heir then becomes the monarch and the next game begins. The new monarch may keep their character, or create a new monarch with a new kingdom.
```
<hr>

# Minutes to Midnight
```
One player is the runner, who recently discovered a significant secret.  

The other players are pursuers, who stop at nothing to prevent the secret getting out.

RUNNER: name and describe your character.  Take a piece of paper and write the secret somewhere on it. Fold in half and keep folded for the game.
  
PURSUERS:  in turn, name and describe your character, anywhere on one side of the folded paper  write a location.

RUNNER: anywhere on the folded paper, write the names of key contacts who may help you, one for each pursuer.  Write two locations significant to the secret.

THE RUN: Runner, choose a written location and describe traversing it.  Choose a contact to meet.

THE CHASE: a pursuer tears the folded page in a single, continuous, motion. If the letters of the current contact or location are torn, they are no longer safe for the runner.  Repeat THE RUN.  If not, repeat THE CHASE with the next pursuer.  

The game ends when every Pursuer has chased twice or the runner has spent two consecutive chases meeting the same contact, or traversing the same location.  

If the secret is understood from any single piece of unfolded paper, it's out. 
 
Recycle!

# Media-RPG
```
Each player, recording first person videos and sharing them by internet with rest of players, narrates how they move through the story the game-master (GM) is narrating. 

Each round represents a day and has this structure: 

 - Prelude: GM generates non-player character (NPC) recordings for updating the state of the game after the actions taken by the players the previous day and giving information for current day. 

 - Morning: Each player sends a video narrating his current state and its plan for today. 

 - Events: In order to go forward through the story proposed by the GM, players will have to describe individually what they want to do for solving current situation and how these events develop. Each time a player want to describe an event, will have to send two types of recordings: 
      · "Getting ready" recording, describing what is going to happen. According to this, the GM will tell the player some constraints for the event development. 
      · Conclusion recording, describing how the event developed taking into account the constraints the GM set. 

 - End of the day: Each player sends a video summarizing the day. 

GM and players can also send any multimedia resource (newspaper, photo, ...) that enhances the narration.

# 7sins
```
7sins

You will all die sinners or win through Redemption. 

You're holding hostages in a bank heist and rigged a time bomb for 1 hour, this isn't going to be easy. 

Set the timer. 

Escape or die.

========
Character creation.
========

Name:

Roll 19d8, adding 1 point to the characteristics in the following chart based on those rolls:

Roll - Characteristic

1 - Pride
2 - Gluttony
3 - Envy
4 - Lust
5 - Sloth
6 - Wrath
7 - Greed

8 - Redemption

========
Conflict Resolution.
========

When faced with conflict, like shooting someone or seducing cops, the GM may simply say you succeed or fail.

Or they can create an "Opportunity."

========
Opportunity.
========

GM will state a Sin this conflict relates to. 

The player may either concede, thus failing automatically but simultaneously losing 1 point in that Characteristic and gaining 1 point of Redemption. 

Or they can roll a d8. 

Rolling a 1 or below their Characteristic score gives a critical success with spectacularly good results. 

Rolling an 8 is a critical failure. You may die.

Anything in between gives an expected but average result.

========
Dying and Ascension
========

If a character dies, immediately roll a d8. 

Rolling their Redemption or below means they ascend, otherwise they are judged unworthy.

# Even More Aliens, Ever Less of Us...
```
Twelve marines are trying to reach an escape shuttle. Scan blips are increasing.

Divide the marines among the players. Give each marine a catchphrase.

(N-) means "roll 1d6, on 1-N keep that result (success), otherwise result is 0 (failure)".

COMBATS:
Describe how the marines are fighting back. Each one kills (2-) aliens.
Then, one random marine dies for each alien left. Survivors fight another round.
Once per game, a marine can kill (4-) aliens instead of (2-) by yelling his catchphrase.
Likewise, a marine can kill 1d6 aliens by sacrificing himself.

NON-COMBAT ACTIONS:
Test (2-), or (4-) for a colorful and appropriate description.

STORYLINE:

RESIDENTIAL AREA
Ambushed by 3d6 aliens

PASSAGEWAYS
1d6+1 aliens attack from the front and 1d6+1 from behind. Only two marines can fire each way, but only they may die that round.

SHUTTLEBAY
Three waves of 2d6, 2d6, and 4d6 aliens
Each wave, any marine that doesn't fight can test (2-) to find a functioning shuttle (allowing "takeoff" after current wave).

TAKEOFF
3d6 aliens attack the shuttle.
Only marines accepting to stay behind can fight. If they all die, the shuttle crashes.

# No Devil-child May Rule Us
```
King Obarru is dead. His surly and callow son Darian now rules. Darian's precocious and sophisticated younger sister Hylda gathers a cabal to tell a shocking tale: Queen Alykta consorted with the demon Tchernobog; the man on the throne is a devil-child and not the trueborn heir of Obarru. Hylda needs help developing proof to dispute the succession.

Players: one GM, one Devil, others are Agents.

Agents: Roll 1d6 for Spirit, subtract Spirit from 6 for Body. Choose a name and position in kingdom.

GM: You describe the world and role-play NPCs.

Devil: Secretly roll 1d6 to determine your children: [1: neither, 2-3: Darian, 4-5: Hylda, 6: both]. You don't directly play, use your ability deceive (or reveal truth!) to manipulate things to your liking.

The devil is in the details: Whenever an Agent inspects, probes, or discerns for details roll 1d6. If greater than or equal to Spirit: Devil whispers or passes note to GM telling them what the Agent perceives. The GM describes things as truthfully as they can, consistent with Devil's directives.

To perform difficult or NPC-opposed physical action roll 1d6: under Body succeeds, otherwise you fail, the GM describes how.

# Stakeout
```
You'll need:
2-4 players
A car (preferably a 70s sedan)
Eight uninterrupted hours (10pm-6am recommended)
A part of town that's just a little bit on the seedy side (neither too busy nor too quiet)
An occupied building (such as a residence or business)
A thermos of cheap coffee
No distractions

Drive to the play location and park the car across the street from the building, a little ways up the block.

Hour 0:
Good spirits.
Who's that guy entering/leaving the building? Is he involved in the case?

Hour 2:
Order food, the greasier the better.
Speculate about what the perps are doing in the building.

Hour 4:
Tensions building.
Each player in turn: dredge up some old shit from one of the other characters' past; grumble about it; start an argument; lapse into stony silence.

Hour 6:
Coffee's gone.
If a player falls asleep, nudge them awake and give them shit for sleeping on the job.

Hour 8:
The next shift relieves you and the game ends; drive home.

(Note: if the actual police show up and question you, pause the game and cooperate. End the game and leave the area if instructed to do so.)

# Die Zombies!
```
Can you survive the zombie apocalypse? Guide a band of plucky survivors to the last remaining secure settlement.

A game for two players. One controls the zombie encounters and rewards, the other controls the team of survivors.

Player 1 gets one d10 and 1 d6. Player 2 gets 5 survivor tokens and two d6s. 

Play starts with player 1 describing the encounter, and rolls the d10 to determine the number of zombies encountered, a roll of 0 is 10 zombies. Both players roll for initiative with 1 d6 each. If player 1 rolls high, it is a surprise encounter. If surprised, player 2 rolls only one d6 during this encounter, if not, player 2 rolls 2 d6s.

During the encounter, both players roll their d6s. Players compare highest rolls. If Player 2 wins, ties going to Player 2, one zombie is killed. If Player 1 wins, one survivor token is killed.

If all zombies are killed, Player 1 describes what they win, either food, ammo, medicine or even additional survivors. Play moves to the next encounter. If all survivors die, the game is over. If Player 2 wins 10 scenarios, they win the game.

# The Witch's Familiars
```
A wicked Witch is preparing an important potion for her devious masterplan.
You've destroyed the last ingredient but are given one final task out of mercy: Find. More.
You'll need at least two players: a Game Master (GM) and a Familiar.
The GM sets the scene and calls for rolls. The ingredient can be whatever you want and it can be in a farmer's basement or in a dragon's lair! 
All familiars act according to four core STATs and different bonuses: 
Body: Physical actions.
Mind: Strategy and guile.
Luck: Wacky plans!
Magic: All arcane craziness!
You have four familiars to choose from:
Cat - Body+2 | Luck+1
Bat - Mind+2 | Body+1
Spider - Luck+2 | Magic+1
Wisp - Magic+2 | Mind+1
Whenever a Familiar acts, they roll a d6+Bonus (the GM chooses what STAT is appropriate). The action succeeds on a 6 or higher. Weave failures into the story without being too harsh! 
The Magic STAT is an exception. On Magic rolls, a 4 or higher succeeds. Nonetheless, the Familiar's bodies can't undergo such arcane duress, the second time you fail a Magic role, you disintegrate and are out of the game!
Have fun being silly critters!
```
<hr>

# The Scoop
```
One player (The Scoop) describes a mystery: a crime, victim, scene, and some physical evidence. They're questioned by the other players (Detectives). The Scoop voices witnesses, suspects, and the environment. Any player can craft reality; a Detective could notice a bar and question the bartender. The Scoop would play the bartender.

The Detectives share a shuffled deck of playing cards minus JQK for investigating leads. The Scoop has an equivalent deck for determining responses. 

For every interaction with a scene or witness, The Scoop draws the top card of their deck and keeps it secret. If the witness is guilty, double the value. This is the value to beat. The Detectives flip one card to interact and can add a second to examine/interrogate. High value wins. Ace beats anything but if both sides have an Ace, The Scoop wins.

Results:
Detectives win: The Scoop's helpful (evidence, insight)
The Scoop wins: The Scoop's misleading (red herrings, lies)
Tie: dead end--nothing interesting

At any time the Detectives can accuse a suspect. If they're correct, they win! Otherwise remove 5 cards from their deck. If the Detective's deck runs out, the trail's gone cold; the Scoop wins and reveals the mystery!

	- Say how the PLAGUE spreads

[	Good questions:						                                        ]
[	- What / who was this [place] / [person]?			                ]
[      	- What's [at risk] / [at odds with my knowledge]?    		        ]
[	- What / who [brought] / [was affected by] the plague here?	]
[	- What's really [going on] / [wrong] here?			                        ]
[      	- What's been done to counteract the plague?    		                ]

Act in turns (when you're up choose one). The PLAGUE:
	- CHANGES: Exchange [your TONE] / [the map] with another player.

# The Apocalypse but like ... Right Now
```
As your group sits down for a night of RPG fun, the apocalypse begins. The nature of the apocalypse is determined by the group and can be anything from zombie invasions to natural disasters. Determine three consequences your selected apocalypse has on your surroundings (ex: severe flooding, enemies roaming the streets, etc).
 
Pick a location at least one mile from your current position that all players are familiar with. That location is your safe house. Your goal is to navigate to the safe house while surviving the apocalypse. Your ability to succeed is determined by your real-life capabilities.
 
Abilities: Some tasks require physical skills to complete. To complete the task, the player must perform a comparable action out of game. To vault a table in-game, you must prove that you can jump as high as said table out of game. To dive underwater and retrieve an item in-game, you must hold your breath for the same amount of time out of game.

Provisions: Everything in your vicinity is fair use.
 
Craft: If a player wants to combine or re-purpose their provisions, they must describe the process to create their desired product as well as succeed on an appropriate ability check.

# Sticker Monsters
```
You're a trainer of monsters, questing through the land to do good with your adorable companions!

Find your monster!
. get two stickers, combine them into a unique monster
. draw a box around it
. draw some special effects

Find other trainers!
Either out in the wild or in your own home.

Solve Problems!
Look around and pick something to turn into a weird, fantastical problem. You both need to provide one Move each and one to combine with the other trainer's monster. Describe your monster and narrate these moves to solve the problem! Mark 2XP each.

Or You Can Battle!
Describe your monsters, pick and describe a Move. Both briefly discuss which would get type advantage. They win the round. Play a second time with remaining moves and a third if there's a tie. If still tied, flip a coin. Winner marks 3XP, Loser marks 1XP.

# Phenomena
```
Use a deck of 52 poker cards.

The guide setup a location where strange phenomena occur. 
The players say who they are and describe something strange they have witnessed. 

When the guide describes something strange, if the players interact with the phenomenon they turns over a card.

If the card is black the guide narrates something horrific, if the card is red something wondrous. 

The players can continue to turn cards to interact with the phenomenon. 
If they score 21 they make a discovery and the scene concludes positively for them.
If they bust over 21 someone is hurt and the scene concludes negatively.  
If they fight or flight they keep their hand and the guide draws cards against them.
If the guide beats their hand without busting 21 someone is killed, otherwise the players narrate the outcome. 

When the players score 21, they put a card aside for the final scene, when they bust the guide chooses the card. The game ends when the final hand scores or exceeds 21. 
The color that appears the most determines the nature of the final scene (horrific or wondrous). 
The players survive if they score 21 and die if they bust.

# This Rare Fabric
```
A game for 4+ deities.

---

The world is 1d10x10 years old.
Your age is 2d10x100.
Together you have made d100 worlds before, but this is the one that will work.

Over time the population has grown steadily and faith in you has waxed and waned - currently each of you have 500 followers.

In turn each of you performs an action to improve the world, shape it how you see fit.
You roll d100 to see the number of followers you gain as a result of your action.
You roll d100 again to see how many you lose.

The pantheon then discusses the impact your action has upon your fledgling world - the more followers you have the louder your voice.

The next deity then takes their turn.

---

When a deity has no followers remaining they may no longer take actions but can still discuss the actions of others as part of the pantheon.

If the all the pantheon agree the world no longer needs them then their work is done.
If the world has lost all faith in half the pantheon (rounded down) then all hope is lost and thoughts must turn to starting anew.

# Born of Brier and Blood: A Game for Four
```
You are a creature of story, stitched together bits of whisper, born of brier and blood. Once the village left offerings freely, but they've put away their childish fears. Now there is room for only one.

To begin: Each speak your true name and countenance. Sing of your power. Choose a suit of cards and tell how it influences your hunger. Reveal a truth of the village. Shuffle the deck.

Your Sway, the village's belief in you, starts at 0. 

Taking turns: 

Reveal a card. 

The owner of the suit revealed picks an action for you and sets the scene. If you reveal your own suit, select the player who will do this. 

The player who revealed the card tells how they complete the action and the other tells how the village reacts. 

Decide, as a group, if your Sway increases or decreases by the value of the card (Aces = 1, Faces = 11).

Actions: 

Reveal your power 
Appease a villager 
Demand tribute
Fight the village's advancement
Explore the wilderness
Indulge your hunger

When the deck is empty, the highest Sway is remembered. Tell how the villagers revere you. The others fade, like stories do. Tell what you feed on now.

# Old Wounds
```
Firelight flickers on a small group of ancient, wizened faces. These warriors are scared but still burning with old hatred. 

Players are chieftains of rival tribes, arguing out old feuds and trying to get what they want out of a peace treaty. 

You need: Index Cards and D6s 

Write a card describing who you are, who your tribe is, and what your people cherish most. 

Then write one Demand card per rival with something you want from them out of the treaty.

Write 2 cards per rival describing an Old Conflict between you and any rival. You can play any number of these against any rival. Keep these hidden in your hand. 
Take turns choosing a rival and an old conflict to start an argument. After the argument is roleplayed, each non-involved rival decides who "won" the argument and gives that player a dice. Put it on the appropriate Demand card.

Whomever played the conflict gets one dice on that Demand. After all conflicts have been played, take turns rolling the dice from each Demand against each rival. 

The winner gets what they want from that rival. Roleplay these out to find the fate of the tribe and the treaty!

# Put Away Childish Things
```
You are a teenager, chatting with classmates after school. You deeply love something that you're sure is only for children. You don't know anyone who shares your passion.

-------------------

Pick your passion, keep it secret.

3 or 4 players, pick from:
 * those studded building blocks
 * that friendship cartoon

5 or 6 players, add:
 * that colourful martial arts super-team
 * those funny animal comics

More players, add:
 * dinosaurs
 * that tabletop game with dragons

These things are childish and uncool. It's cool to hate them now, but acceptable to admit you liked them when you were a child.

-------------------

You want to:
 * talk about your passion as much as possible;
 * find someone who shares your interest;
 * prove you're cool and adult.

You must:
 * disparage childish things in conversation;
 * mock anyone whose passion is revealed publicly, even if you share it.

You can:
 * discuss how you liked passions in the past, but, you know, intellectually;
 * probe how others feel or felt about passions.

Secretly gain points:
 * coolness, by disparaging any passion, even yours;
 * satisfaction, by mentioning your own passion positively;
 * participation, by mentioning another passion positively.

-------------------

You win if you find someone who shares your passion.
You lose if someone mocks you when your passion's revealed.

# Liquid Courage
```
Obtain a pitcher of beverage and filled cups for all players. Alcohol optional (please drink responsibly). This is your COURAGE.

Discuss what DIFFICULT GOAL your group faces (a heist, conquering an enemy base, seeing a sold out concert, etc), your characters, and why you ABSOLUTELY MUST succeed.

To play, a volunteer describes a threatening COMPLICATION that stands in the way of the GOAL. Another player then describes how they COURAGEOUSLY overcome this problem and drink until the previous player decides they've used enough COURAGE to succeed. The drinker now describes the next COMPLICATION and play continues.

If the player doesn't have enough COURAGE, other players may help by pouring more beverage (from the pitcher or their own cup) into the active player's cup.  Describe how you bolster their COURAGE as you pour.

When you run out of beverage you are out of COURAGE and can no longer act COURAGEOUSLY.

Play until you meet the goal, everyone is out of COURAGE, or everyone is too drunk and rowdy to keep it together. Collectively decide on the aftermath and HEAP ACCOLADES on the most courageous player and HARSHLY ROAST the least courageous player. If you achieved the goal, celebrate with another drink.

# Fade From Black
```
IMPORTANT: Before play, please have a frank conversation about safety, boundaries, and comfort.

Your characters are in a relationship and have just had sex. 

Describe your characters: How you look, how you smell, what you are doing etc.

For each other player, write on a notecard how your character felt about theirs throughout the encounter and how that might change their relationship:

      (CHARACTER) made me feel/was (DESCRIPTION), and I want to/that made me (REACTION).

Tear up each notecard into 3 pieces, showing as equal amount of information as possible. Note on each part who it relates to but keep them hidden.

Then, taking turns, pick a topic. Together play out or describe a scene of your characters addressing the topic: talking, playing, teasing, touching.

- A reflection on how we met
- Gossip on a mutual friend's relationship
- Something significant that happened today
- (Make some more up, I'm out of words)

As the scene plays out, when players agree that a moment of intimacy has been shared, they may each reveal one piece of paper to each other and end the scene.

Play until all pieces of paper are revealed, and end by describing together what you each do afterward.

# United Narrative Opportunity
```
Requires:
1-4 Storytellers
Uno cards
Paper 
Pencil


Whoever told a story last starts the game.


Remove all 0 cards from the Uno deck. Give a 0 card to each storyteller.  

Shuffle the deck and place it somewhere centered amongst yourselves. Deal three cards to each storyteller.

Each storyteller places their 0 card anywhere parallel horizontal to the deck. Your story starts here.  


Begin each turn by playing one card from your hand, building a path from your 0 card in any direction. If your card doesn't match your previous card's color or number, draw two cards. You may intersect another storyteller's path. 
 
Tell your tale as you play. Use the color and number of your cards as guides. 

Red. Danger or Passion?

Yellow. Caution or Epiphany?

Blue. Despair Or Peace?

Green. Fortune or Misfortune?

Numbers may represent level of intensity.

 
Once you have said your part, the storyteller on your left begins their turn. Collaboration is encouraged; action cards (i.e. Skip, Draw Two) will affect the next storyteller.    

To conclude your story, end your turn with an empty hand or seven cards. 




You may break from the game and return at any point. Write what inspires you.

# Wreckscum
```
You make your living plumbing the phantom depths of the Stygian Reach. You have a tethered diving suit, void harpoon, and financial obligations (Rent, tithes for Mother Eel, etc.) How did you end up here? What's the alternative? How much Treasure will you need?

Explore. Breath in the strangeness. Slowly. Quietly. When you're ready to dive deeper, roll 2D6 and draw a card. If the result is higher than your Silence (starting: 10), you're Noticed. If you're already Noticed, the Reach claims you as its own. If your card is (a):

Red: Abyssal Creature. Describe its terrifying features. How infinite is its maw? Flee (-1 Silence) or Fight (spend Silence and roll 1D per Silence spent). If over the value it becomes a Treasure. If you lose the Fight, sacrifice a Treasure to escape. Otherwise, you're devoured.

Black: Treasure; Relics of the Sunken Ones. What was its purpose? How has the sea tainted it? Discard or pay 1 Silence to keep.

Face: +1D3 Silence. Refuge; temporary respite. Describe it.

Ace/Joker: Opportunities. How do you navigate the dark? Draw +2 cards. Keep one; ignore one.

Return to the ship when ready. Count your Treasures, is it enough?
