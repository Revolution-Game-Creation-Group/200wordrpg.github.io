You are a heroine in a regency or Victorian novel. So is your best friend. Though apart, you write letters to each other. 

You will both need notecards, paper, pens - fountain or quill. Biros will Not Do. Tea & cake optional.

-: Create Your Heroines :-

Describe your personality. Pick a Virtue, a Vice, a Hope. Embrace those 19th century values.
Describe your family. What does Father do? What is Mother like?

How did you meet? Each describe a special moment you share. Why did you part?

-: Setup :- 

On notecards write one each of:
MEETING
GUEST
COURTSHIP
BIRTH
SCANDAL
DEATH
QUARREL
PROPOSAL

Shuffle, deal half to each player.

-: Play :-

Players sit in separate rooms. No interaction between players or their characters except by letter. Maintain the illusion.

An Event happened this Spring. Draw a notecard - interpret imaginatively. 

Use pen & paper to write a letter to your friend. Describe your event. Ask them questions about their life; answer theirs. Develop shared history & supporting characters. Channel your inner Austen, BrontÃ«, Eliot.  

When done, post it under the door. Read the letter posted to you.

Repeat for Summer, Autumn, Winter.

SOLO VARIANT: You write letters, but never receive replies. You wonder why.

## Author Comments 

This RPG was inspired by Regency novels and dramas, and the tactility of writing letters by hand.
