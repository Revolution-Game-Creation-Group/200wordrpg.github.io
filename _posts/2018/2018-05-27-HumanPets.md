```
at least 3 players: owner, one or more pets , keeper (controls everything else).

all animals turned into humans overnight.

owner: describe why you need your pets , choose their name, describe them.

pet: describe your feelings for the owner. describe which human rights you were denied as a pet.Describe your human form.

keeper: set a scene for the first meeting between owner and transformed pets. the cellphone loudly announce the government will come to take away all pets in 24 hours. Determine a nearby government-safe place.
any conflict advances the clock by 1 hour.The keeper introduces an external conflict every 10 minutes.

conflicts ( keeper vs owner, owner vs pet etc...): one party aims for a match, the other for a nonmatch. Both draw a circle,square,triangle then reveal their hand and see if the symbols match or not."match" only needs two matches to win.The winner describes the outcome of the conflict.

conflicts advantages :
using a tool (once every 5 hours)= draw two different symbols instead of one
other player helping= the player enters the conflict and draws an extra symbol. 

the game ends once the 24 hours are expired. whatever situation the players are is final.
