Split 4+ players between contentious "Minority"/"Majority" factions.  

You're fashionistas vlogging before and after Revolution. 

DEFINE "Fashion" ("everyday human-ish," "cybernetics," ... ).

Grab any 2 magazines.

Everyone:  Glue together a paperdoll representing your fashionista using body-parts cut from magazines.

To CONSUME Fashion, each faction spends 6 minutes cutting pictures of attire from magazines (clothing, accessories, hairstyles, ...).  Cut hastily, roughly.  Majority cuts first.  Factions keep separate wardrobes.

Every season, each faction picks one word on the flipside of any cutout.  These're TRENDING Revolution-related hashtags.  Interpret their meanings.  Incorporate them during roleplaying.



~WINTER (BEFORE REVOLUTION)~

Consume Fashion.

MINORITY:  Speaking as your fashionistas, roleplay #GetReadyWithMe videos showing morning routines.  Model Fashion on paperdolls.  

	Discuss:

	*Today's agenda.
	*How outfit complements agenda.
	*Vlogosphere drama.

MAJORITY:  Roleplay Holiday #OutfitOfTheDay videos modeling festive Fashion.  

	Discuss:

	*Holiday.
	*How outfit reflects traditions.
	*Family.

CRITIQUE everyone! (clothes fit paperdoll?  accessorized?  ...)



~REVOLUTION!~

Players swap factions!

Discard all Fashion!



~SPRING (AFTER REVOLUTION)~

Consume Fashion.

MINORITY:  Roleplay Holiday #OutfitOfTheDay videos.

	Discuss:

	*Holidays: what's changed?
	*#currentmood.
	*Family.

MAJORITY:  Roleplay #HAUL videos.  Unbox multiple Fashion acquisitions ("shoe haul").

	Discuss:

	*How life's improved.
	*Favorite postrevolutionary brands.
	*Rival vloggers.

Critique everyone!



~!!!~

>After SPRING, return to WINTER.  Check magazines:

>>Fashion scarcity?  REDEFINE Fashion ("No more clothes?  Wear flesh.")

>>Empty?  End.

Thanks to the 200 word reddit for encouragement/feedback.  Was gonna post some awesome Migos lyrics in this space, but I can't decide which ones to post.  Sorry.
