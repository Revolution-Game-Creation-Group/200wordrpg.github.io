# Aardvark Clergy Of Tank River City 4 Â½
```
At the beginning of the game each player rolls 5 times and adds these words to their "Word Bank". They can use them at any time during an encounter. Players can use as many words as they want so long as they exceed or match the target number. 
The GM rolls 5 times from a separate table and does the same. They use those words to establish the encounter and roll a D6 to establish the difficulty (6's are rerolled).

The difficulty of the encounter will determine the number of words to use: Easy 1, Medium 2, Difficult 3, Hard 4, Impossible 5

Use those words to talk about how the characters resolve the encounter.

When the GM is out of words the person on the right of the GM becomes the new GM. Players reroll up to 5 words. Play continues until everyone was GM once.

# Corny Action Heroes!
```
This game's about collaborative storytelling.

What you'll need:
 -Some Pens
 -Some Paper
 -Some Imagination
 -A Coin

GM Stuff
As the GM, your job is to provide the setting, the plot, to control the NPCs and enemies, and to moderate the character creation. Any genre will do.

Player Stuff
You can describe your four Action Hero Powers using 40 words total. Distribute the 100 words however you like. Beware, ambiguity benefits the GM, so word your powers carefully. Draw inspiration from corny action movies and shows.

ABILITIES are powers that can be used once per encounter.

SKILL are powers that can be used freely.

TALENTS prevents specific things from happening to your character once per encounter.

QUALITIES prevent a specific thing from happening to your character.

RESOLVING conflict requires your GM to flip a coin. Affected players must call the flip in the air. Successfully calling the flip means your Power worked correctly.

If successfully attacked, characters ascend the Doom Ladder:

GRAZED: GM chooses one power you lose.

INJURED: GM chooses a second

CRIPPLED: And a third

DEAD: You lose all powers but can still come back with some plot tomfoolery.

DOOMED: You are permanently out of the game.

# Gathering For The Oracle
```
Needs: 

Bucket of water 
Coin 
Box to stand on


You are all gathered together to receive the oracle. Choose a priest/priestess.

"The Portent" = Who, What, Where, When, How.

"The Strife" = "The king has gone mad." or "Our children have gone missing." 

Strife ideas are whispered to the Priest/Priestess.

+++++Game begins+++++

Priest/Priestess declares one strife standing on a box with the bucket of water in front of her. She holds the coin.

She then states the "Portent" of her choosing. For example: "Where".

The priestess chooses which one of the gathered gets to ascend to the box and answer the portent as it relates to the strife.

As that person is elaborating, the gathered may yell: 

"Hear, Hear!" if they want them to keep going with their thread. 

Conversely, they will yell: "They LIE! 

If this happens, the Priest/Priestess ascends the box and drops the coin into the water. Heads = new person continues the thread.

Before the next person ascends the box, the priestess will state the next Portent they will need to express.

When the Priest/Priestess feels all the Portents have been answered, the game ends. 

The Oracle has spoken.

# Get Down, Mr President
```
A pervasive roleplaying game for 5+ people.

You are all Agents. Gather in a public space and go about your business, keeping an eye on each other.

Suddenly, an earpiece squawks.

One of you raises a hand to their ear to listen. Everyone else, if you see a fellow Agent raise their hand to their ear, do the same and say "Copy" loudly. Any Agent may instead say "Negative," causing all hands to be dropped. No Agent may do this twice in a row.

When all but one Agent has raised their hand, those Agents shout "GET DOWN, MR. PRESIDENT", and proceed to take the remaining player to the ground (agree beforehand on how physical this should be) before hurriedly escorting them out of them room.

If the remaining Agent is female, everyone must instead shout "BUT THE EMAILS" and run around like idiots.

Repeat as many times as you want. Maybe keep score or something.
```

# More Than Human
```
The players are human Minds, computer-simulated by a starship travelling the galaxy. Upon reaching a system, the Minds are downloaded into "printed" Bodies for exploration. 

Mind: Choose 3 positive skills (totaling +7) & 3 negative skills (totaling -7). 

Body: Anything you can imagine (with GM approval). Gives +1 to two skills and -1 to one skill.

Skills are limited to +/-5.

Heart: +1 Heart point for each system entered. Dice are heartless: spending a Heart point allows re-rolling one action. 

The GM dreams up some "episodes" for systems. Example: "Ship sucked in by giant space amoeba, killable only with antimatter". 

The GM describes a system, and the Minds design Bodies in response. As the episode's plot unfolds, Minds decide what their Bodies do; the GM decides the difficulty of these actions and appropriate skills to use:

The player rolls 3d6+skill & the GM rolls 3d6+difficulty. The GM describes success/failure proportional to how much over/under the roll is. A tie equals marginal success. Bad failures might kill a Body for this episode. 

The GM may reward good play with Heart points, pluses players can assign to skills, or items/Bodies that add to some skill.

Storytellers:

Enemies and Environment Elements have Tags that describe them; DM uses them to decide if a task is Easy or Hard (+/- 1 die to roll). Enemy Endurance ranges from 0 to 4. Environments have 1 to 4 Tags.

Artifacts break the rules. Go wild.

Tell a story together. Make it awesome.

# Oneirica - Dream or Die
```
"At first it was just us falling asleep and never waking up. Billions stuck in fantasies or lost in nightmares. Eventually, some of us showed mastery in dreaming and coming back to life. We gathered around the remains of the old world and started fighting back against the dreams, pulling back those we could save. Many minds and lives were lost in a never-ending uphill war.

Then They appeared from beyond the wall of sleep, forcing our/their eyes open and trying to invade our world, through force or subterfuge. The war spilled over."

You are a Dream Diver - someone who can still wake up and come back. Your D-goggles, mouth guard, and playlist are your weapons and best friends deep under. Each night you try to dream others back into awakening, surviving yours and theirs deepest subconscious.

When asleep, you search and fight for loved ones, friends, random strangers. Every sleeper coming back counts. They're all new recruits.

You've dreamed many things, but your biggest fear are the Nightmare Ones, mysterious alien minds who may have started it all.

There are not many like you left, but you can't and won't give up. The world must wake up again.

# The Greatest Epic Poem
```

In this game, you take the role, of a person, all do know him

a group of Bards recounting their tales

In the form of an epic poem

Each player must simply choose a name, and an adjective they attribute to their character.
 
The Lead Bard functions as a game master, and starts the poem with a short rhyme detailing where they are and what they need to do. From then on, the group sits in a circle and tells the story, the lead bard says a line,  ("The group sat by the mountainside, when they saw a sallow man"), To which a bard reply with their action or speech ("I walked over merrily, to offer him a hand").  The lead bard will sing every other line, and the group take turns replying in a circle. 
If a bard is unable to make a rhyme, or if 10 seconds pass, the interaction goes unfavorably. If the bard makes a rhyme, it goes well. If the Bard makes a rhyme and his action plays to his adjective, The Lead bard may choose to reward him, pointing at him while saying his line as a gesture to reply to him again.

# Rules as God

# Perseus V
```
Eighteen years into the voyage to Perseus V and something has gone terribly wrong.

One player is the ship's AI core, potentially damaged and unstable after long years in space. Announce your name and mission.

The other players are crew members, woken from cryosleep. Announce your name, special skill, and what you left behind on Earth.

From a standard deck, the AI draws cards equal to twice the number of crew, plus one.

More black cards means you are BENIGN; more red means you are HOSTILE. Shuffle and stack them in secret.

The AI provides someone a PERILOUS SCENARIO and DUBIOUS REQUEST. E.g. "The cargo bay is burning. Override the airlocks to vent our air reserves."

They take a card and narrate what happens. Red means some harm befalls the mission. Black is a beneficial result. Repeat this step.

Once everyone has acted, one crew can narrate a PERSONAL SACRIFICE to reveal an extra card.

The crew must now decide whether to DEACTIVATE the AI or TRUST it to guide them onwards.

If the AI is deactivated it loses; otherwise it wins.

If the crew trust a benign AI or deactivate a hostile AI, they win; otherwise they lose.

# Heart of the Character Cards
```
Players are researchers for different Mega-Corporations exploring Phobos, a mysterious moon around Mars, a deck of playing cards. Whenever a player performs an action, they draw a card to determine their character's motivation for the upcoming action based on the suit and value, from 2 low to Ace high. The value determines how well the action was executed, not the outcome.

Heart is acting from the heart.
Diamond is acting logically.
Spade is acting for personal gain.
Club is acting for the group.

For example, I notice a mysterious silhouette and draw a Diamond 10. I could take my time (10) to analyze and identify (Diamond) the object. If I drew a Club 2, I clumsily (2) report to the group (Club) about the mysterious object.

The game is over when the cards run out. The player who drew the most cards chooses another player to tell the ending.

Alternatively, this system can be used as a supplement to more traditional RPGs as well. Players draft 13 cards to draw from and reshuffles after every draw. When players have great RP, the GM can give card upgrades (Spade 2 to 3) or a new card associated with the RP.

# Deck Heroes
```
Each player builds from a standard deck of cards:
...Character Deck - All Picture cards (J=1, Q=2, K=3)
...Action Deck - The Rest (Ace to 10 plus Jokers)

Build Character:
Spend from Character Deck to acquire stats.
4 Primary Stats: 2=average human
...Strength
...Charm
...Agility
...Smarts
Remainder become Power Deck. 

Select Power Theme (Magic, Tech, etc)

Any Test:
Draw cards equal to applied Stat rank.
Select one card to apply:
...Ace drawn = apply Queen power effect.
...Joker drawn = discard highest drawn card.
Compare Card value to difficulty
...Easy Task is 5
...In PvP: highest value wins
...Difference is the scale of success/damage.

Discard the chosen card plus 1 other, shuffle rest into action deck.
If have Stat of 1: draw two cards, take lowest value. Discard both.

Damage received equals cards discarded from action deck.
Unconscious if no cards left to draw. 
Recreate each deck after a rest.

Play power cards to use superpowers: 
...higher rank = more power.
...Remains in effect until applied to a test.
Effects in a test are equal to value:
...Return discarded cards to deck
...Draw more cards
...Multiply highest drawn card value
Then shuffle into Action deck (action value is 10).

# The Insight Framework
```
A traditional tabletop-RPG setup for 3-5 players and a GM, where players' character backstories have a much greater impact on the game. The system can be adapted for settings from fantasy through modern-day to sci-fi.

Pre-game:
Players write character backstories and give the GM a copy. Characters have 4 stats: 
- Power
- Agility
- Charm 
- Wit 

At GM's discretion, players assign 1-5 points to each stat (from a pool of 12) using their backstory as inspiration. Each point is worth 1d6 for skill checks. Players must beat a DC depending on the difficulty of the check.

During game:
When it is time to make a skill check, one of three things can happen: 
- Players announce an existing part of their backstory and say how that will give them an advantage in that situation
- Players announce a new part of their backstory that doesn't contradict what is already written, state how that gives them an advantage, and permanently add it to their backstory
- The GM announce something from the player's backstory, giving them a disadvantage to the particular check.

When this happens, the GM can choose to add or take away one point from all future checks of that type.

# The Dead Flag Blues (based on the song)
```
These are truly the last days.

Your group may be all that is left.
More is better. Less is lonely.

The rubble of six-sided dice is Death.
Roll one. Place it in the middle. This is Salvation.

Everyone takes two dice from Death and rolls one to get that many more.
Hide what you wish. Nobody can make you show. This is Life.
Should you lose all your Life, go unto Death.

Take turns exploring. Scavenge, scout.

No volunteers? Discuss. Vote.
Or, draw straws. Everyone rolls. Lowest goes. Reroll ties.

More than one wants to go?
Discuss. Vote. Or, draw straws.

Go into the belly of this horrible machine.
Roll one die from Life. This is now Providence.
Describe everything.

If Providence surpasses Salvation, the others lose Providence in Life unto Death.
Distribute as you wish. Those who cannot pay perish.
Why did you fail?

If Salvation surpasses Providence, the others gain Providence in Life from Death.
Distribute as you wish.
What did you find?

If Salvation is Providence, nothing changes.
What was your daydream?

Salvation goes unto Death. Perhaps you too.
Providence is now Salvation. 

Build on what happened.
Decide who goes next.
Fall further down.
Godspeed you.

# Dungeon of the Four Kings
```
One deck of cards shuffled
Lots of d6, 5 to each of the 4 players, who then set aside 3d6, this is their "edge".

Players choose a suit of cards as their kingdom, and a class Wizard, Rogue, Fighter.

Flip the top card. If it's your suit roll 2d6, if the sum is >= the card value, you pass the challenge, discard that card. An edge die can be spent to add an additional d6 to your total.

If a face card is drawn, each other player rolls 2d6, and the player of that suit can defend it. The player that captures the card gains 1 edge, and the card is discarded. If no player captures the card the defender gains 1 edge, and the card is shuffled back into the deck. If multiple players roll high enough to capture the card, the highest roller wins. Aces give 1 edge to that kingdoms player.

Defending Skills 1 edge per use
Wizard: roll d6, <5 one attack misses
Rogue: re-roll one die
Fighter: add 1 to card value

A player loses the game when they are unable to pass a challenge, or their king is captured.

# To Turn a Card
```
There are four conflicts, and a suit for each.

-Hearts/Emotional
-Clubs/Physical
-Diamonds/Mental
-Spades/Social

Assign 6, 7, 7, 8 to these conflicts. Draw three cards: these are your conclusions. Write them down. Shuffle them into the deck.

Each scene, slowly reveal a card. The suit determines your conflict in the scene. Set a scene. Compare the value to your value for that suit, and weave your story. If the value exceeds yours, resolve the scene against you in some manner. Replace the card. Shuffle the deck.

If you draw one of your conclusions, end your story during the scene.

If you wish to add chance to an outcome, draw a card and compare its value to the most relevant conflict. If the value exceeds yours, resolve the outcome against you. If the action is opposed, resolve the outcome against whoever draws the lowest difference vs. their conflict value.

In all cases, the deck wins ties.

# Trivial Detectives
```
One player is the murderer, who has left clues for the detectives to uncover. The remaining players are detectives, who must interact with the environment and suspects, played by the murderer, to uncover the truth and make an arrest.

Each detective has six attributes, ranked from 1 (the detective's strength) to 6 (the detective's weakness):

Geography
	A detective's ability to navigate and knowledge of geography

Entertainment
	A detective's ability to maintain a suspect's attention and knowledge of popular culture

History
	A detective's knowledge of political and natural history

Arts
	A detective's creative ability and knowledge of classical culture

Science
	A detective's knowledge of discoveries and phenomena

Sports
	A detective's physical ability and knowledge of sports history

Whenever a detective takes an action that tests an attribute, the murderer draws a number of Trivial Pursuit cards equal to that attribute's rank, and reads the relevant question from each card, one card at a time, to the player playing that detective. If the player gets a question wrong, the detective fails. If the player gets all of the questions correct, the detective succeeds.

When the detectives agree on which suspect is guilty, they make an arrest, and the murderer reveals the truth.

# Charming friends and magic cakes.
```
An epistolary magic bakery roleplaying game.

In a universe where there are magical ingredients that could affect the mood of the commensals... a group of friends, scholars of Magic Bakery, keep correspondence with each other. They write about their lives, problems, and desires, and they cook special cakes to affect the lives of their friends.

Phases:
1.- Together the players define the universe where the game will take place.
2.- Define a magic system or use an existing one. The system must complement real-life recipes, just use magic variations, for example: add felicitas sugar (improves happiness), iracundias leavening and negatus flour (negates anger).
3.- Each player defines the character they will play. Start narrating it to the others by turn, explaining your current situation.
4.- Go home and send real letters to each other in character. Attach a bakery recipe. Attach a "consequence" for the recipe.
5.- The character that receives a recipe, bakes it, eats it and reads the "consequence". Apply the magical effect to her character, further developing her and the story.
6.-  Answer each letter back in character.
7.- Repeat and enjoy the cakes. Play, maybe, for some weeks, months or a whole life.

A group of people have been stopped by the local lawman who has reports that a party matching their description vandalized a restricted area.

The players, having a completely legitimate excuse for having been in the area, ask for the opportunity to explain. They are given 3 minutes.

Play begins when the designated lawman selects the setting, sets the scene including the area and three odd facts about the vandalism, and starts a 30 second and 3 minute sand timer.

Players take turns giving the explanation, adding to the previous player's story cooperatively or uncooperatively. The 30 second timer turns when it moves to a new player, the next player must work with the remaining time. Players may only speak when they possess the timer, which may be given to or taken by anyone after at least one sentence. The lawman may interject three times, halting the 30 second timer, to ask a question to aid in their decision. 

Play ends when the 30 second timer runs out or at the end of 3 minutes. The lawman weighs who is guilty and who is free to go.

# Say Those Sweet, Sweet [d6] Words, Baby
```
The world is falling apart around you and you are trying to communicate with your partner over a barely working communication line.
You have 5 texts each. When you want to send a text, roll a d6 and use that many words to convey that message.
What do you wanna use these words for? You can try to find each other, you can try to figure out what's happening, you can try to tell them how much you love them before it's too late. It's your choice.

You have 15 minutes. Set a timer. And start texting.
When the timer is up. You might die or you might find each other. The important question is, are you happy with what you chose to do? Did you say everything you wanted to say?

# A Road None Travel By
```
This is a classic dungeon and you have 6 classes: Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Sorcerer, Bard and Priest. 

You have a changing goal that begins with finding information in town and then moving from there into the dungeon to reach your goal.

But there is a twist, you can not Harm or Kill any enemies you encounter because you are a pacifist and it is a crime against your beliefs to do so. 

So you must use your skills like pickpocket to steal keys or Strength break open doors, Spells like Flash and Levitate to move around Monsters, weapons, Equipment like disguises or a lute to charm others ,and more to find your way around obstacles you encounter. It requires a game master to run the shops and NPCs and choose the objectives of your quest.

All players will start with 500 hundred gold to buys items and choose 3 class spells of their choice.

You can play this game with 2 to 7 players, letting you go on a solo run of this quest or making it a full party raid of the dungeons.

Now let's go on our quest in this Dungeon With a Twist.
