### **This is NOT the submission page.** This page won't save anything, so make sure to back it up somewhere else.

Check the wordcount and formatting of your entry. The box below is a good way to **preview how your entry will look.** Keep in mind that the website will re-size itself depending on the size of the screen being used. For example, [Instant Adventures Generator](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/14/InstantAdventuresGeneratorpocketedition.html) looks great on a very wide screen, but will be squished on a phone.

Entry Requirements:

* **Entries must contain 200 words or fewer.** Any entry with more than 200 words will be rejected. Type your entry into the wordcounter below to make sure it is valid.
* **Entries must be written in the English language.** Entries in other languages will be rejected.
* **No emojii's, no chinese characters, etc.** Only [Basic Latin Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin) are allowed. <br>*Unicode x0000 through x00FF for the nerds out there.*
* **What counts as a word?** You can see more details in the text box below if you like. However if you're just writing plain and simple text, you don't need to worry about any of that stuff. Your words will count just fine.
