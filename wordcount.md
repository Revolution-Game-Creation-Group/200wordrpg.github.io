### **This is NOT the submission page.** 

This page won't save anything, so make sure to back it up somewhere else.

Check the wordcount and formatting of your entry. The box below is a good way to **preview how your entry will look.** Keep in mind that the website will re-size itself depending on the size of the screen being used. For example, [Instant Adventures Generator](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/14/InstantAdventuresGeneratorpocketedition.html) looks great on a very wide screen, but will be squished on a phone.

Entry Requirements:

* **Entries must contain 200 words or fewer.** Any entry with more than 200 words will be rejected. Type your entry into the wordcounter below to make sure it is valid.
* **Entries must be written in the English language.** Entries in other languages will be rejected.
* **No emojii's, no chinese characters, etc.** Only [Basic Latin Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin) are allowed. <br>*Unicode x0000 through x00FF for the nerds out there.*
* **What counts as a word?** The specific word rules are listed in the box below. Delete what's there to check your own wordcount.
