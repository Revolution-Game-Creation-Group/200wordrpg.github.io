This page is a place for you to check the wordcount and formatting of your entry. **It is NOT the submission page.** This page won't save anything, so make sure to back it up somewhere else.

### Text Requirements:

* **Entries must contain 200 words or fewer.** Any entry with more than 200 words will be rejected.
* **No emojii's, no chinese characters, etc.** Only [Extended ASCII characters](http://www.theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-codes.txt) are allowed.
* The box below is a good way to preview how your entry will look. Keep in mind that the website will re-size itself depending on the size of the screen being used. *For example, [Instant Adventures Generator](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2016/supplement/2016/04/14/InstantAdventuresGeneratorpocketedition.html) looks great on a very wide screen, but will be squished on a phone.*
