<h1>. . . Comes Great Responsibility</h1>
<h2>Dylan Ross • https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DylanRoss1</h2>
<code>
  2-4 players, No GM. You each suddenly gain superpowers from an "incident" moments ago. As you discover and learn to use your
  powers, you'll get better. In the meantime, you'll create chaos and consequences. Where did the incident happen? (e.g.
  laboratory, cruise ship, operating room) What was the incident? (e.g. meteor strike, radiation leak, handling artifacts)
  What is your power? (e.g. flight, speed, invisibility, telekinesis) Start the Story: That incident just happened. How do
  you react? Each describe how you accidentally discover your power and what consequence was set in motion as a result. Deal
  with Consequences by Using Your Power: You start at Level 1. Choose when to use your powers, say what you want to do, roll
  d6, and compare to your level. Under = success Equal = success, gain a level Over = add a new consequence, gain a level
  Decide What Happens: All players can suggest consequences, but the player rolling has the final say. Consequences should
  move the story forward, make them more severe at higher levels. End the Game: Once all players reach Level 6, resolve any
  loose ends, and then end the game when everyone agrees there's nothing left to do.

  Players: * Witch; * Demon. Witch, bring 3 headshots. Create a triangle with 6 matches, an ashtray in the centre. Each side
  an Oracle: * Ash: ruin; * Warmth: feelings; * Light: joy. Demon, take the photos. Back: draw an Oracle twice on each. No
  doubles. Front: write: * Name; * Age; * Occupation. Witch, one photo per corner. PHOTO * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  * * ASH WARMTH * * * ASHTRAY * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * PHOTO *************** LIGHT ***************** PHOTO Play 3 scenes.
  Witch and Demon, choose one character each. Witch, frame a scene between them. Everything/everyone else: shared authority.
  Both: * Establish relationships; * Show something personal and important. Demon, introduce a Crisis. Resolve it with the
  Oracle between them. Draw it on both characters. Play 3 more scenes. Witch, now, before Crisis resolution, you can move
  one character to another corner. Resolve the Crisis, for the still character, with the old Oracle; for the moved character,
  with the Oracle on the side between their old and new corner. Draw the Oracles on the photos accordingly. Narrate a different
  finale for each photo, accounting for and starting from the most widely distributed Oracle on each, and burn them. Demon,
  break ties. Say: * Witch: which headshot portrayed you; * Demon: the cost for their powers; * Witch: why you took the deal.
  Burn everything else.

  Inspirations: * The “college triangle”: one side “good grades”, one side “social life”, one side “enough sleep”. Choose two.
  Probably it all started from that. * “Apocalypse World” by D. Vincent Baker (Lumpley Games; 1st edition: 2010; 2nd edition:
  2016). On several moves, on a 7-9, you have to choose one or two over three options. This makes good ground for thematic
  choices. * “A Scoundrel in the Deep” by Renato Ramonda. Published in Epidiah Ravachol (editor), “Swords Without Master”,
  volume 1, issue 6 (November 2014), Dig a Thousand Holes Publishing. You know, a game which makes use of matches and all
  the rest… * “Les Petites Choses Oubliées” by Sylvie Guillaume & Christoph Boeckle (L’Impromptu, 2015). The idea of using
  photos as thematic game material came up from here. * “Walls of Concordia” by Daniele Di Rubbo (Geecko on the Wall, 2017).
  My entry for the Game Chef Pummarola Ediscion 2017 was my first game which makes use of photos as game material (in the
  wake of “Les Petites Choses Oubliées”). I someway reversed the criterion for the choice of the photos from the “no portraits”
  rule to the “only portraits” one. Thanks for proofreading, peer review, and feedback to: * Daniele Fusetto * Alberto Muti
  * Michael Tangherlini * Nicola Urbinati * Francesco Zani Thanks to Francesco Zani for the ASCII character scheme of the

      You'll need players and a Narrator, and a good story. The Narrator will guide the adventure, and decide how many fail it's
      necessary to die. Players describes their characters in a breef paragraph. Start the game by everybody showing a number
      in the hands, at the same time. Divide in two groups, odd and even, whomever is in the same group as the Narrator starts
      unlucky, the others are lucky. When it's lucky, your life is incredible, full of good surprises and wonderful people.
      You'll scape ambushes, scams and enviroment hazards. You'll never get lost. You'll escape every danger. When it's unlucky,
      your life is miserable, full of problems and hateful people. You''ll be victim of all susprise attacks, traps, curses,
      scams and dangers. Everything bad will happen to you first. When you can't decide the result of an action only by narrating
      it, play rock-paper-scissors. Narrates successes and fails accordingly. When you get a draw, it will be a sucess for
      a lucky character and a fail for a unlucky one. After that, change you fortune! Lucky becomes unlucky and vice-versa!
      When a player becomes lucky or unlucky as all the others, everybody else becomes the opposite.

    <code>
      In the ruins of a rainy city, humans hide in the shadows, trying to survive. Why did their world fall? Why are they hiding?
      And what should you - their former robot servants - do now? Player characters are robots, each beginning with two 'Modules'
      which each represent one of the game's stats: Manipulators: ability to physically operate things Drive Power: ability
      to sustain damage and exertion Empathy: ability to feel and understand emotions Subterfuge: ability to tell and detect
      falsehoods Logic: ability to reason and persuade Information Processing: ability to sense, understand and remember
      Rolls are made with D8s. The GM sets a target number from 1 to 8 (low for easy, high for hard). At least one die matching
      or beating the target indicates success. Robots with no modules relevant to the task roll D8. Robots with a relevant
      module roll 2D8. The GM should reward players who roleplay using their modules (or the lack of them) with an extra
      D8. Robots can find and install additional modules during the game (often as a reward for achieving tasks). A robot
      which takes damage loses a module. A robot with no modules is, in a manner of speaking, dead...

      player may either concede, thus failing automatically but simultaneously losing 1 point in that Characteristic and
      gaining 1 point of Redemption. Or they can roll a d8. Rolling a 1 or below their Characteristic score gives a critical

      You are creating a world together. One where people live, go to work, and maybe something out of the ordinary happens. It
      can be as mundane, or as fantastical, as you desire. This is a game for 2-5 players. You could push five, however you
      may find that too hectic. To begin, go around in a circle. Have each player define something about your world. It can
      be anything from the style of structures, to the type of food people eat, or the way people interact. Whoever defined
      that trait now has ownership over that aspect of the world. Each player also creates a character and loosely defines
      how they interact with the world. Begin with the last person to define something about the city and once again go in
      a circle. They will begin to narrate a typical day for their character. Other players can help out with conversations
      they have thought the day. When they encounter something that another player owns the aspect of, they can stop you
      and complicate your day. Then the person who is narrating explains how their character would navigate and overcome

      one of your friends that you would not say to their face. The secrets you reveal should be complimentary to the recipient,
      but may make you uncomfortable or embarrassed. Be specific, but do not address your friends by name. The first secret
      should be whispered and barely audible. Each subsequent secret should be louder than the last, until everyone is shouting
      secrets into the darkness. If you haven't spoken for about a minute, and you can't think of something sincerely nice
      to say, say something embarrassing about yourself instead. It's nicer to be nice. The game ends when someone not playing

      eye contact with the seeker and the seeker cannot see the hiding player's entire body-- covering your eyes behind a
      chair is a legal hiding place. The seeker counts while barely covering their eyes. The count is to 10, or higher, depending
      how long it takes a hiding player to find a hiding place. Those hiding usually giggle or make noises while the seeker
      loudly proclaims where they are looking. The seeker will look in places closer and closer to a hiding player, knocking
      on objects and saying, "where is [hiding player's name]? Are they [place they are looking]?" Then, the seeker loudly

      life on the planet? What music is playing in this shuttle, and why? Are you human? What's that incongruous item in
      your will? How can you laugh at a time like this? What will the people back home think about this? Is your orbit stable?
      Are there other, greater forces at work? What's the atmosphere down there like? What animal did you smuggle onto the
      shuttle? Where did you board the shuttle? What's this graffiti say? What's this planet's sun like? What will you miss?
      When the timer runs out the person who is currently talking finishes their sentence, then the next person describes
      the shuttle's demise, based on what has already come to light.

    <h1>A Mingling of Awareness</h1>
    <h2>Nora Blake • twitter.com/NeitherNora</h2>
    <code>
      Boko-maru: the supreme act of worship of the Bokononists, which is an intimate act consisting of prolonged contact between
      the naked soles of the feet of two persons. It is said to be the "mingling of awareness." When playing this game, sit
      on the floor. Bare your feet, and be sure you have washed yourself. Together you will be telling the story of a lone
      traveler seeking enlightenment. Touch your soles to the other player's. Set a scene, then ask them a question. They
      will answer it, then continue the scene and ask a new question. When choosing a question to ask, consider the feel
      and character of the other player's feet. How do they move? Are they timid, or comfortable? Rough, or soft? Do you
      feel invited or rebuffed? How alike are their feet to those of the traveller? Here are some example questions: How
      do they react to that? When do they get there? How long does that take? Who sees that? How does that go wrong? Play
      ends when one of you is asked a question you don't want to answer, or one of you retracts your foot.

    <h1>A Perilous Journey... with raptors</h1>

    <code>
      Each year when young Raptorkin come of age they journey from their sweltering jungle village to the volcanic ice-peaks of
      Dragon's Maw, bringing back shards of purest obsidian to prove themselves. Everyone plays as one adolescent Raptorkin:
      - Rek'Na, teethmonger's daughter. - Oosa, albino acolyte. - N'nek, feathered crest. - Raaljin, knife-dancer's son.
      - Latu, feral child. - Orn and Ira, twins. - Yatt, iron-scaled giant. The group begins with 2 Supplies per player.
      Every Raptorkin begins with 6 Morale. Everyone takes 3 index cards. Name a dangerous or beautiful location on each.
      Shuffle them together then line them up, face down. Add the Raptorkin's Village and Dragon's Maw, face up, to opposite
      ends of the line. Begin at the village. Discus what happens at each location. When everyone is ready to move on, flip
      the next card and continue your journey. When a Raptorkin takes dramatic or dangerous action roll 1d10 vs their Morale.
      - Roll lower: Success! - Roll equal: Success, and gain 1 Morale. - Roll higher: The group decides how the situation
      gets worse, or, they succeed but it costs 1 Morale or Supplies. If a Raptorkin's Morale hits zero, they reset to 6
      Morale but now bear a secret shame. What is it?

      Monarch, Professor, etc.) What do they look like? Answer the following together: The duelists were once very close,
      but something has compelled them to fight. What was it? (an unforgivable deed, an outside force, a regretful responsibility,
      etc.) What weapons are being used in this duel? (ancient swords, beautiful songs, forgotten curses, etc.) Assign one
      side of the coin to each of the duelists. Flip the coin. If your side is face up, describe how your duelist used their
      weapon to harm the other. If your side is face down, recount a happy memory that both duelists shared. Flip the coin
      and repeat. The player who wins three coin tosses describes what becomes of the defeated duelist. The other player

      A tiny person is hiding under a paper cup. This cup is mixed in among many other paper cups, all upside down. This person
      is purely imaginary, a conceit of the game-they are not real and are not represented by a player. The players want
      to find the tiny person, for whatever reason. As the players play, they will talk to each other and to the little hiding
      person, discovering the setting and who they are as they play. The players will begin by trying to entice the tiny
      person out with words, then gently lifting the cups one at a time. The players will become angrier as each cup is revealed
      to be empty. Eventually they will start swatting cups off the table, then smashing them. All of these will prove to
      be empty too. Eventually one cup will be left. The players know that this cup conceals the tiny person-it is a certainy.
      Pause a moment, let anyone speak who wants to speak, but someone must smash the cup. Clean up the play area, but leave
      that last smashed cup untouched. Do not look underneath. The game is over.

    <h1>Abyssal Zone</h1>
    <h2>Luther Gutekunst • https://archons-court.blogspot.com/</h2>
    <code>
      In Abyssal Zone, each player is captain of a submarine, going into the Abyss to find relics. When you start, each player
      draws 5 playing cards. The suit of each card is its module on your submarine. Clubs = Weapons Hearts = Life Support
      Diamonds = Armor Spades = Propulsion The game works in 5-round increments. To start, each player chooses a card, says
      how it could delay another player, rolls 1d6 + the card's number, (Aces are 1, face cards are 10) and discards the
      card. After that, each player chooses a card, says how it could protect them, rolls 1d6 + the card's number, and discards
      the card. If that number is lower than the attacker's, the defender has a -1 penalty in the 3rd round. This cycle repeats
      in the 2nd round. In the 3rd round, each player attempts to defeat the relic's Challenge (automaton guards, forcefield,
      etc.). To defeat the challenge, everyone chooses a card and rolls 2d6 + the card's number. The highest result gets
      the relic. The last 2 rounds function identically to the first two, but if the defender has the relic and gets a lower
      number, the relic goes to the attacker.

      You are a seaplane pilot in the Adriatic. The year is 1922 and the taverna you frequent is rapt as you tell tall tales of
      derring-do; fighting sky pirates, finding treasure etc. For each pilot add six, six-sided dice to the Audience pool.
      One Pilot starts telling their tale of heroism. Tally the acts of heroism you describe, roll one Audience dice for
      each. 1's leave, unimpressed by your bluster, remove the dice from the game. 6's, impressed by your tale, buy you a
      drink. You keep the dice. Next the other pilots may each ask one question. If you cannot answer, or if all the other
      pilots agree you didn't answer properly, give the questioning pilot one of your drinks, if you have one. The pilot
      to your left takes the story and explains how they are the real hero, continuing the tale, or may pass. Once there
      are no dice left in the audience or all Pilots pass in a round, the night ends. The following morning roll and add
      all of your drinks. Whoever gets closest to 17 without going over had the most merry evening. Everyone shakes hands.

    <h1>After Man</h1>
    <h2>Jim Odebralski</h2>
    <code>
      After Man It is an unknown time after humans have destroyed themselves. Animals have evolved and started their own civilizations.
      The rodents have evolved the fastest. Thus, the character races are mice, rats, racoon, rabbits, and so on. Squirrels
      are the most advanced and have sprawling tree cities. They adventure in the ruins of the ancients (human cities). Other
      animals evolved into more vicious predators. Think D&D with different rodent races. The grey squirrels are the most
      abundant and common of the hero races. While the mice are the most abundant of the evil races, think of them as the
      goblin and rats as the orc. Human descendants in After Man are giant (compared to our heroes) mutated monstrosities.
      They inhabit the vast overgrown ruins of an ancient time. But these ruins are also a place of wonderous treasures.
      Just as the ape and man share the same ancestry, the rodents diverged as well. Meaning some just became larger versions
      of their old self. These are used for labor and mounts for the military of the squirrel kingdoms. The ability of rodents
      to climb most natural surfaces has led to alternative forms of combat and weapon designs.

      The sun has died. The world will soon follow. Chaos is rife, time is short and business is unfinished. The game requires
      3 or 4 players and a six-sided die. The players each play a member of a nuclear family, each with dark, unfinished
      business in their past that needs to be resolved before it's too late. Perhaps they seek revenge in a world free of
      consequences? Or absolution before the end? Discuss tone and triggers as a group before play. Use an X card. Take turns
      around the table to frame a scene which establishes your unfinished business - highlight an important moment that lends
      gravitas to the situation. When it's your turn you play your character. The other players play their character or an
      NPC (depending on the scene). Then everyone takes a turn framing a scene where we see the unfinished business being
      addressed. Right before the resolution, roll 1d6. 1: Death 2-3: Fail catastrophically 4-5: Succeed with a consequence
      6: Succeed Interpret your result and roleplay out the end of your scene. Once all players have framed their two scenes,
      each player gets to contribute one phrase describing how the world ends.

    <code>
      This is a very frustrating game for crazy-loud people and people who write really quickly! Materials: Paper, pens, outside
      voices The quietest person or the best listener is the Air Traffic Controller. (You can also take turns, if you like.)
      Everybody else is a Pilot. Set a timer for sixty seconds. Now, the Pilots write down as many flight times, weather
      hazards, delays, cancellations, etc. as they can think of. When the timer goes off, stop. Next, set a timer for three
      minutes. During this time, the Pilots SHOUT everything they wrote at the Air Traffic Controller. The Air Traffic Controller
      writes down as much as they can hear on their paper. When the timer goes off, stop. The Air Traffic Controller reads
      everything they wrote. The Pilots mark all of the data that the Air Traffic Controller got right. The Pilots take turns
      making up stories about the problems that occured. What happened to that flight to Nashville that got delayed four
      hours? Were the Beatles on that plane? Did they miss their own concert? Endgame Scoring: Tally up the number of correct
      data points that each Pilot communicated. The Pilot who correctly communicated the most is the winner!

      story from their life. Couple of words about a daunting first love or an unsettled quarrel. Maybe something about one's
      mother. If one remember having a mother, of course. Use one as a theme: apathy, isolation, asexuality, strangeness,
      restraint, compulsion. While speaking, one shall be asked one question by the others. That's the rest trying to figure
      out if one's human or not. "What have you felt, then?" is a good one. "Why haven't you felt anything, then?" is even
      better. If you're satisfied with their answer, give them +1. If not, give them -1. When everyone's finished, vote for
      least humane story. Then you take the revolver and you kill its teller, that bastard. Hope you made a good decision.
      Roll d6, modifiers apply. On 3 or less, you killed the odd one. On 4 or more, you killed a human - so you vote and
      kill again, and again until you know the truth.

    <h1>Alternate Timeline Life</h1>
    <h2>Justin Gilman • http://eyeofmidas.com</h2>
    <code>
      You start as yourself, in your current timeline, living your current life. You get to make one decision every hour and your
      goal is to reshape the world to be better. You will live for 32d4 - your current age. For a 25-year old person this
      is about 475k moves before the game ends. You can influence people immediately adjacent to you. You have a set of stats
      you can influence by 1 per person: lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy and pride. As these stats increase or
      decrease per person, they will change their attitude toward you and may work towards your goals or against them. Once
      these stats reach +/- 25 this person is considered in your immediate influence. People immediately adjacent to you
      can take an action an hour similar to you. Also, people who are in your immediate influence can also take an action
      an hour. The action taken will be "in character" for that person. On your turn you can move towards another person
      so your set of adjacent people change. Moves can be blocked by other players or people. What are the least number of
      moves to make the biggest positive change?
    </code>
    <p>
      This was meant as a way to approach the feeling of helplessness that we all feel in our lives; whether personal problems,
      or local issues, or even the political climate. Playing this game will make you think of ways to influence those around
      you in a way to both maximize your reach and help improve the world. It also implies that, even with a seemingly unlimited
      number of moves, you can easily waste them on stupid vices. The RPG elements are inherent in our real lives; adjacent
      people can be friends or family, or even people on the internet reading silly game designs that get affected by what
      you write. I hope you enjoyed thinking about this!

      The year is 2334 and there are hundreds of officially recognized genders, and new genders are being launched every year.
      Gender isn't about who you date, but how others recognize and encourage you. The players are a group of friends trying
      to launch a new gender. Lots of folks from their hometown identify as this gender, and now they're trying to launch
      it nationally. They must compete with teams from around the country in the reality TV show _America's Got Gender_.
      After each episode, viewers can pledge to switch to a gender from the show. The winning gender needs 500,000 pledges.
      Events may include a fashion show, a poetry slam, dance-off, martial arts competition, a cooking match, a discussion/debate.
      It isn't about winning, but showcasing your gender's norms. Players co-create the norms as they go. Between each event,
      players play a round of a cooperative board game like _Pandemic_ or _Hanabi_. How they did in the game is an indicator
      of how viewers responded to that week's episode. If they if they win the board game, their gender gets launched! It'll
      be federally recognized, and hecka clubs will host celebrations for those coming out as the gender!

    <code>
      Player Characters (PCs) wake up with amnesia. An Evil Mastermind (EM) has captured them, and will test them against dangerous
      challenges, deadly traps, and hard choices in a life-or-death game. PCs begin with two Protagonist Points and one memory
      - "My name is ______". Write this down. When challenged, PCs roll a d6. 6 = Success, recover a memory. 4-5 = Success.
      2-3 = Failure, suffer an injury. 1 = Failure, lose a memory. If one PC is challenging another, the challenger rolls.
      Define what "success" and "failure" mean before the roll. Any player can spend a Protagonist Point to re-roll any die
      once, including forcing other players to reroll. PCs are awarded Protagonist Points after betraying another PC, causing
      them to suffer an injury or lose a memory. When a PC recovers a memory, they write down the memory. When a PC loses
      a memory, they cross it out. When a PC has no memories left, they die. When a PC has suffered 5 physical injuries,
      they die. When a PC has regained 5 memories, they will remember how to escape the deathtrap. They must succeed at one
      final challenge to escape...but what kind of person have they become?

      your cards or take two of theirs, incorporating your choice in your scene. If no one has two or more cards, there's

    <h1>An Incomplete Entity</h1>
    <h2>Z Gosck • zgosck.com</h2>
    <code>
      A role-playing game of self-discovery for GM and 1 or more players. Entity: noun, a thing with distinct and independent existence.
      Start with a blank sheet of paper, this is your character. You are an incomplete entity, a thing of undefined values.
      Values define what you are, and what you are not. Values are divided into Attributes (general traits) and Skills (specific
      abilities). If an attribute is required, roll 3d10, taking the middle result. If a skill is required, roll 1d10 to
      determine. Write all values on your character sheet. Values can be defined only when relevant to the situation, and
      once defined become a part of what you are. There is no set list or number of attributes or skills. When failure is
      possible, roll 1d0 adding an attribute and skill (or just attribute if no skill is relevant). Outcomes: under 10: Failure,
      10 or higher: Success, 20 or higher: Exceptional, 30: perfect Alternatively, outcomes can be determined by GM based
      solely on values without rolling. Through experience you gain values, through values you gain identity, with identity
      you gain existence. Continue play until you are a complete entity, a thing of identity and existence.

    <h1>An Uneasy Council</h1>
    <h2>Ben Wray</h2>
    <code>
      Each player comes up with 4 spells on index cards. The GM chooses a number, equal to the number of players, for the Antagonist,
      shuffle the rest. Deal 1 to each player, that PC alone knows that spell. Deal 1 more for each player, everyone BUT
      that PC knows that spell (including the Antagonist). Reveal the rest, each player receives 100 points to bid on them.
      After bidding, each player notes down how many players have fewer points than them, plus one: this is how many spells
      they can prepare at any given time. Each player names their character and answers the following questions: -How can
      anyone observing you instantly tell you are a wizard? -Why have you sworn vengeance against the Antagonist? -Why are
      the other wizards wise not to trust you completely? When accomplishing things, magic always works, although you can
      only cast each spell once before you must prepare it again at your library. When using mundane effort, there's a 50%
      chance of success, unless the GM rules that is too high (the action simply fails) or too low (it succeeds). Play begins
      with the wizards gathered in uneasy council to discuss the problem of the Antagonist.

    <code>
      You're kids (teenagers, coworkers...) out for a playdate (movie, pizza...). Each player chooses a Target player and secretly
      writes two commonly used words (called "Triggers"): "yes", "sure", "but", "okay", "still"... If they know the Target's
      player enough, they can write a word the Target specifically uses very often. Now they explain their relationship to
      everyone else: "friends since forever", "still getting to know you" and so on. A player tells something about themselves
      (a funny thing they did/saw, a little gossip...), then asks another player something ("What about you?" is fine). Continue
      until everyone has spoken, then repeat. Whenever your target speaks a Trigger, stop them. You noticed a suspicious
      detail in them: what? (e.g. "Is that blood?"). The target can find an Explanation for the detail, like "Accidental
      cut" (you secretly write +1 Trigger), or deny it with an Excuse, like "Oh, just ketchup" (you write +2). When someone
      reaches 3 Explanations/Excuses, they must reveal their horrifying secret (invent it now; make it coherent with all
      accepted details). They then secretly write 2 Triggers with "everyone else" as a target. The game ends when everyone's
      secrets are in the open (the last revelation is optional).

<h1>And They'll Hear You When It 's Done</h1>
<h2>Aleks Samoylov • twitter.com/aleks_S</h2>
<code>
You're an obscure band on a very important cross-country tour. This is your shot. Unfortunately, you 're all quite thoroughly cursed. 

Each player invents a backstory and selects 2 curses:

Pain - Everything hurts.
Fear - Everything is terrifying. 
Gab - Must keep talking. 
Honesty - Can't lie. Speed - Must keep moving. Curse counters start at 2. When a musician does something important or stressful,
          roll 1d6. If the roll is equal to or under their highest curse counter, they stumble: increment either curse by 1
          point. If a curse is at 3 or higher, it flares whenever the musician stumbles. When it reaches 6, it remains in effect
          until dropped to 3. To drop a curse counter, a musician can cope or remember. Frame a scene and roll. If they don
          't stumble, subtract 1 from either curse. Alternatively, they can seek comfort: another musician rolls instead. 

Each player defines the nature and location of at least 1 gig on the tour. Hold a band meeting after a gig is defined. The last, most important gig is defined collaboratively (everyone adds at least 1 detail). Every gig presents each musician with a major task or challenge. Take turns framing scenes until the tour ends.

Almost everything I make is a loose, imperfect metaphor for mental illness. This is an attempt to give my morose preoccupation a fun (more so than usual, at least), community-focused spin.

<h1>And... Action!</h1>
<h2>Eric Jome</h2>

No holds barred.  Clues unearthed.  A tense standoff.  A passionate embrace.  The murderer accused.  A high speed chase.  The stuff of which dreams are made.  Scene by scene you build to a resolution and... Action!

Each player is given 3d6 and a supply of index cards on which to write.  Roll to see who will be the first Director.

The game is played in rounds.  Each round, The Director describes a scene, and then chooses two other players as Protagonist and Antagonist.  The Protagonist writes out at least 2 cards using only nouns describing a person with a goal in the scene.  The Antagonist writes out at least 2 cards using only nouns describing an obstacle to the character's goal in the scene. The Antagonist and Protagonist each roll their remaining dice. The player with the highest
          total describes the resolution of the scene, then selects 2 cards to use in setting the next scene, in which they
          will be the new Director. The player with the lower total sets aside one of their dice. The story ends when one player
          is out of dice. The player with the highest total set aside describes the conclusion. </code>

            each match (J matched with 5 + 4 = 2; J matched with Q = 1) [R]. Roll d12. If equal or higher than [R], patient
            is healed, flip 1 [SC]. Otherwise... patient dies, flip one [KC]; Apothecary loses hope - describe his struggle.
            When last [KC] is flipped, Apothecary gives up and plague wipes out the town. If Apothecary cures a patient when
            all [SC] are flipped, he finds the cure. Shuffle all [MC] and [PC] into the deck. Give apothecary 10 - [KC] flipped
            cards. Begin new turn.

            My major goal for this project was to create a game mechanic that would suddenly throw the player off guard and start question
            her chances of winning. First turns, when the plague seems just like a simple sickness will rarely prove to be
            a trouble. Tables turn very quickly though and the plague soon starts to look like an impossible to overcome
            challenge exactly at the moment when the player may think the victory is at hand.

            skill am I currently using? Did my player roll well or not? Do you feel they played out your actions, or did
            they skip ahead? In the evening, take a couple of minutes to write down the day you had - from the perspective
            of your player. Ask yourself why they made the choices they did - how do they want to develop you? The best roll
            they had - like when they had you write a 200-word-RPG and rolled really well on their performance check. Vice
            versa, their worst roll. What class and archetype are you? Did you level up? And is this still backstory, or
            the adventure proper? For a multiplayer experience, share these entries with your friends and discuss the dynamic
            of the group that plays you. Try to find out what their game master is like from what they throw at you. The

          <code>
            1. Frame a scene in which the other players have offered you something enjoyable, but you will need assistance or accommodation
            to accept. Examples: You are invited to dinner, but you need to make sure the meal won't include ingredients
            you can't eat. You are asked to join a BBQ party, but you can't afford a safe way to get there. You've received
            a helicopter ride voucher as a birthday present, and you need to make sure your physical needs are met. You're
            offered a chance to speak at a local event, but you need help with childcare arrangements. 2. Ask the other players
            to accommodate your needs. Other players must try to accommodate you, and discuss options. Be respectful. Try
            to understand the need. Work out a solution together. 3. Move to the next player's turn. Keep your characters'
            specifics from previous scenes. Just remember which character's needs are in the spotlight of the current scene.
            4. Once every player has a short scene, reflect together: Did you each get what you needed? If not, why not?
            Did you apologize for anything? Were you defensive? Did you need explanations? How did you feel?

            mechanics: The value in front of the roll represents your sanity. During your stay, said sanity will be put to
            the test, either by the environment itself, or the crazed behaviors of the poor souls that keep you company.
            If you come across something horrendous, something that can go from a strange moan in a language you don't understand
            out of a dead end, to someone gouging his/her own eyes, roll a d4. The result will reduce your sanity. Your role
            may help you in some cases, be it by your years of experience or your knowledge of treatments and medicine. Make
            these calls, and if the Caretaker agrees, roll a d4 against the sanity penalty. If this roll is higher than the
            previous one, you regain the difference. If your sanity reaches 0, you collapse and the Caretaker decides what

                Discuss the setting. Medieval Europe? Fantasy? Western? Space opera? Stretch the definition of "family".
                Don't add too much detail. Open the chess game and fast-forward 15 moves. What does the board look like?
                Think of characters that represent each piece. Who is missing? Who is powerful? Who is in danger? Flesh out
                the story up until now. Each player chooses a side to control. Black or White. You are not competing. Play
                out the remainder of the game using the historic record. One move at a time. For each move, what has changed
                in the story? What is that character doing? Who is opposed? Is a grand sacrifice in the works? The controlling
                player narrates what that means in the fiction, as descriptively as she likes. The other player adds details.
                Collaborate. Go back and forth until the chess game ends. Who won? Was it a draw? What does that mean for
                the fiction? Together create an epilogue.

                Ecphoneme is an obsolete word for "Exclamation Mark," used entirely because of the 45 character limit on titles. The "Clipped

                of any mafia game would come up with elaborate stories as to how the victim of each round died, or tried
                to catch the mafia. i thought i'd write a mafia "hack" that had that sort of storytelling built in, and allowed
                the players to make characters for themselves!

                A group of barbarians have become trapped in a mall and find themselves forced to adapt to a new way of life. Anytime the
                barbarians attempt to exit the mall, they find themselves instead in a small apartment with no windows, an
                uncomfortable bed, a cramped bathroom, and a door back into the mall. You are those barbarians and must live
                your life in the day to day hell known as suburban shopping. Barbarians have two skills, Brain and Brawns.
                They are good at one and mildly disappointing at the other. Choose which skill your barbarian is good at.
                When you make a skill check for your "good" skill, roll 2d6 and use whichever result you want. For your "bad"
                skill, roll 1d6 instead. When you roll a: 1 or 2 - YOU FAIL! 3 or 4 - The GM also rolls 1d6 if they roll
                the same or higher than your roll, you fail but gain a small advantage if they roll lower than you, you succeed
                but suffer a small setback 5 or 6 - You succeed

                You are barbarians! Raid enemy holdings for the glory of your clan. -Characters- Describe your character. The GM uses the
                description to determine your strengths and weaknesses. Strengths subtract a level of difficulty for checks
                that involve them, weaknesses add a level. As barbarians, you each start with a bone mace(-1 attack difficulty)
                and natural toughness(+1 opponent attack difficulty). Additional items may be acquired throughout play. -Difficulty-
                The GM determines the difficulty of an action. Difficulty ranges from effortless(-3) to arduous(+3). Outside
                this range automatically succeeds or fails. Average(0) is a d6 roll. For each difficulty-level outside average,
                roll another d6. Above normal, take the lowest. Below normal, take the highest. Rolls succeed on 4 or higher.
                -Combat- Each turn you can attack and move up to 30'. Target a body-part at +1 difficulty or select randomly,
                then roll to hit. 2d6 2.......Head 3-4.....Left-Leg 5.......Left-Arm 6-8.....Torso 9.......Right-Arm 10-11...Right-Leg
                12......Head Body-parts become mutilated at 4 injuries. Each injury adds difficulty for that body-part (-5'
                movement for legs). When the torso or head are mutilated, you are slain. A body-part suffers two injuries
                on a 6.

                off the mind-forged manacles of industrial society and steal Byron's heart. One player is the George Gordon
                Master (GGM). They describe the earth, the mien of its inhabitants, and call for checks when the story demands.
                For checks, roll 2d10. If skilled in the task, put the lowest number first; if unskilled, put the highest
                first. The other dice goes second. If this value is no higher than your ENLIGHTENMENT, the check succeeds.
                The GGM calls for a SUBLIME check when you encounter an awesome natural sight or when you roll doubles. Failing
                a SUBLIME check lowers your ENLIGHTENMENT score by 1d10. If the GGM is especially struck by the brilliance
                of your description, they may invite a SUBLIME check. BUT WHERE TO GO? (2d10 and combine)-a peak; a crevasse;
                a forest; a desert; a cliff; a storm; the sunrise; an hive; a stampede; a waterfall. WHAT WILL VEX US? (3d10,
                in order)-distance; expense; secrecy; peril; rivalry; intoxication; distraction; syphilis; commitments; scandal.

                ###### Setup: Grab three hot-sauces. Make sure that these are real hot, and order from least to most spicy. One person GMs,
                everyone else plays a character. Pretty standard stuff. ###### Character Creation: Write your character down,
                and allocate one of the hot-sauces to each of the following stats (your best stat will have the least spicy):
                Physical. Anything that uses your body. Mental. Your ability to debate, lie, problem solve, etc. Spiritual.
                Your willpower (it's kinda like wisdom meets constitution). *(Note to GM: If you're unsure which skill applies
                in a situation, it's probably Spiritual)* ###### Conflict Resolution: When you want to do something, the
                GM will determine how many spoons of sauce you must do (based on the difficulty). You must IRL do that many
                tablespoons of the sauce listed under the stat to succeed. If the conflict is between two players, go back-and-forth
                until someone gives up. ###### Health and Damage: Everything deals equal damage. When you get hurt, do three
                spoons of your Spiritual sauce. You have one glass of milk, you are NOT allowed to refill it. You don't die
                when it runs out; you die when you can't handle it anymore.

              <code>
                A low stakes game for two players. Each makes a realistic character who might know the other. Franklin believed we can improve
                ourselves by focusing on a single virtue each week: Temperance Silence Order Resolution Frugality Industry
                Sincerity Justice Moderation Cleanliness Tranquillity Chastity Humility Each week has a goal- family, social,
                professional/school, spiritual, hobby, rest. Roll 1d6 or choose and narrate your character's life. Each week
                choose one virtue- not necessarily from above- and try to improve your life along that axis despite life's
                challenges. Each week roll 1d6- 6 means you crush it, you narrate how something challenged you and you didn't
                give in. Five or four means the other person, playing the world, narrates a problem and you narrate the solution.
                Otherwise they narrate a problem and you narrate how you failed. Start with 1 point, each rolled success
                adds one, failures can be cancelled if you can tie the virtue you previously earned into reaching new goals.
                Cancelling 3s costs 1 point, cancelling 2s costs 2, cancelling 1s costs 3. Switch roles each week so both
                players get thirteen virtues. Once done you may start over because nobody alive is perfect.

              <p>
                So many games are about being powerful and destined and all of that, and I wanted to try a ruleset about something more achievable
                like the actual historical Benjamin Franklin’s advice on how to improve your life, or as he called it in
                his autobiography "A bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection." These virtues are not a perfect
                list for a modern audience (I didn’t even add ‘delete twitter’) but I think there’s still some value in using
                Franklin’s own thirteen virtues as a starting place. After all, he got things done. This game is descended
                from 14 Days by the company Make Big Things, an exercise in managing expectations against the randomness
                of chronic illness. I’d have loved to include more rules about ways to tie in narratives, add long term goals,
                references to illness and breakups and all sorts of little things that make up life but luckily I’m limited
                to two hundred words and there’s no space for overthinking.

                first game's chat (flirting?). Who are you? What do you like? Not like? When you feel like it's time, the

                where things were headed after the first game, so take that into account. After the second game (another

                the second question's answer? If so, the game's done. If not, or if you're tied, play another game/round,
                choosing who takes which role. Either way, talk about the date and what happens next.

                Setting: Cyber-70s. Reel-to-reel data centers in downtown, government component manufacturers, trucks carrying the bank's
                back-up tapes to cold storage, antique technology dealers, all possible targets. Players are robot criminals.
                They have a skill, a negative trait, and a name. Mechanics: -Players get 5 quarters (coins). -Players flip
                quarters to perform checks. -Binary. Heads = 1. Tails = 0. Example: | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | | 1 | 0 | 1 |
                0 | 1 | -Players can flip as many of their coins as they want. -If above check, success. If exact number,
                critical success. -If below check, failure. If all coins flipped, critical failure, lose a quarter. -Quarters
                can be traded, wagered, or stolen in-game. Session: Characters meet each other before the heist, introduce
                themselves, and create a plan. During this phase, the GM plays the role of a Kingpin. The players form the
                plan by asking the Kingpin questions about the mark, to which the GM responds honestly. Players should have
                a comprehensive plan, and perform checks to acquire the equipment their plan requires. Before the heist begins,
                the GM chooses 3 details of the plan and performs checks to see how accurate they are. The heist begins when
                all players agree they are ready.

                Barbarians have invaded from the North! The Black Iron Brigade gathers to push back the invaders to the mountain pass from
                whence they came. One player is a Traitor, determined by card draw (if Joker). Each player: - Commands a
                unit of cavalry, archers, swordsmen or spearmen ---- Give a name, short description to the unit's origins
                (race, culture, etc). - Starts with one Artifact of Trust, preferably a real item ==========================================================================================
                Five Encounter Cards are placed face-down, representing the path to the main barbarian host. Encounter types
                are: Hearts: Villages. Describe your passage. Spades: Battles. Suggest a strategy. Clubs: Crossings. Suggest
                a way to cross. Diamonds: Uneventful. Share campfire stories. Players vote for best story every encounter;
                winner earns an Artifact from a pile. Also, players can give Artifacts to other players whose stories they
                liked; describe the Artifacts and why you give them. ==========================================================================================
                The Traitor reveals themselves on the last Encounter. Players who have not given their Artifacts away lose
                them. Traitor rolls d6, describes their resentment towards one player, who also rolls a d6. Losers lose an
                Artifact. Continue until each player has been fought. The side with more Artifacts left wins and narrates
                the climax and outcome of the war.

                A tentative novel idea turned RPG. I think the way it's set up organically rewards the people who tell the best stories,
                but also keeps people on their toes--they don't want to reward the traitor, but there's a penalty for keeping
                your artifacts to yourself.

                Requires a set of Hanafuda cards Everyone in attendance is a high ranking samurai in the service of an ambitious lord. You
                have gathered for a cherry blossom viewing party, to drink wine, compose poetry and cement a conspiracy to
                overthrow the government. Assign five points to yourself in two categories: Civility and Savagery. Deal all
                the cards to all players face down. A player who receives a kiri is a Shogunate spy. Return the cards, shuffle
                and deal four cards to each player. The party begins. When a player takes an action against another player,
                compare values in the appropriate category, the higher result achieves their goal. NPC's are improvised by
                the player to your left. You may spend cards on an action. Add one point per card, or double your Savagery
                value if you play an animal, Civility if you play a ribbon. Draw back to four after you are done. If at any
                point you have completed a full seasonal set, you may spend it to ask any player a question which they must
                answer honestly. Cryptic answers are best. The conspirators win if they unmask and kill all spies. Any other
                result is a Shogunate win.

                and circumstances. Filling the Bowls: 1. Flip through the magazines and books, cutting resonant words and
                phrases from them. 2. Collect slips until the bottom of the container (the "Bowl") is blanketed in creative
                potential. Building the Burrows: 3. With the filled Bowl, go to a public place by yourself or with an accomplice.
                This place should have other potential players there. 4. Once an accomplice is available, begin by each picking
                a slip from the Bowl. If no accomplice is available, find one among the rabble. 5. The first slip is the
                Character to be played. Each player introduces themselves in character. 6. Each draws another slip ("the
                Burrow") which describes their relationship to the other. 7. The player with the most obtuse slip starts
                by acting out the Burrow. The other can jump in at any time, evoking their own Burrow. 8. Players continue
                until their interaction starts to feel like a narrative, at which time they must either Bowl (draw another
                slip) or Burrow (invite another player) 9. The cycle starts anew. 10. Once done, assemble the used slips

<h1>Bronze Temple: The Game of Pyrrhic Attrition</h1>
<h2>RoosterCastille • http://social.heckin.tech/rc</h2>
<code>
The Empire is invading and violating the holy sanctity of the worship at the Bronze Temple. The characters, or Defenders, might not be of the faithful - they may be foreign allies - but they definitely all need the Empire's conquest of the known world to be slowed or stopped. 

PLAYERS: 3-6. One person is the GAME MASTER.

A CHALLENGE is a whole scene of CONFLICT, represented by one ROLL, always a D10. Every CHALLENGE is either to a single character's HUMANITY, or RATIONALITY, which is an attribute rated between 2 and 8; a character begins play with 10 points to split into these. On a loss, the character loses a point, or the STAKES, or a TAG. 

STAKES are a narrative resource, described by the GM as the reason for standing and defending at a particular battle. 

TAGS are Values, Possessions, and Relationships held by a character, who starts with 10. These illustrate the identity of the character, and a note card kept by the Player should have a descriptive sentence attaching personal meaning to each. 

CONFLICT scenes alternate with REST scenes in which the next STAKES are chosen.

  |_____________________________________|
  | 3      |Assertiveness |Rebellion    |

Everybody answers:

What's TB about? Army, college, sport, religion, politics...

Why does TD want to belong to TB?

 _________________________________________________________
|      |         |  ...TB require members to do?          |
|      | ...does |________________________________________|  
| What |         |  ...make TD uncomfortable about TB?    |
|      |__________________________________________________|  
|      | ...secret would get him banished?                |
 _________________________________________________________


TD acts upon his virtues. Otherwise, he risks banishment.

TB player: use the answers to frame 4 scenes.
Look for conflict; then ask: "What do you do? "

TD players: narrate together what TD does/thinks/says. 
Resolve a conflict: use either your virtue or vice.

Roll 1d4:

    you win, 
        1-and you hide your vice if used.
        2-but you expose vices if used. Take 1-token for each.
    
    you lose, 
        3-and you fail your virtues. Take 3-tokens.
        4-but you can blame someone else. Discard 3-tokens if you do, or take 3.

Narrate the outcome together.

End of game with 4+ tokens: you're banished; otherwise you retain your position. You can discard all your tokens, but another dude is banished instead of you. 

TB narrates consequences.

On your turn, move exactly as many spaces as your health to a new space, no sharing spaces. End your turn as the only player adjacent to your loved trash, add one purpose 'o'. End on a space adjacent to your hated trash, scratch off one purpose. If both apply, nothing changes.

You may fight any bug in an adjacent space once per turn. When fighting, both players reduce health by one. If you go below one health, you die. There are no winners in combat, only survivors.

Collect ten purpose, you reproduce and die. With your purpose fulfilled, the game ends. You "win.

<h1>Bullshit Tour Guide</h1>
<h2>Ray Visser • rayvisser.itch.io</h2>
<code>
A game for 3+ people. One player at a time is the Guide. The rest are tourists.


Guide, hold your hand like you're speaking into a microphone. Try to make your voice sound like it's coming from a loudspeaker.

Begin the tour by pointing at something everyone can see and declaring a made-up "fact " about the subject. Invent fake names, places, historical events, etc., or twist real ones in unexpected directions. The more ridiculous and clearly false, the better:

"The Niagara Falls were constructed in 1994 as the first attraction of BuffaloLand, a new theme park. "


Taking turns, each tourist asks a question about the topic, attempting to derail the Guide by introducing a new fact:

"Is it true that the water was replaced with maple syrup in celebration of the bicentennial? "


The Guide must confirm the tourist's question and add or change a detail:

"Yes, and it took nearly ten years to clean out the pumps afterward.
                  "


The tourists vote to determine if the Guide's response was satisfactory. If it wasn't, the tourist who asked the question becomes the new Guide, continuing the tour with a new interesting "fact ":

"Approximately 47 gallons of water tumble down the falls daily.... "

Playing
You, the players, are the kind of people that don't get to be heroes on TV.
The person running things is the CEO. They'll call the cops.

Decide which 'corp you're hitting, and why. 
The CEO narrates the world's actions. You narrate yours.
Cause trouble. Run from the cops. Go home.

Characters
Distribute five dice across these Stats. It doesn't matter what dice they are.
Chrome is for using your cyberware.
Body is for punching, running, etc.
Mind is for hacking, speaking, etc.
Lose a Stat dice if you get hurt - take it back if you get help. If you have none left, you're dead.

Pick three Skills you're good at (one dice), and one Skill you're great at (two dice).

The more trouble you cause, the more Scene dice you get. Your CEO will decide how many, between one and three. Once the cops arrive, you get zero. It's time to leave. 

Rolling
Roll dice from (Stat + Skill + Scene). Odds equal one hit. 
Roll one less if it's hard or you're at a disadvantage. 
Zero hits fails. One gets you success at a price. Two gets you it without. 
The price might be your;

<h1>Bury Mary: The Great Lich's Bake Off</h1>
<h2>Peter Reitz</h2>
<code>
-- Setup --
Create Competitors (PCs): Our adventurers seek the Lich's magical trove.
     - What's your signature ingredient?
     - What school of magic infuses your baking?
     - What magical cooking artifact do you seek?

Describe Lich: Powerful but ennui-ridden, this spellcaster longs to die. Only perfectly crafted confections can destroy their phylactery.
     - What flavor is their phylactery?
     - Which ancient food-related specialty have they mastered?

Name NPC Competitors: Number = 7 - PCs.
     - What makes each NPC inadequate?

Determine Five Rounds: Biscuits, Breads, Cakes, Chocolate, Pastries, Pies, etc.

-- Challenges -- 
Each round:

1. PCs accrue +1, 0, -1 to their stats:
     Presentation
     Flavor
     Luck
2. Flip a coin for the Lich's Criteria: 
     Heads = Presentation 
     Tails = Flavor
3. PCs describe their bakes. Each rolls 1d6 + Lich's Criteria:
     6+: You're a frontrunner. Narrate the Lich's delight. 
     4-5: You're safe. Narrate the Lich's disappointment.
     -3: You're up for elimination. Narrate your baking disaster.

Frontrunners roll 1d6 + Luck. Highest roll wins; others become safe. 

Potential eliminees roll 1d6 + Luck; lowest roll loses and narrates their elimination.

If all PCs are safe/win, eliminate an NPC; if all NPCs are eliminated, eliminate the PC with lowest +Luck roll.

-- Endgame --
Fifth round: Winner narrates the ending ceremony and the Lich's release.

<h2>Aser Tolentino • www.twitter.com/aser_tolentino</h2>
<code>
Your ship falls toward a singularity. You are the sole survivor in the compartment. The damage control board shows one more life sign on the far end of the ship. You pick up the intercom handset and hope for the best.
One player is the engineer, the other the pilot. Place two coins in front of each player: players select whether they are heads or tails. If you don't want to choose, flip them. Do not show the coins to the other player. As you work to find a way to survive, symbolized by the states of the coins, you talk to each other about your lives for five minutes. After that, the work you have done will succeed or not. You may change the orientation of the coins as many times as you like, but never tell the other player the result.

Result:
4H Pilot dies and engineer survives
3H1T Pilot chooses who  survives
2H2T Both die
1H3T Engineer chooses who survives
4T Engineer dies and pilot survives

Afterwards, the survivor recounts what they remember of the person who died so that they might live.

<h1>But why was the green coat left in your hall?</h1>
<h2>Eva Schiffer • http://www.1000d4.com</h2>
<code>
There is a fine line between listening and being talked at. 

You are telling a story with a moral. Decide which of you is the listener and which the teller. The listener begins by asking the teller a leading question about something they saw or heard. The teller answers for as long as they like. When they pause, the listener should ask another leading question. The listener should try to change the course of the story with their questions if they don't like the moral the teller seems to be headed for. 

The teller should try to make space for the listener to ask at least a few questions before they reach a moral. The teller should try to push for a moral they personally find wrong but be willing to choose a different moral as the story shifts. 

Both players should treat past statements and the assumptions inherent in questions as truth. 

Reverse roles and repeat if time allows.

I have always wanted to make a game based on the d4 and Ninjas. Ever since I stepped on my first d4 I realized that they are just like the caltrops used by ninjas/warriors in feudal Japan. I have tried developing this into a larger game but keeping it simple (and under 200 words) I believe has allowed me to find a fun set of rules to play it with friends. Using narration and timing is the trick to be a successful Ninja in Caltrops the 4d4 RPG.

<h1>Camp Lottaspirit</h1>
<h2>Justin Dilks • https://twitter.com/Farchanter</h2>
<code>
Divide players into a Scout Patrol (up to four people) and a Counselor (GM). Give one standard card deck to the Patrol and one to the Counselor. The Counselor has the Patrol choose a name, and has each Scout introduce themselves with the following:

Name
Two best camp skills
One worst camp skill (Optional: keep this secret!)

The Patrol's goal is to defeat the GM-controlled Ghost at the end of the five-day camp. Each turn represents one day. Each day, the Patrol chooses one merit badge for the whole patrol to attempt. 

Merit Badges:

Swimming
Hiking
Archery
Basketry
Archaeology
Medic
Music
Astronomy
Astrology
Ghost stories
Skiing
Carpentry
Sports
Theater
Lifesaving
Silence
Friendship
Farming
Poisonous Animals
Sailboating

They roleplay attempting this merit badge. Beware, the Ghost can (through roleplay) try to interfere! The Counselor determines which players successfully earned the badge. Each successful player chooses one card to remove from either the Patrol or Ghost deck. 

After five days, it's time to battle! Shuffle each deck. The Patrol and Ghost battle by playing the topmost card from their deck, with highest card winning and earning a point (ties to the Ghost.) Whichever side reaches ten points first wins the game.

<h1>Can you hear me?</h1>
<h2>Eleanor Tursman</h2>
<code>
One player is the Ghost, the other is the Investigator.

Ghost: How do you know the Investigator? Choose a secret keyword or phrase to encapsulate your unfinished business.
Investigator: What draws you to this place?
Both: What kind of building houses this haunting?

Fill a small clear container with water. Collect several coins and some dark liquid, like ink. 

In each scene, the Investigator enters a room, declares the room type, and describes an interesting object in the room. The Ghost then attempts to communicate to the Investigator how this object is related to their death or unfinished business. Flip a coin into the container. If it's heads, the Ghost narrates successful and safe communication through either touch, an image, a smell, or a sound. On tails add a drop of ink into the container. The Ghost narrates how their attempt becomes twisted, smothering, or horrifying. The Ghost cannot communicate with the Investigator in any other way.

Conclude when either: the Investigator frees the Ghost by saying the secret keyword or phrase, or the coins in the container are no longer visible, leading to the Investigator's death. How do the Investigator and Ghost part ways?

<h1>Can't Teach an Old Bot New Tricks</h1>
<h2>Eric Fritz • www.drunkopus.com</h2>
<code>
Players split evenly into "robots " and "scientists " in matched pairs. The scientists give each other goals based on objects around the room and other robots. Each scientist writes INSTRUCTIONS on paper as a list of ACTIONS and REACTIONS, each with a single target. When everyone is ready each scientist gives the instructions to their robot partner. Robots and scientists can't communicate except through INSTRUCTIONS and REPORTS.

The robots follow their instructions as well as is possible, stopping when they accomplish the goal or hit an impossible action. When everyone has finished they return to the scientists and REPORT whether they accomplished the goal, or what instruction they got stuck on. The scientists update instructions and a new round begins. If a scientist's robot accomplished their goal, they get a new goal. Repeat for a total of four rounds.

Example ACTIONS:
Sit
Stand
Pick up TARGET
Put down held item on TARGET
Smile at TARGET

Example REACTIONS:
Item was offered -> ACTION
Item was taken -> ACTION
Bumped into robot -> ACTION

All players should stop to discuss safety out of game any time there's a potentially dangerous or awkward action.

<h1>CAPTCHA</h1>
<h2>adam mcconnaughey</h2>
<code>
One player is the (callous, curious) SCIENTIST, the other is the (hopeful, fearful) DROID. The DROID is one of a batch of 24, designed to infiltrate humanity. The SCIENTIST is testing the DROID to see if it can pass as human. If the DROID fails the test, all 24 will be decommissioned and the SCIENTIST will start over. Both characters know this.

Set up a game of "Guess Who?
                  "

The DROID chooses (from the deck) which of the options is its chassis. The SCIENTIST then asks yes-or-no questions of the DROID. There's a catch, however: any old robot can answer factual questions ("Are you blonde? "). The SCIENTIST is trying to tell whether the DROID can pass as human, so the SCIENTIST asks subjective questions that only a true human would be able to answer.

Examples:

"Are you beautiful? "
"Do you look angry? "
"Do you look like a muggle? "

After each question, the SCIENTIST flips down the faces that do not match the DROID's description. Play until the SCIENTIST has one or fewer faces remaining. If only the DROID's face remains upright, then the DROID has passed the test and gets released. In all other cases, the DROID has failed.

<h2>Marcelo Paschoalin • http://letraimpressa.com.br/index.php/tag/en/</h2>

You were all locked down for what you believe. Every day a heavily armed guard appears and takes one of you from the cell -- you never see them again.
Today the guard came, but one of you fought back. Now the guard lies down as your friend died to escape. Yet the cell is unlocked and you may escape... Will you be able to do it?

Select one of you to be the GM and narrate the conflicts and results. The others are now fugitives in this underground complex. Each fugitive has one Specialty they choose.

Give each player (GM included) five tokens. When there's conflict, the involved players hide as many tokens as they want in their hands and reveal simultaneously. Whoever has most tokens wins the conflict (ties are still ties) and handles all revealed tokens to the other involved players equally, keeping the leftovers.
-Specialties act like an extra (virtual) token if they are related to the conflict.

Fight for what you believe. Fight for your freedom. Death is just another prison.

<p>
How many of us live locked down in prisons without walls? How many of us are judged everyday by what we believe, what we think, what we are? This game deals with that, as every player-prisoner must gather strength to overcome the conflicts, either by themselves or working together. They don't know why there are in prison, only they believed in something others considered wrong.

The game is meant to be light narrative driven game guided by the art work on cards (or the stats if so desired) of your favourite taro deck, LCG, CCG or any other deck of cards with artwork.

Using a deck(s) of your favourite card game draw cards to represent your character(s) abilities, motivations, goals, and relationships to other players and the plot hook (also from drawn cards). The GM draws cards for inspiration/ furthering events; players draw 7 cards at the beginning and may play them to influence the story swaying it in their favor rewarded more cards for great narrative by the GM. If there is dispute on an action's success play of an appropriate card in reference to their abilities to resolve it is appropriate, otherwise a consequence (distancing the character from their goal) or GM can remove a card from that players abilities or add to their motivation.

<code>
You and at least one other are the bridge crew of a damaged starship. The ship departments such as Propulsion, Weapons, Navigation, Communications, Medical, Research, Hanger Bay. 

Collaborate to invent interesting people and fun stories while working to fix the ship. 

Each department has its own crew and at least one thing broken. Crews have subordinate crews. 

For each crew, build the scene: What is broken? Why? How? Opinions about those above you in the chain? Talk through the fix. 

When ready to see if the fix works, flip a coin (or dice roll equivalent). If Heads, report up the chain that the issue was resolved. If Tails, go down the chain for the subordinate crew to crew fix something.  

E.g. Your crew's attempt to fix the reactor core (Tails) caused a problem with the cooling array that the cooling crew needs to fix. They fixed it (Heads)? Try your the reactor core again. 

Players should change leaders and roles each step down the chain. Diagrams and notes are useful for stepping back up the chain, remembering what the break/fix is, etc. 

End when the ship is fixed or players are bored

<h1>Chalk Outlines</h1>
<h2>Fabrice Clarke</h2>
<code>
Materials: Blank paper (1 sheet each), pencils, whatever is nearby

Roles: Chief (1 player), Detectives (everyone else)

Rules: The Chief describes a crime scene that the Detectives have been called to. Each Detective then takes an item on their person or nearby, places it on their sheet of paper and traces around it. The Detectives must describe how these are potential clues which help solve the crime.

The Chief then takes one item from a Detective's sheet, places it on their sheet and describes a setback which the Detectives must overcome. 

The Detectives must find a new item each, place it on their sheet and describe how they use it to overcome the setback. 

Play repeats with new related scenes and setbacks until the Chief fills their sheet with items or they are satisfied.
The Detectives must now describe how all the items on the Chief's sheet fit together to solve the crime and name the culprit.

Item Placement Rules:
- Items must fit on the sheet of paper.
- Items cannot overlap each other nor any traced outlines of removed items.
- The same kind of item cannot be place twice on the same sheet of paper. Chief's decision is final.

</code>
<p>
This design has three main principles behind it. 

The first is that it could be played almost anywhere without the need for "special " equipment like dice. All that is needed is paper and a pen/pencil.

The second, that the rules are easily memorable and once learnt don't require referencing. This fits in with the "can be
                  played anywhere " principle.

Lastly that the physical item aspect of the game inspires creativity in the role playing aspect.

Chalk Outlines leans heavily on the "MacGuyver " trope and is probably best played tongue in cheek or "campy " rather than seriously as players are unable to fail, much like heroes in many serial shows.

<h1>Champion Battlegrounds</h1>
<h2>Nicholas Wimsatt • https://www.facebook.com/nicholas.wimsatt</h2>
<code>
A card game where each champion card has numbers on four sides and four corners that equal to a sum of 40 but no single number is greater than 9. Champion cards are placed on a seven by seven grid with a flag in the middle. The player that starts first will place one of their champions on the side or corner to the flag to capture it and place beads of the same color on top of the champion and flag to show they own it. The next player can place their champion on the side or corner of a champion or flag they don't own. When a champion card is placed on a side or corner of an enemy champion with a lower number that enemy champion switches over to the player's side and they place their colored bead on top, this can occur to multiple enemy champions in one turn. Each player continues placing champion cards on the grid until they run out and the player with the most colored beads on the grid wins. Champion cards can be shuffled and split between 2 or more players.
</code>
<p>
I had ideas of expanding this by giving champions the ability to block attacks by placing the letter "B " on one of the sides or corners so it gives the player a chance to strategize more with their champion cards. I came up with this idea when thinking about Reversi and the card game from Final Fantasy 8.

You are walking to town. You've walked this way a thousand times, but this is different: this will be the last time. A one-way trip. You're leaving and you're not coming back.

Where are you going? Why aren't you coming back?

On your way, you encounter people you know. They don't know you're leaving. Stop and talk to them.

Roll 15 d6 and put them in front of you.

Each encounter, one other player describes who you meet and another plays them. Spend one of your dice and play out an exchange based on its value. Continue the encounter with another die, or say your goodbyes and walk on. You may use any number of dice on each encounter, but you must use all of them in the end.

1) Tell them something
2) Reminisce
3) They ask you something, you answer
4) They ask you something, you lie
5) Give them something
6) Silence

After the sixth encounter, you have left everything behind. You're never coming back.



Roll 2d10.
On a 00: you were wrong. This wasn't a one-way trip. Roll the d6s again and walk home. Encounter everyone again, in reverse order.

2.- Define a magic system or use an existing one. The system must complement real-life recipes, just use magic variations, for example: add felicitas sugar (improves happiness), iracundias leavening and negatus flour (negates anger).
3.- Each player defines the character they will play. Start narrating it to the others by turn, explaining your current situation.
4.- Go home and send real letters to each other in character. Attach a bakery recipe. Attach a "consequence " for the recipe.
5.- The character that receives a recipe, bakes it, eats it and reads the "consequence ". Apply the magical effect to her character, further developing her and the story.
6.-  Answer each letter back in character.
7.- Repeat and enjoy the cakes. Play, maybe, for some weeks, months or a whole life.

<h1>Charon's Obols</h1>
<h2>Griffith Wood</h2>
<code>
You have died. Regardless of your previous life, you only have one goal now: To complete your journey into the Afterlife. Armed only with a pair of silver obols you must now journey into the unknown. 

Charon's Obols is an RPG for two or more players. One plays as GM (called The Guide) while the others play as the spirits who are trying to reach their final resting place. Each Spirit receives two coins at the beginning of the game. These coins represent the price that they must pay to have Charon ferry them across The Acheron. But! Be wary, for not everyone is fortunate to have been buried with two silver coins. Many other dead beings will attempt to take your coins through violence or treachery. If the spirits try any task with dire consequences upon failure, then they must flip one of their coins. If the coin lands on heads they are successful and can continue their journey. If the coin lands on tails then they have failed and they lose one of their coins. Spirits who lose both coins cannot pay Charon and become lost to the void.

What will you do to safely enter the afterlife?

<h1>Chart Star</h1>
<h2>Tyanna Lazauskas</h2>
<code>
The players are in a time-sensitive setting, solving puzzles and journeying across the land, navigating with the help of astromancy.
 
Characters are rolled with a 12 sided die. They fill out a star chart (like horoscopes). For example:
Mercury (Communication)
Moon (Secret intentions)
Mars (Conflict)
Jupiter (Luck)
Rising Sign (special flavor)
 
Each sign will have a certain affect in each individual sign. So if your sun sign is Virgo (the closest thing to a cleric), and your moon is in Aries (warrior class), you may struggle to balance being a leader and wanting to fight.
 
Every "day
                  " of game play, the Astromancer rolls a 12 sided die to see what constellation the moon is in. Like ancient religions worked their lives around the motion of the planets, the sun, and the earth, certain aspects of a character will be affected by this motion. For example, the moon moving into a more aggressive sign will cause warrior-type advantage, while characters with a peace-loving sign will be at a disadvantage. So characters are forced to try to solve puzzles together in different ways every day, as "fate
                  " works either for or against them.

<h1>Chiaroscuro</h1>
<h2>Briar Gray • https://twitter.com/briaroftheshire</h2>
<code>
(To be played in a library, museum, or other many-roomed building.)

You are lost, Travelers, far from the dark world you once called home. Your compasses are broken. You're surrounded by alien light.

Share with each other your hidden names. Why did you leave? What do you miss?

Move from room to room: every threshold you cross is a portal to a new reality. When you arrive, count the light sources. The more there are, the farther you are from home.

Take note of local customs - things may appear the same, but they are not. People are strange here. What has changed? What are the dangers? Try to channel your fear into curiosity.

Take solace in your companions. Some may leave to search elsewhere: Mourn them. Hope to reunite later on; if you do, share stories of your travels. How have you changed? What have you survived?

When you find yourself in total darkness, you'll know you've returned home. Inhale. The infinite black of your world brushes soft against your wings. You are cloaked once more in familiarity: deep, solemn, safe. Nothing can harm you here in the dark.

Exhale. Let your own light out, now. Illuminate the space yourself.
</code>
<p>
Inspired by Avery Alder’s work, especially Brave Sparrow.

I wanted to play with foreignness and anxiety, the sense of unbelonging in what should be a familiar space. I also wanted to subvert the usual safe/unsafe dichotomy of light & darkness. Finally, I wanted to explore light (and light pollution) as a destructive force; if you play Chiaroscuro at night, you should be able to find “home” easily by going outside, right? But that’s often not the case. Because of human intervention, true darkness is very difficult to reach nowadays.

If you play Chiaroscuro, let me know on Twitter how it went!

<h1>Childish Things</h1>
<h2>Evan Saft • https://twitter.com/NamesEquipped</h2>
<code>
What you'll need 
-A storyteller
-Some players
-Some mementos(toys, personal items, things from the past)
-A coin

The storyteller is the General. The players are Soldiers. 
The Soldiers are at war, far away from home, the only remaining members of their squad.  
The General has a Mission for the Soldiers to complete. 
The General begins by telling each Soldier their role in the squad. Each Soldier responds by describing what their eyes look like, and placing three mementos in front of them. 
The Soldiers then commence the Mission.
A Soldier will always succeed when taking a militaristic action. If a Soldier attempts any other action, flip a coin; heads, they succeed; tails, they encounter a complication. 
When a Soldier does something no one should have to do, they choose a memento, tell the others what it means to them, or a memory associated with it, and puts it away, removing it from the game.
While a Soldier has no mementos, the General controls their actions.
When you share a tender moment with another Soldier, you may give them one of your mementos. Tell them what it means to you. 
The game ends when the Mission is accomplished.

I had previously made a game using toys where they were intentionally devoid of meaning, I wanted to try a game where their meaning was paramount. Thanks to my partner Adele for helping me find the right words.

Chirographicon

The demon threads in shadow. Even children know this. Do not turn around and ask for favour. It will twist your wants around your neck and strangle you slowly... unless "they " come by. Only then will your soul have a chance at redemption.

"They " are people who specialize in winning souls of fools from the darkness. The only way to accomplish this - the Redimet Verse.

Prepare and show "them " the Chirograph and describe the tragedy it brought. Throw 3d6 to generate the words of the Verse:

Word 1: Catch Recite Race Cut Kill Trade
Word 2: Yourself Family Wife Child Demon Saint
Word 3: Cry Smile Moon Sun Needle Sword

Example: (4)Cut (4)your child's tongue out while (2)smiling. 
Example: (2)Recite a poem about (1)yourself while staring at the (4)sun.

"They " throw 1d6 each and keep the results, so do you - demon. 

"They " conjure up a way to trick you and bargain in the fool's name. 

Every sentence costs a point from that characters pool. 

You can ignore "their " words by paying the same price per sentence. 

Once someones pool runs out - they fall silent. 

Do not let "them " STEAL from you.

May the conciseness of thought be your sharpest edge against evil. Have fun tricking the devil out of his souls. This is a system I'm working on with a bit more of a comedic twist. It's loosely based on the Dogs in the Vineyard conversation system. I love the idea of using the players actual skills as the skills of their characters. Wit, word smithing, forethought can all be forged into weapons.

<h1>Circus Clown Bank Robbery</h1>
<h2>ghoek • N/A</h2>
<code>
You are a circus clown. You and your clown colleagues are robbing a bank. Why? How? That will be discovered as the story progresses. The GM fills in the scene. You can request a backstory scene anytime to flesh out how things got to where they are. Write down details as you elaborate on your character. Who are you? Who are the other characters? What brought you to this? You will find out as they are defined through narrative storytelling. If you take a contested action (where there is a chance of failure and consequences for failure), roll two dice. For something your character is bad at, take the lowest result. For something your character is good at, take the highest. Otherwise, take the average. 1-3 is failure, 4-6 success, round up. The backstory you create dictates your character's skill.
Maybe you're not after the money, maybe you're stealing sensitive documents from a safety deposit box.  Maybe you need money to pay for your daughter's surgery, or crave the thrill, or have no retirement, or you are a just simple clown mixed up in a robbery. 
Now, one of you must shout "EVERYONE ON THE GROUND " and begin.

<h1>City of Souls</h1>
<h2>Frederic Deux</h2>
<code>

You're a soul fragment of The City, incarnate as a human to rise against the rot that gnaws your mother.
Corruption, criminality, pollution.

One of your brothers has failed The City.
He's The Lost Soul.
He's your enemy.
And he's one of the players.


- Roll secretly 2d6 with the referee. The lowest roll designates the Lost Soul.
- Choose four Aspects: a name, and three other broad traits that may apply to both a human and a city's neighborhood.
- One has to be a serious flaw!
Ex: John, artistic, full of life, insane
- Each is valued 6.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To perform a difficult action:
 - Choose an appropriate Aspect (including Name)
 - Roll 1d6 and minus Aspect by one
 - Roll <= Aspect: success, otherwise: failure
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except Name, all Aspects can generate « low magic » (use your imagination).
A serious wound reduces Name by 1.
Reaching 0 on an Aspect means Soul's vanishing.


Play a short adventure in which characters fight corruption/criminality/pollution in a big city (think about "street-level
                  characters " in comic books).
If at the end the flaw of the Lost Soul is above 0 and lower than any "positive Aspects " of the other players, Mother City dies, and The Enemy reveals himself.
</code>
<p>
Ever since I was a kid I have really liked the Marvel and DC street-level characters such as The Punisher, Daredevil, Moon Knight, Batman, etc.
And, actually, I like all kinds of stories in which the city is also one of the main characters.
In these stories we can feel the breath of the city. It is alive, it has a conscience, a soul, a bright side and "a dark
                  half
                  " … and it naturally gives birth to villains and heroes.
One of the most interesting things about these street-level characters is that they are not so different from the villain(s) they fight so hard. They all have weaknesses, they all break the law - most are even murderers -, and if they sat down in a therapist chair they probably would be qualified as "psychos ".

Anyway, these are both basic and deep topics, with infinite narrative potential.
So, I wanted to give a try such a setting, in which a city literally gave birth to these two strong archetypes: heroes and villains.
I also wanted a touch of esoterism and a strong connection to the "Mother City
                  ", who gave the characters a part of her soul… and some powers by the way.
But most of all I wanted one of the players to assume (secretly) the role of the traitor, the one who works against the heroes in the shadow, the one who reveals himself at the end to claim: “Ah, ah, ah, ah! Finally, I won!”

Considering the “200 words constraint”, and since there are so many similar inspiring comic books and detective fictions to easily adapt, I did not feel the need to focus on the creation of the adventure itself.
But specific rules were needed still. They had to favor narration and, obviously, they had to be as simple as possible - but not simplistic -, concise, and light enough to easily set up a credible but short "one-shot " adventure.

Thanks for reading this.
Have fun!

PS: Many thanks to my wife and her limitless patience. ;)

<h1>Clash of the Villans</h1>
<h2>Jason Hicks • @bleak_rising on twitter</h2>
<code>
2-6 players
A game of ploys and schemes.
Players write name, description, and quote of their Villain on index card.
Also On Card:
Tactic   Enemy   Weakness   Reputation#   Henchmen#   Plot
Players pass cards to their right and rank Reputation and Henchmen from 1-4.
All cards are collected, shuffled and dealt.
Players receive tokens equal to 10-(Reputation+Henchmen).
Player with the highest Reputation+Henchmen, Plotter, describes a plot for world domination.  Write a rank from 1-5 for Plot.
Other players add tokens to a pool to describe ways they will foil the Plot until everyone passes.  If token played, write a description in Tactic, Enemy, or Weakness slot.
Plot is foiled if pool equals rank, tokens leave play; if pool higher Plotter takes excess tokens. 
If pool is lower, Plot succeeds, Plotter adds points to Reputation+Henchmen for each token in pool, and other players reclaim tokens.  
Players receive one token if at zero after Plot resolves.
All cards are collected, shuffled and dealt.  Players keep current tokens.
Play repeats, highest Reputation+Henchmen goes first, previous Plotter cannot go consecutively.
Expand on new Plots using previous ones and filled-in slots. 
First player to Reputation+Henchmen=10 wins.

<h1>CLIMB the SPIRE!</h1>
<h2>13sparx13</h2>
<code>
You need to get to the top!

You've got WIT, GRIT, & FLIT, for which you have 6 points.
Different weapons contest different attributes (opponents roll d6-pools). When you lose, drop an item or 1 point; when you win, get 1d6 XP. At 10 XP, gain a treasure or attribute point; after three victories, ascend a level.
Roll on a sheet of paper - if a die rolls off, don't count it. Cut the paper in half when you ascend.

-= EXAMPLES =-
WEAPONS
* Sword - Your GRIT/their GRIT
* Fireball - WIT/FLIT
* Sword (Sparkly) - GRIT/GRIT, magical
* Axe - GRIT+1/GRIT
GEAR
* Ring (Invisibility) - 4d6/WIT to fight, 3 charges
* Dimensional Warper - Spend 5 XP, tape on a cut-off piece of paper (it gets cut when you ascend, too)
* Potion (WIT) - Double WIT for a fight, 1-use
* Rope - Use to ascend
ENEMIES
* Ghost - 3/1/1 - Only hurt by magic
* Giant - 1/3/4
* Pit Trap - 0/0/0 - FLIT/3d6 to fight it
* Elemental (Extremes) - 0/1/6 - Rolls of 3/4 don't count

-= DM =-
Add stuff - enemies, items, rules, floor-specific effects, etc. - examples are only a starting point!
For single-player: write on cards to make a roguelike.
</code>
<p>
Looking at the rules, I guess there isn't an end point. I'm writing this on short notice (totally my fault for ignoring the email for 9 days, but whatever), so I can't test it to say where you should call your climb a success.

On the off chance you want me to add anything to this mess, pester me on reddit (/u/13sparx13), and I'll try to add more content and refine the rules (and add some of those floor-specific effects; wish I could've fit a couple in the rules, but I'm at an even 200).

<h1>CLOSING ARGUMENT</h1>
<h2>Alessio Venturini</h2>
<code>
Materials: paper and pencils.

The Lawyer preparing is closing argument to convince Judge and Jury of his client's innocence.
Each player takes 5 sheets and without being seen by other players writes:

- Crime Committed (drug dealing, rape, murder, etc.)
-  2 Positive Facts about the client (underage, abused, philanthropist, handicap, etc.)
-  2 Negative Facts about the client (alcoholic, junkie, pedophile, homicide, etc.)

Don't write innocent or guilty, this will be determined by final verdict.

Create two piles, one with the Crime Committed, the other with the Facts. Every players take casually from the piles one Crime Committed and 4 Facts.
 
In turn, a player will play the Lawyer and the others plays Jury and Judge.

The Lawyer shows the Crime extracted. Judge and Jury agree the "crime scene " and tell what happened (creates a simple and credible situations).

The Lawyer read privately the Facts extracted and creates a plausible story to get his client off. Remember: you can use Facts as you wish. What matters is winning. When is ready, the Lawyer says his closing argument.

The Jury votes.

The Judge votes (and his vote count as two). 

Say the verdict.

Continue clockwise.

The hearing is closed.

<h1>Cocktail Barbarians</h1>
<h2>Cal Wilks • http://wrestlepig.tumblr.com/</h2>
<code>
You are all Barbarians, empowered by the spirits of the land through traditional Shamanic Alchemy from the Cocktail Mountains.

Get a lot of different bottles of spirits together, as well as a few mixers and weirder stuff. The more the merrier. Get a scrap of paper for each ingredient and write a cool barbaric verb for each Spirit and Adjective for each mixer. Use the basics, like Punch, throw Lightning Javelins, and Argue.

Each Player comes up with their own Barbarian with a cool name, maybe even a personality beyond shouting.

Starting with the person who brought the most booze, each Barbarian narrates a scene involving an obstacle that must be overcome by one of the other Barbarians. One Player then alchemically assembles a cocktail from the available drinks, then combines  the cards into saying how  his Barbarian defeats the obstacle. Note what was in each drink.  That player now starts describing a new scene. If there's a teetotaler, they can stay as narrator.

Keep this going until the story feels finished or it's a health risk. The Barbarian who drank the largest variety of Liquids becomes the new Chieftain.

HARD MODE: Only bring a small amount of each drink.

<h1>Code Past Present Future</h1>
<h2>TheMonarchGamer • choiceandchancegaming.wordpress.com</h2>
<code>
Storytelling now controls the future of the world; the first AI must have its own memories.  Players portray software and sociology EXPERTS - each with their own agenda - attempting to collaboratively construct this first AI's memories.
One player may instead optionally be selected as ARBITER to ensure fairness.  Otherwise, all players function as the ARBITER together.
First, the ARBITER assigns all EXPERTS secret objectives (e.g. "Restore the Illuminati to power ").
The EXPERTS then take turns, starting from the Unix Epoch (Jan 1, 1970), describing one event that they give the AI as a memory.  These events may be made up, but a two-thirds majority veto forces the player to use a historical event instead.
This event is then written down (into MEMORY).  Play repeats until a date set by the ARBITER is reached (default: 2040).
At the end of the game, the players reveal their secret objectives and the ARBITER decides how much each event in MEMORY supports each player's objective by awarding STRONG INFLUENCE, WEAK INFLUENCE, or no influence.
Afterwards, all EXPERTS roll 1d6 for every STRONG INFLUENCE and 1d4 for every WEAK INFLUENCE they have.  The player with the highest roll wins and narrates the future.

<h1>Coin.heads</h1>
<h2>Andrey 'Random_Phobosis' Stoliarov</h2>
<code>
You are crooks in any setting where crime exist.


CONFLICTS

1. State intent.

2. Determine disposition:
  you have upper hand      advantageous   3 coins
  the powers are equal     risky          2 coins
  you're at disadvantage   desperate      1 coin

3. Toss the coins.
     
4. GM offers a cost (alarm triggered/bystanders hurt/ammo depleted). If you accept it, you may toss additional coins (the same amount), adding them to the result.
Repeat until cost is too high.

5. Count heads:
  1 - weaker alternative to original intent
  2 - success
  3 - triumph


COUNTDOWNS

1. Write impending event on a sticky note (guards alerted/hostage killed/evidence erased).

2. When something advances the countdown considerably/severely/tremendously, add 1/2/3 coins on the note, then toss all coins on it.
If less than 3 heads - countdown continues, otherwise the event happens.


LOOT
When selling stolen goods or getting paid, each player gets Loot coins.

Between missions, player may convert Loot to Aces (keep their pool separately). Spend an Ace by tossing it into a conflict. Use flashback to retroactively describe cool gadget/bribed NPC/devious plan.

Alternatively, Loot may be added to plot-level Countdowns (get rich/track down nemesis) to advance team or personal agenda.

Cold Hearted: A game of relationships and Indescribable horror in the arctic.

You are researchers who have uncovered something in the ice. In the base, tensions are running high.

Have everyone sit in a circle and give everyone three cards, face down. Place a bottle in the middle of the table. Give yourself a name,make it visible.

Starting the oldest player going clockwise, take turns spinning the bottle. When it lands on someone (Respin if it lands on you) choose one:

1. Tell a secret
2. Proposition alone time
3. Accuse another

If they go choose to believe or go along with you, flip a card face up,marking down their name. If this card is discarded, the player marked on it discards one of their cards instead.   

If they choose otherwise you discard a card. Depending on how many cards you have left, they narrate your encounter with the horror.

2: Something isn't right
1: A terrifying glimpse
0: Death

If you land on someone who has no cards left, discard 2 cards, and follow the discard step above. 

When only one person is left, the next person they land on narrates either their escape or their death.

<h1>Colony</h1>
<h2>Subsoap • http://www.subsoap.com/</h2>
<code>
Players take turns drawing a card from a 52 card shuffled deck and rolling a d20. 

On each player's turn, describe the development of a colony team sent to an unknown alien planet. 

At the start of the game, crew has just arrived and are coming out of cryo-stasis. Each player describes their crew member and picks a card suit to get a +2 on.

First card of each suit must describe initial state of its category. 

Keep a written journal summarizing events. Players must consider past events for what happens next.

A - 10 describes how interesting an event is. A boring. 10 interesting. JQK are exceptional events - use imagination.
d20 describes success of event. 1 is critical failure / disaster. 10 / 11 is not good or bad. 20+ is critical success leading to a breakthrough.

Event categories:
Heart - Crew... Social... Holiday...
Diamond - Technology... Building...
Club - Food... Resources...
Spade - Expeditions...

Game ends when deck is out of cards or a critical failure happens which would end the colony in some irreparable way. Critical failures can only happen with a roll of 1, and they don't have to be game ending they could simply remove some players from the game.

Event categories can be many more general topics thus the ... use your imagination for what related topics a suit could associate with given the context of other suits.

<h1>Committed!</h1>
<h2>Ken Maher • https://kenmgames.wordpress.com/</h2>
<code>
This is insane! You wake up in a room with complete strangers and no memories. You have ONE burning question and some hazy, half-formed impressions. Can all of you work to piece the threads together and discover a way out, or will you prove yourselves worthy of being committed?

Players will take turns asking their one burning question and the group will answer it together, in an effort to determine who and where they are, why they are there and how they can escape. Sounds easy right? Not so fast! 

You may ask only one "Who, What, Where, When, Why, or How
                  " question, BUT one that is given to you by Google's auto completion. (For instance: "How did I ... " "Why is ... " "When will we ... " ) Type in the beginning of your question and pick the suggestion you like best. This is what you need to know. The others will help you answer it, just as you help them with their question. 

If the players can craft a story that makes any sense of who they are, and why they are there they are free to go. If not, they are deemed fit to be committed!

<h1>Commuter Skills</h1>

You're trying to get to work on transit during rush hour, and you're set to be exactly on time. 

Choose 1 skill- 1. Never stuck in traffic.2. The driver knows the route. 3. No construction on the line. 4. No one peed on that seat. 5. Never travelling with a thousand school children. 6. Never break down.  

You have twenty stops to get to your job. Before each stop, roll a d6. Whichever number you roll, the corresponding negative effect occurs. Ie/ roll a 1, traffic is horrendous. Roll a 2 your driver is new and lost. For each negative effect, lose 1 transit minute.  If you roll your chosen effect, gain one transit minute, making you less late. Whoever makes it to work in less time, wins! 

Tell the story of what has happened. You're all on the same bus/streetcar/subway, so when something happens to one of you, you can all tell the story of your own reactions. If George rolls a 4 (and it isn't their specialty) how do you all react to them sitting in pee? 

Transit- fun for everyone!

Choose the setting (e.g. Venice or a teenager's mind).

Choose the goal (e.g. monopolize the pearl trade or who to ask to Prom).

Choose your character (e.g. Alfonsi Trading House or thinking of Sam).
 
Place your magnet on your card so that if two cards touch, the magnets strongly repel or attract each other.

Arrange the cards equidistant in a circle with one pole facing center so the magnets aren't interacting.
 
 
GAMEPLAY
 
Proceed in order of increasing age.

Describe a scene involving your character and at least one other, illustrating an attempt to achieve the goal.

If your character is described in a scene, move your card one card width toward the center of the circle.

If your magnet moves off the card or touches another, your plans blow up. Reset to your starting position, and describe how the previous scene ruined your efforts.

When resetting, you may choose to be destroyed. If so, describe how another profits and move them toward the center. Make a new character.

The first character to reach the center achieves the goal and describes the end.

<h1>Conches and Cameras</h1>
<h2>Takuma Okada • https://twitter.com/takuma_okada_ </h2>
<code>
It is the morning after a storm. The beach is littered with debris tossed up by the violent ocean. You, and maybe your friends, comb your way through the detritus in the early morning and find something unusual. What is it? Pick below, or roll a die.

1. A sealed container. Perhaps covered in barnacles.
2. A message. Recent, or archaic?
3. A deepsea item. What dragged it out of the depths?
4. A relic from a forgotten age. How long ago did this sink below the waves?
5. An ordinary object with signs of usage. What was the previous owner like?
6. A precious treasure. Natural, or man-made?

If you're playing with others, pass the object around. Take turns noticing its features. Ask questions, tell stories, and give explanations. You can use the example questions for inspiration or suggestions.

The dawn is breaking. The sun rises over the ocean, so tempestuous the night before, and now impossibly calm. Will you seek out the previous owner? Keep the object? Or throw it out to sea, for someone else to find?

Whatever you decide, take the long way home, and have a cup of your favorite hot drink.

<h1>Confabulation</h1>
<h2>Matthew Gravelyn • http://matthewgravelyn.com</h2>
<code>
Five players portray Witnesses of a crime and Detectives looking for answers. Need: pencils, 20 notecards.

-Setup-
Write Detective attributes on separate notecards:
- Personality: Arrogant, Intelligent, Cautious, Rookie, Observant
- Approach: Demand, Intimidate, Empathize, Bargain, Convince
- Flaw: Temper, Nerves, Overwhelmed, Distrustful, Lazy

Randomly take one from each category.

Write questions on separate notecards:
- What crime was committed?
- Who did it?
- Where did they go?
- When did it occur?
- Why did they do it?

Randomly take one. Write five answers on the back. Keep them secret.

-Witness-
Pass answers left. Cross off one answer. Repeat until only one answer remains on each. These are the answers. Hide them. Remember what you can. Memory is subjective.

-Investigate-
Take turns being a Witness. Detectives to your left and right question you. Set a timer for 3 minutes. Detectives act their attributes, attempt to learn answers. Witness reacts to Detectives, attempts to recall answers. Stop when the timer ends. Repeat for each player. Perception becomes truth.

-Deduce-
Detectives piece together answers to solve the crime. Do you know enough to confidently close the case or is it left unsolved?

If you close the case, check answers. Were you wrong?

How do you succeed or fail?
</code>
<p>
This game was influenced by the subjective nature of witness testimony, memories they believe to be entirely real. The term confabulation refers to the distortion or fabrication of memory without malice or conscious intent. 

Thank you to Jennifer Kaplan for helping me take my initial ideas and forming this game. Thanks also to Hannah Shaffer for her feedback and support.

<h1>Confess!</h1>
<h2>Kay</h2>
<code>
The 2 players make up a story about a crime (crime scene, timelines, evidence and such). Then they pick 10 main details from that story (place, missing objects or even the name of a pet) that will be the focus of the interrogation between the players. After that, they roll a D6 and who gets the higher number decides the roles they'll be playing: detective or culprit.
Out of those 10 details previously chosen, the detective secretly selects 6 proofs: 3 which the culprit will have to confirm and 3 which they will have to lie about (because only the real culprit would know them correctly).
The interrogation lasts three turns, each turn the detective can ask two questions to the counterpart about the 10 selected details. The culprit can answer the questions saying the truth or lying. 
At the beginning of the third and last turn, the detective removes one of the 6 proofs he hasn't asked questions about yet. 
At the end of the third turn the culprit is arrested and loses the game if they had answered in the wrong way at least three times (lying to those the detective wanted them to confirm or vice versa).

<h1>Consequence, the Tyrant</h1>
<h2>Richard de Winter • N/A</h2>
<code>
Requires: two people, 10-30 paper slips, pens, a cup.


Together, define a LEADER:

	Who do they lead? 
	What's their GOAL? 
	What two THREATS do they face?
	What's their title and name? 
	Which do they believe is best: to be loved, feared or respected?

One person plays this LEADER, one is the NARRATOR. 

Each turn:

1) [turn 4 onwards] NARRATOR may draw a slip from the cup, narrate CONSEQUENCES they wrote, then discard.

2) NARRATOR describes recent events and presents a difficult choice or dilemma that has arisen (possibly inspired by GOAL, THREATS, previous CONSEQUENCES). LEADER asks NARRATOR three questions to explore the issue, then describes their course of ACTION.

3) Both secretly choose a number from 1-3 and reveal. NARRATOR describes short-term CONSEQUENCES based on the sum: 
	5, 2 good
	4 mixed
	3, 6 terrible

4) LEADER secretly writes the possible long-term CONSEQUENCES of their ACTION on a paper slip, then conceals by folding in half. NARRATOR writes alternative CONSEQUENCES on the slip, folds again and places in the cup.

5) Swap roles.



When LEADER no longer leads, GOAL is achieved, or blank paper slips run out, each narrate short epilogue illustrating one aspect of the LEADER's legacy.

<h1>Continuity Error</h1>
<h2>Alexander Flores • https://twitter.com/alexwillwrite</h2>
<code>
You are now the editor of a superhero comic! In order to write issues of comics you have to have a character, so let's...

"Create A Super "
On a blank index card, write the name of your Super and describe their superpower in one sentence. [When doing this at the start you have 5 minutes total]

Now let's build our comic continuity! To do this we write comic Issues. You write an Issue by rolling 1d4 & using that result to prompt a one sentence summary of the Issue on a blank paper in pen. You have two minutes to write. When you're finished, title and number your Issue, pass the paper to the right, & the writing process starts over.

Roll:
1 - "Create A Super "
2 - Borrow a Super
3 - Free Reign
4 - Roll Again

Roll Again:
1 - Retcon
2 - Remove a Super
3 - Guest Writer
4 - Crossover Crisis! Everyone playing writes 6 Issues in 6 minutes together. These Issues end the continuity. No more Issues can be written on this paper. 

Save your cards! When you use a previously made Super for a new game you may add one sentence to the index card during the start.

<p>
This game based on my love of how goofy superhero comic lore can get and how (I would imagine) the pressures of time management, not knowing what other writers/editors/artists are doing, and editorial mandates can make that stuff a real fun mess. Thanks Maureen M., Victoria M., and Sergio F. for all the help. Have fun!

<h1>Convergence</h1>
<h2>David Andrieux</h2>
<code>
You accidentally discover a way to send messages to the past, which you realize later altered the future - in a terrible way. Will you repair that mistake, or fail and end up in a foreign timeline? And what will you sacrifice on the journey?
Determine as a group what is wrong. Maybe you attracted undue attention, suffered a loss, or started a war.
Take three dice showing the sequence '521'. The sequence indicates your current timeline coordinates. Your original timeline is '111'. 
Taking turns, you send a message up to two weeks back in time. Describe the message, add 1 to one of the die, and subtract 1 from another (adding 1 to a 6 brings you back to 1 and vice versa). Roll the remaining die. This is your new timeline.
The player on your left describes an unintended consequence, the player on your right something unchanged in the new timeline. You describe a positive change.
In timelines with identical coordinates (e.g. '222') the time-messaging device is destroyed.
The game ends when you reach timeline '111' or when the device is destroyed. Each player narrates their new life, what they gained, and what they lost in parallel timelines.

<h1>Corny Action Heroes!</h1>
<h2>Drew James</h2>
<code>
This game's about collaborative storytelling.

What you'll need:
 -Some Pens
 -Some Paper
 -Some Imagination
 -A Coin

GM Stuff
As the GM, your job is to provide the setting, the plot, to control the NPCs and enemies, and to moderate the character creation. Any genre will do.

Player Stuff
You can describe your four Action Hero Powers using 40 words total. Distribute the 100 words however you like. Beware, ambiguity benefits the GM, so word your powers carefully. Draw inspiration from corny action movies and shows.

ABILITIES are powers that can be used once per encounter.

SKILL are powers that can be used freely.

TALENTS prevents specific things from happening to your character once per encounter.

QUALITIES prevent a specific thing from happening to your character.

RESOLVING conflict requires your GM to flip a coin. Affected players must call the flip in the air. Successfully calling the flip means your Power worked correctly.

If successfully attacked, characters ascend the Doom Ladder:

GRAZED: GM chooses one power you lose.

INJURED: GM chooses a second

CRIPPLED: And a third

DEAD: You lose all powers but can still come back with some plot tomfoolery.

DOOMED: You are permanently out of the game.

<h1>Countries of Hats</h1>
<h2>Antoine RENAULT</h2>
<code>
It's the big night, you prepared for this day a long time ago when you change your identity for someone else. Your big evil plan will be executed tonight if you are able to survive ... the small talk at this high-level gala.

Each of the players writes the country and the capital name, and a short sentence for the base setting. This should constitute a base cliché for your Country of Hats. Choose randomly then each of the players chooses an evil plan and a reason why they are here. Start the conversation by presenting yourself.

Whenever a player introduces a cliché in the discussion or adds depth to an established one, they receive a Reputation token. Write the cliché for everyone to see. 

If a player says something conflicting to an already established cliché he loses a "Reputation " token.

When there is more than twice the players' Reputation token in-game, the game end. The one with the more Reputation will be able to propose his idea to the naive leader of the country.

<h1>CQ</h1>
<h2>Dan Noland • http://nolandda.org/</h2>
<code>
The Multiverse Transit Network is broken. Once everyone could travel
between universes. Some used technology, others magic. Now everyone is
stuck, but InterDimensional Messaging (IDM) still works.  

Make an IDM: record a video, post it to YouTube, and make a
G+ post. Make the video less than 4 minutes. Extra credit
for costumes, props, or VFX. Tag it #CQTheRPG on G+ so others can
find it and #CQReply.

Make long chains of videos!

When you make an initial #CQCall video you must address:
* Who you are.
* Where you're from.
* Where you're stuck?
* What difficulties you're having?

When you make a #CQReply you must address:
* Your identity
* Difficulties in your situation
* The outcome (see below) of the previous IDM. 
* Answer questions from the IDM and ask some new questions. 
* Explain an unlikely plan to help your interlocutor with their difficulties. Will it work?

Success / failure:
On upload your video gets a VideoID.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NcanVthL8A
Those numbers / letters at the end are the VideoID.  

Does the VideoID have doubled letters next to one another: aa or
-- but not aA. If it has doubles (odds: ~15%) your plan was
successful. On triples or better (~0.2%) it's amazing.

<h1>Crumbling</h1>
<h2>Jaye Foster • https://twitter.com/tweetjard</h2>
<code>
Work starts at the bakery at 5am, three hours before it opens.

Describe your role there and your personal problem.
Together describe a problem customer, a problem supplier, a problem recipe, and a problem competitor.

The players take turns to call a scene at the bakery, one for each hour until an hour after it closes at 3pm.

To take an action when the results are dramatically important;

Drop either your compassion muffin or your wisdom muffin from shoulder height.
If it stays intact, you succeed.

Every piece that breaks off larger than your thumbnail is an unfortunate consequence.

Select one piece larger than your thumbnail to continue with. The smaller it is, the lesser your success.
Eat the rest.
Sweep away the crumbs.
Throw away what is left when you finish work.

When there are no pieces big enough, you may continue to take actions, but without wisdom and compassion there is only hardship.

You may only buy new muffins at the start of the day.

Play as many days of work as you can stomach dropped muffins.

BLACK:
* Summon, d12 crumbling snow-zombies (6 ATTACK, 3 DEFENCE, 3 HP)
* Drain living, d12 HP damage, absorbing half
* Terrify, d12 minutes

To cast a spell, roll d12 below appropriate colour score to succeed, using that roll for the effect. Target can resist with a higher successful roll of opposing colour. (BLUE opposes WHITE opposes BLACK opposes BLUE.)

Begin at level 1 with 10 max HP. Whenever you overcome a significant challenge, roll d12. If you roll above your level, choose a colour, roll d12; if you roll above it, increase that colour, your max HP, and your level by one. At level 12, retire to an ice cave.

NPCs, traps, etc., have three colour scores if they are magical, otherwise ATTACK (opposed by WHITE/BLUE) and DEFENCE (opposes BLUE/BLACK). Vary colours to change magic themes. No scores above 12, but HP as appropriate.

In a world ruled by sorcerers, you have decided to challenge your lack of magic through gem alchemy.

To create an alchemist, chose two colors for your major color group and give yourself five gems of that color. Do the same for the two minor color group and give yourself three gems. The remaining colors are opposed, and you get only one gem.

You resolve actions by using gems of the color you want which changes the way you approach actions. Gems give you supernatural abilities, but also change your personality while you are attuned to theirs colors. More gems mean more power.

Red gems make you aggressively and with a sense of urgency. They increase strength and awareness.

Blue gems make you act professionally and calmly. They increase oratory and cognitive abilities.

Green gems make you act peacefully and in balance of your emotions. They increase endurance and health.

Yellow gems make you act cheerfully and optimistically. They increase speed and reflexes.

Purple gems make you act with sensitivity and love for other. They increase natural charm and empathy.

White gems make you act with balance and purpose. They cancel the magic of other gems.

<h1>Curb Your Better Off Always Sunny Development</h1>
<h2>Sean Fager</h2>
<code>

Spitball on a setting.

Each PC is, regrettably, affiliated to the others.  Write four character traits on individual index cards.  Take three chips.

Play three acts of three scenes.  Open on every PC together at a neutral location, and freestyle roleplay until everyone is satisfied and two or more characters have episode goals which don't align.  Following scenes are framed by the most recently humiliated character's player by default, but players may bid chips for control. At least one character is present. Others may be, either at the framer or player's discretion.

Each scene has one conflict.  If the conflict is PC against NPC(s), the framer handles the opposition.

Each party (or team), in turn, picks their own trait to use positively or an opponent's trait to exploit negatively, placing the card mid-table, facing themselves.  Continue until each trait has been used, or everyone passes.  Each character/team rolls two dice and adds the number of cards facing them.  The highest scoring character/team narrates the remainder of the scene but must use each talent they listed. 

At the episode's end every character who completed their goal AND suffered mortifying disgrace gains a new trait.

<h1>Curse You, Dingus McRee!</h1>
<h2>Christopher Reed</h2>
<code>
Everyone (up to 6 players!) hates Dingus McRee.  The characters hate him so much they have consulted the Internet to perform a ritual to curse him.  Did it work?  Or did they curse themselves?

The play sequence is as follows:   
 
Players roll 1d6.  Their number is their turn order (1=first, 2=2nd).  Ties re-roll until there are no duplicates.

The first player describes a basic, everyday task that character is performing.

The next player then describes the ritual to curse Dingus McGee and the previous character's responsibility in the ritual.

The final player then describes something that may go terribly wrong for the first player while doing their basic, everyday task.

The first player then makes a Luck roll.  To do this, the player declares a number and rolls 1d6.  If the character's declared number is no more than 2 numbers away, it means the ritual was a success!  If the declared number is 3 or more numbers away, it means the ritual was a failure and something horrible happens to the character.

Repeat for each player.  If at least half of the characters succeed, then the ritual was a success, and Dingus McRee is cursed!

<h1>Cursed Chronicle</h1>
<h2>Connor Weide</h2>
<code>
You are historians charting the course of a cursed Artifact through the ages. You'll need a deck of cards and up to 9 players.

Decide what the Artifact is: an item and descriptor. Give it a Boon and a Curse. Example: Silver Goblet, Wealth / Violence.

Take as many numbered cards as players, making an unbroken sequence starting with 2. Shuffle and deal one to everyone, face down.

Shuffle together all face cards and one Ace. Deal one to everyone, face down, ensuring someone gets the Ace. Never reveal yours.

You will tell the history of an Artifact Bearer. Your number represents their order in the Artifact's succession, 2 being most recent. Your face card suggests their Fate:

Hearts: Passion
Diamonds: Vice
Spades: Conflict
Clubs: Growth
Jack: Family
King: Enemy
Queen: Stranger

Take turns: Reveal your number, then describe your Bearer. Tell how:
... they acquired the Artifact,
... its Boon and Curse affected them,
... they died.

Weave a consistent chronicle of the Artifact's history.

However: the Ace-holder is the current Bearer of the Artifact, covetous of its Boon. Tell an apocryphal history of your assigned Bearer, warping the other players' histories.

At the end, players try to determine who the Bearer is.

<h1>Cuteness Battle!</h1>
<h2>Celine Oon</h2>
<code>
You're all cute things, in battle to determine who's the cutest of all. As cute things, you're powered by the cutest foods of all: desserts!

Decide on themes for everyone's cuteness.

Put a different dessert in front of each player, all of similar size. Don't use dessert that degrades over time, like ice-cream.

Randomly pick first player.

A turn goes:
1.	Choose player to attack.
2.	Do/describe something thematically appropriate, cute and magical, and bet a portion of dessert on it. More fancy, more dessert.
3.	Players not in battle decide if bet is adequate, or if attacker should bet more.
4.	Attacked player either responds in kind, or surrenders equivalent portion of dessert to attacker.
5.	If attacked player responds in kind, players not in battle vote on the cuter performance/description. Winner gets dessert bets.

Play rotates clockwise.

In case of tie, players in battle eat a portion of dessert in secret. The player who eats more wins.

When a player loses all dessert, they're out of the running! They can still vote.

Last player with dessert remaining is the cutest thing of all, and gets exclusive bragging rights.

When game is over, everyone eats dessert together!

<h1>Day at the Planet</h1>
<h2>Emily Savidge</h2>
<code>
A 1v1 game about surviving the terrestrial.

Roles: 
The Alien; a physically all-powerful being limited only by necessary secrecy. Their goal is to go unnoticed. 
The Planet; The Alien's normal human workplace and the colleagues/superiors therein that must be placated and kept oblivious. They present The Alien with tasks. 

When The Planet presents a task (eg. drink coffee, type a report) they give a target number: 
     7 (minimal effort for humans) 
     10 (average) 
     14 (unreasonable) 
     17 (beyond human limitations) 
The Alien then rolls any number of d6 they choose. 

If the result is up to two above or below the target number, they succeed and narrate their actions accordingly. 

If they are 3 or more below the target number, they narrate their failure from insufficient effort (they fumble/drop the mug, the report is late). 

If they are 3 or more above the target number, they narrate how their over-achievement arouses suspicion (they crush the mug in their grip, the report is impossibly detailed). 

The game ends when: 
     The Alien fails 3 tasks and is fired for incompetence 
     The Alien over-achieves 3 tasks, is exposed as an alien, and shunned 
     The Alien gets through the day

Everything is dark, dirty, dangerous and deadly like Blade Runner, Mute, Dredd, Ghost in a shell and Altered Carbon. 
Needed: game master (GM), players, pen and paper and three six sided dices (3d6).

Character creation:

Name: 				name
past: 				company, police, gutter, army etc.
archetype:  			killer, hacker, driver, tech etc.

Describe your character.
GM assigns equipment and money.

For doing something insecure role 3d6.
GM adds a number between -7 to +7 based on situation and character.
11 or more is a success. A higher result is a better success.

All actions in a fight are mostly simultaneously.
Melee before guns.
Drawing a gun needs one combat round.
After a hit, GM judges injury by  height of role and situation.
Rule of thump: Two full hits with a melee or one shot may be deadly.


The GM is responsible for the story and everything which is not a player character.

Psychically gifted - you catch glimpses from that world; but cursed - the War still ravages the Magical World you left behind, and now you can only bear witness. As you travel this Mundane World, you journey across the Secret World. 

Look for GRAFFITI. When it catches your eye, take a photograph. Each GRAFFITO is an eruption of psychic energy from that Secret War piercing the veil between our realities:

Is it an omen? Portent?  Lie. A rare Truth?
Perhaps, a request? Instructions? A map?
A victorious tale, or a doomed romance?
The last words of a queen, or a beggar?
A spell or dread ritual?  An attack!
The sigûl of your nemesis...

What it is, what it was, what it means - a riddle to be solved.

TERTIUS
Share your findings when your Cohort gathers.  Hopefully, through the Alchemy of Combination, we can understand these sendings and images. SHARE A GRAFFITO, explain what you think it means. Perhaps, another refugee will find meaning in it, and bring forth their own. Solve the Riddle. BEAR WITNESS.

<h1>Deal With The Devil</h1>
<h2>natalie • https://dice.camp/@rpgnatalie</h2>
<code>
Start with eight "chips ". On four of the "chips ", write down a one sentence of a cherished memory. On the other four, a trait you hate about yourself.

Play a hand of blackjack with your friends. You bet with your "chips " - when you bet with a "chip ":
 - Tell the story of your cherished memory
 - Say why you dislike that trait in yourself

When you bet with someone else's "chip ":
 - Tell the story of their memory, but change something important.
 - Say why you dislike that trait, but for different reasons.
It's yours now.

The cap per round is two "chips ".


When you have traits from other players, you must act in accordance with that trait. When you lose traits, you may no longer act in that way.

When you have memories from other players, you may access their knowledge of that memory. When you lose memories, you can no longer remember what you once treasured.

When you win back a memory, it's no longer the same; when you bet with it, change something important.

When you win back a trait, you're no longer the same; when you bet with it, give a different reason for why you hate it.

<h1>Dealin' with the Devil</h1>
<h2>Chris Hale • https://twitter.com/thechale</h2>
<code>
You have died and find yourself in hell. 

The Devil will release you if you can identify a fellow captive and keep your identity a secret.

Players select a deceased historical figure.

For every year since your death, take a point. Keep points secret until a tie, highest total breaks it.

Players RP, asking and answering questions, with only the knowledge their characters would have.

Cleopatra could not ask if someone was on television.

Deal a french deck as evenly as possible. Death, like life, is unfair. 

Decide who begins. They may pass, or assign a card to another player, who follows the card's directive, and then plays a card. Once played, discard cards. A player can risk half their cards to guess an identity. If a player runs out of cards or is correctly guessed they're eliminated. Play until there's a winner.

A- Playable anytime, skip directive.

2,7- 2 minutes of suit based RP

3,8- Answer 3 Y/N questions.

4,9- 4 minutes of suit based RP

5,10- Answer 5 Y/N question

6- FREE GUESS

J- Name a person often associated with you

Q- 2 people

K- 3 people

HEARTS - Loves     DIAMONDS - Conflicts     CLUBS - Accomplishments    SPADES - Character's Choice

<h1>Demonic Cupcake Failures</h1>
<h2>Pieter van Hiel • twitter.com/pietervanhiel</h2>
<code>
Ghosts have many reasons to haunt us. Forlorn love and revenge are poetic, but some ghosts just have unfinished mundane business. Such is the case with deceased bakers who haunt us in the hope of passing on lost recipes.  In this game, players are paranormal investigators on a reality show about contacting dead bakers and bringing them peace in the afterlife. 

Game requires:
Ouija board
Cupcake recipe

Play happens in six stages:

Players create a paranormal investigator persona.  One player is also the narrator who lays out a scenario. "Grandma 's Bakery has been haunted for 30 years by a restless spirit!"
Players take turns expanding on the haunting. "I sense Grandma hated raisins. She burns any raisin cookies baked here."
Use the Ouija board to ask the ghost questions about their history and reason for haunting.  
Ask the ghost for two ingredients to complete the recipe. 
Acquire ingredients (if possible) and bake cupcakes.
Judge the cupcakes.

The success of the show is judged as follows:

Fantastic cupcakes! You contacted the ghost. The spirit can rest.
Terrible cupcakes. You contacted the wrong ghost. Try again!
Impossible cupcakes. You contacted a poltergeist. 
Poisonous cupcakes! You contacted a demon. DO NOT EAT.

<h1>Devil is in the Details</h1>
<h2>Nicholas A Malinowski</h2>
<code>
Each player is secretly given three pre-written memory cards.These can be anything from fun times at the beach or amusement park, dealing with an abusive parent, maybe something on the horror front and remember being haunted by a ghost. The memories should run the gamut of happy, maybe horrific, but sad as well. Each player should have at least one positive and one negative. 

The players then roleplay going to school with these memories

Players will work through  the story.  Players may attempt to perform any action. The ST then  determines the outcome or may ask for a die roll, setting the difficulty, thus creating a challenge. 

The goal is to explore how memories and emotions drive actions. The ST will challenge the players with atypical school experiences designed to cause the memories to flare up. The concept is to try and understand how emotions are at the heart of our actions and how to persevere with the negative.

<h1>Die Zombies!</h1>
<h2>Zachary Knight • divineknightgaming.com</h2>
<code>
Can you survive the zombie apocalypse? Guide a band of plucky survivors to the last remaining secure settlement.

A game for two players. One controls the zombie encounters and rewards, the other controls the team of survivors.

Player 1 gets one d10 and 1 d6. Player 2 gets 5 survivor tokens and two d6s. 

Play starts with player 1 describing the encounter, and rolls the d10 to determine the number of zombies encountered, a roll of 0 is 10 zombies. Both players roll for initiative with 1 d6 each. If player 1 rolls high, it is a surprise encounter. If surprised, player 2 rolls only one d6 during this encounter, if not, player 2 rolls 2 d6s.

During the encounter, both players roll their d6s. Players compare highest rolls. If Player 2 wins, ties going to Player 2, one zombie is killed. If Player 1 wins, one survivor token is killed.

If all zombies are killed, Player 1 describes what they win, either food, ammo, medicine or even additional survivors. Play moves to the next encounter. If all survivors die, the game is over. If Player 2 wins 10 scenarios, they win the game.

<h1>Dinner at Dusk</h1>
<h2>George Tangen • twitch.tv/trippy108</h2>
<code>
You've been invited to a fancy dinner party by a wealthy host. Game Master decides the party 's setting and makes NPCs to add intrigue and drama. 

Players make a character who is in attendance and decide what they seek from a guest(s) at the party. Characters should come to the party with relationships they have with at least two of the many wealthy or famous guests, could be other PCs.

Skill ratings are set by rolling 1d6. Roll against other guests' relevant skills by rolling d6 equal to your skill rating.
                  The highest result succeeds and the GM determines the consequences. Charm- impress, compliment, befriend
                  Deceive- lie, sleight-of-hand, hide Duel- fisticuffs, pistolling, swords Romance - flirt, matchmake, attract
                  Question- interrogate, gossip, perceive GM should provide challenges for the PCs. Example: If a PC 's goal is to propose to a woman, have an aggressive NPC be in love with her. The game should provide scenes and equipment for players to have chances to accomplish their goals; this is on the GM.

At the party's end, PCs and NPCs who completed their goal may add one skillpoint anywhere for future dinner parties, failure
                  reduces one skillpoint chosen by GM. </code>

                    It's the year 2200, and micro-gravitational space hotels are the latest travel fad. A hotel and spa orbiting Mars is opening
                    soon, and a retired troupe of opera singers have the vacation on their bucket list. Since it's their
                    first time off Earth, the women hire your travel agency to scope out the hotel to ensure the station
                    is accessible for aging folks wanting to enjoy weightless cruising. How to Play: You need a GM, 2 to
                    4 players, and two d20s. The hotel manager (GM) shows the agents (players) deluxe guest suites, restaurants,
                    the spa, and more. Players make up ways the hotel is inaccessible for the divas. They must then offer
                    a solution for each location. The GM decides if the solution is feasible by rolling a d20. 11 and up
                    is a success. If players fail, they think of another solution and roll their d20 to counter. Success
                    is a roll higher than the GM's initial roll. If players fail three times in a row (including GM rolls),
                    the divas fire your travel agency with dramatic flair. If players can solve 7 access barriers, the divas
                    pack up their 20 suitcases each and book the trip!

                    It feels a little strange to include explicit win states for the players as it makes the game feel more like a board game
                    than an RPG. But it was ultimately necessary to create the experience I was looking for. The idea was
                    to simulate a first-contact scenario, with all the uncertainty that comes with it. I wanted to make communication
                    difficult, introduce suspicion and lack of trust, and make it possible for everything to fall apart despite
                    the best of intentions. After a number of iterations, a Charades type mechanic was the most efficient
                    way to complicated communication; although it required introducing asymmetry to the interaction and means
                    the roleplaying needs to be entirely non-verbal. Blackjack proved to be a good mechanism for determining
                    when negotiations break down because it introduces uncertainty into the countdown. But I just couldn't
                    find a way to introduce suspicion without giving each player an explicit goal and a reason to pursue
                    it. It still feels more like roleplay to me, but I can see how others may feel differently. If you play
                    this game and find PEACE too easy to achieve, the difficulty is easily adjusted by increasing the number
                    of trinkets or replacing the trinkets you're using with others so that each player has trinkets that
                    are difficult to differentiate through gestures. You can also replace the trinkets with words written
                    on pieces of paper so that you can use concepts as well as physical objects. The idea of trading concepts
                    is something I wanted to include in the original entry, but in the end it was a victim of the word count.

                    Two demi-gods trying to prove each other wrong about the meaning of a mortal's life. One of you (Do) was trapped inside a
                    labyrinth while the other (Undo) handles the rooms and encounters inside it. Shuffle a rubik's cube and
                    give 6 colored cards to Undo, each card a color in the cube, and a concept. Blue:Sloth Red:Lust Orange:Gluttony
                    Green:Envy Yellow:Greed Black/White:Wrath Undo chooses a card and narrates a story bit with the concept,
                    presenting an obstacle (AND solution) for Do inside the labyrinth until he runs out of ideas, while Do
                    tries to solve the cube. 4 minutes minimum. If Do completed the side shown in the card, earns a point.
                    Otherwise Undo earns it. Cards can only be played once. 2 minutes pause and cube is passed. Do must narrate
                    the solution that the character came up with for that conflict, while Undo shuffles the cube. If the
                    solution proposed isn't adequate given the narrative, Undo may ask Do to re-think it. 2 minutes, minus
                    20 secs x side solved by Do. Repeat until Do solves the rubik cube (Do wins), or when Undo runs out of
                    cards. Highest score wins.

                    Storytelling about friendship between Emma Tetra, teen witch, and Downer, a giant monster: You need index cards and markers.
                    Take five index cards. On one write GOAL; another write MISS BEHAVE; another TRAGEDY; another INTIMACY;
                    the fifth SUCCESS. The 5 cards start the deck. Shuffle them. Place words down. Take turns drawing a card
                    and adding story. For each card, describe Emma's experience related to the card. If you draw GOAL, describe
                    Emma acquiring a new goal, a vision--maybe reinvestment in old objectives. Same when MISS BEHAVE's drawn,
                    describe Downer miss behaving. For TRAGEDY, describe a TRAGEDY happening. Make sure the storytelling
                    plays in shared narrative created by players before you. For INTIMACY, intimate moment between Emma and
                    Downer. For SUCCESS, Emma achieves a goal or something good happens to them. When no cards are left,
                    the next player writes a new event, abstract or concrete, on a clean index card (Examples: "ENTERS EXTRA
                    DIMENSION", "IRONY", or "DEVELOPS CRUSH"). Shuffle card in with the deck, put all cards words down, and
                    the next player draws from top, and the game loops with a new card being added each round. Game ends
                    when a THE END card's created and drawn.

                    Players are old adventurers sitting around a fire who remember the history of their kingdom. Each in turn must bring an additional
                    element to the story and draw it on the map. The first player draws the kingdom in the center of the
                    map and divides the rest into blank areas (1 per player). Age of Balance ************** Each player determines
                    the content of one of the blank areas (geography, population and relations with the central kingdom)
                    by rolling a D6 (1-2: good for the kingdom, 3-4: neutral for the kingdom, 5-6: bad for the kingdom).
                    The player justifies his story by drawing a geographical element on the map. Once everyone has played,
                    the players debate by show of hands about the physiognomy of the kingdom (economy, politics, life...).
                    In case of a tie, roll the dice to break the tie. Age of Crisis ************* A player tells the big
                    event that turned the kingdom into a crisis. If the first player chooses to tell a positive event, the
                    second must follow on from the negative consequences of the previous event and so on, alternating positive
                    and negative. At the end, the players debate the fate of the kingdom.

                    enter the Dream Realm. Randomly choose a Character to start. The player to their left creates a sentence
                    of no more than 4 words. Flip a coin. Heads earns the Character a Dream Token, Tails gives them a Nightmare
                    Token. Using the created sentence the Character describes the emerging dream or nightmare and it's importance.

                    describe how their Characters work together to overcome the nightmare but lose the dream fragment. Cross

                    Duel of Wish is a two-player world-building role-playing game in which one player portrays a serene Djinn and the other portrays
                    a cruel Ifrit. The Djinn's goal is to create a world of bliss and harmony. The Ifrit's goal is to create
                    a world of suffering and chaos. The player who first suggested playing must portray the Ifrit. Once someone
                    has played with a particular opponent, they may never play with them again. Starting with the player
                    who most recently attained their heart's desire, players take turns asking for and granting wishes. Djinn
                    and Ifrit, after all, may only use their full and awesome power in the service of another. Each wish
                    must be for some specific and worldly (if vast) circumstance, and must be performed to its letter, but
                    not necessarily its intent. Given the Djinn and Ifrit's opposing visions for the world, perhaps they
                    will take their foe's words and twist them to their own ends. The game continues until one of the players
                    has a prior obligation they must attend to, allowing their opponent to grant one more wish before they
                    part ways. The world is then a settled thing.

                        Dungeons & Driving is a slow-paced road trip RPG, where the driver of a car is the DRIVEMASTER and the passengers are WARRIORS,
                        SORCERERS or ROGUES. Play begins when adventurers enter a dungeon (i.e., the car enters an on-ramp).
                        The Drivemaster tells a story, and at critical junctures when the adventurers encounter a monster,
                        trap, or other obstacle, they are challenged to find a vehicle of the the Drivemaster's choosing
                        on the road. This is their opponent. The first player to find it is drawn into battle. Battle Order:
                        Drivemaster adds the numbers on the opponent's license plate. Players add the numbers on the plate
                        of the first vehicle of their type they see (warriors are SUVs and trucks, sorcerers are vans and
                        sedans, rogues are motorcycles and compacts.) High number wins. If the player prevails, they receive
                        treasure based on the defeated plate. Local plates are 10 gold pieces. Plates from bordering entities
                        are 20. Other rewards are determined by the Drivemaster. If a player loses three battles, they're
                        eliminated. The player with the most treasure at the dungeon's exit (an off-ramp or a mileage goal
                        set by the Drivemaster) wins. Customized/homebrew car rules are encouraged!

                        **Character Creation** Characters begin with five Merits (defining traits). Merits should generally be one-to-two words,
                        such as "archer", "strong swimmer", "socialite", "champion sleeper". Players should have at least
                        one for social, combat, and exploration situations. The Game-Planner may want to avoid Merits that
                        are too broad. **Playing** The Game-Planner presents goals; Characters achieve goals by interacting
                        with the world. **Conflict Resolution** Whenever Characters want to do something, but an obstacle
                        exists, conflict occurs. Conflicts are resolved through Difficulty-Checks. The Game-Planner sets
                        Difficulty-Checks, but may use this guideline: Easy - 5+ Medium - 7+ Hard - 9+ Legendary - 12+ Oppose
                        Difficulty-Checks by rolling a twelve-sided die and adding +1 for each relevant Merit; success occurs
                        if the total matches/exceeds the Difficulty-Check. Demerits are like inverse-Merits. Each Demerit
                        grants +1 to relevant rolls against their owner. Examples include "broken armor", "publicly shamed",
                        "drugged". - If damage occurs, apply a Demerit. - Characters may attempt (possible Difficulty-Check)
                        applying/removing Demerits from a target. - If creatures/objects have five (or more) Demerits, they're
                        considered unconscious/broken. - Characters decide what happens to unconscious creatures after successful
                        conflict-resolution. - Demerits go away after conflict-resolution. **Advancement** Characters may
                        advance by gaining more Merits, which should be derived from in-game accomplishments.

                        does this belong to?" They'll improvise, whatever comes to mind. Now ask someone else. Both answers
                        have some truth in them, but neither is entirely right. Synthesize: tell the group the right story.

                        some truth in each, but neither is entirely right. Decide whether you want to keep the object, or
                        let it go. When everyone's opened their eyes, don't speak. One by one either put your object back

                        This game is set in New Zealand where industrial dairy farming is a major political controversy and the volume vs vitality
                        duality maps to the real spectrum of public opinion. It’s not always obvious that this style of farming
                        is an extraction industry like mining (where soil and water are consumed). I thought it would be
                        interesting to experiment with this as a game mechanic: profit can be yielded from farming immediately,
                        but it takes much longer to restore the ecosystem to native forest. While imagined as NZ-specific,
                        the 200 word constraint meant cutting out a lot of local detail, meaning it could be adapted to farming
                        typologies and landscapes from other parts of the world too.

                        has played Forge. Hero casually mentions a pantheon of gods, and explains why they are its champion.
                        Threat decides what threatens the pantheon, and why. Smith describes who comissioned a new weapon,
                        and what is crafted in response. Forge describes how it secretly undermines the weapon. Threat describes
                        how it destroyed d100 percent of the pantheon. Hero describes how the weapon drove back Threat, but
                        will never again be the same. Forge describes how Hero lost the weapon and how it went on to further
                        Forge's agenda. Smith describes how/why the weapon was eventually destroyed or fell into disuse,
                        and why Forge will never be free.

                        The concept of playing as a planet has haunted me for a while. I'm really fond of the idea of having inanimate objects as
                        characters. The planets don’t have civilization or intelligent beings. I’d like it to be played with
                        players describing how their resources are exploited by humans and how their landscape changes, and
                        although destruction is inevitable, they want to have it their way. Oh, and I had a lot of fun describing
                        my colorful d12s as if they were planets. I hope you enjoy it! Extended version (in progress): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpymQEv53DtcNjV9yFOxDDdZnOCgHdYK_W5oK-sDOBI/edit?usp=sharing

                        ENVOY is a game about persuasion, cultural perceptions, and getting what you want. You will need: - 3+ players - tokens (coins,
                        marbles) One player is the Envoy, a human sent to understand an alien world. The others are representatives
                        of the alien culture. Each should have different ideas: representatives have agendas. Take three
                        tokens and decide on yours. On the Envoy's turn: recount what you know about the alien culture. Then,
                        ask one question. All other players may bid favor tokens; whoever bids highest answers. On a representative's
                        turn, choose one: - Give the Envoy a gift. Describe it, and what it cost you. Take one favor token.
                        - Show the Envoy around. Tell them one detail about the world. Pay one favor token. - Bribe another
                        player. Give them two favor tokens and tell them one detail about the world you want them to agree
                        upon. - Undermine another player. Describe how you discredit them and trade favor tokens. - Contradict
                        something. Pay all of your favor tokens (3+) to change one thing the Envoy knows. After ten rounds,
                        the Envoy returns to Earth to disseminate their understanding of this culture. Human perceptions
                        are hard to change; whatever understanding prevails is set in stone.

                        the Authority plays all powerful figures. Players whose Soldiers are in the scene roleplay themselves.
                        Players whose Soldiers are elsewhere or dead can whisper as whatever they feel fits: nature, the
                        environment, faceless soldiers, enemies. There will be a conflict, and the Authority will make it
                        about two Soldiers. Both those Soldiers simultaneously write poems. These poems are four lines, in
                        ABCB rhyme scheme. (Break these rules to taste, rarely and purposefully.) Non-poets may whisper,
                        but only to each other. The Authority will read both poems aloud, selecting one "victor" (usually
                        but not necessarily the best poet). The losing Soldier dies; the Authority declares how. The winning
                        poem will be put in a safe place. The Authority chooses one word from the losing poem to be carefully
                        cut out and preserved-- an epitaph. The rest of the losing poem is destroyed-- war kills poems. Rip
                        it, cut it, sing it no requiems. If you have fire, turn it into ashes.

                        University High School Tabletop and Writing Clubs for their playtesting and feedback. The game can
                        handle more than you might expect, from Catch-22-style antics to Dunkirky horror. You might want
                        to set expectations beforehand, though, and definitely play with an X-Card.

                        Goal: Using prompts from another player and playing cards, live another life. Setup: Each player takes one color of a deck
                        of cards and shuffles the numbered cards. Deal two cards face-up and one face-down then shuffle their
                        aces and face cards into their half-deck and place the face-down card on top. The face-up cards provide
                        the starting point for your life's story. The value of each card represents how well-off your parents
                        were. If the cards are of the same suit, then your parents are still together at the start of your
                        story. The sum of the two cards is your starting age. Play: Each turn, players select a category
                        (Family, Health, Love, Money, Law, Faith) for their partner then draw a card. Each player then relates
                        what occurred to their character over the revealed period of time. This continues until both characters'
                        lives are ended. Cards: Numbers - How many years have passed Faces - An addition/detraction to the
                        previous event Aces - First ace is an existential crisis - something that causes a drastic change
                        in your life's direction. Second ace is when your character dies. Suits - Your character gains (hearts/clubs)
                        or loses (diamonds/spades) during this life event.

                        name. Label the other three boxes "Body," "Brain," and "Personality." Write down facts about yourself
                        in each of the categories that are true, and also good. Keep going until the sheet is full. If you're
                        playing with others, each of you should write down a fact, then pass the sheets in a round, helping
                        the other players fill theirs out. When the stats boxes are full, think about those facts as if they
                        described an interesting stranger and decide: How old are they? Where are they from? What is their
                        name? Write these details in the first box. Think about the next three lines and narrate your response
                        out loud. If you're playing with others, switch off between each line. -Where do you take a date
                        you're really excited by? What do they wear? What about you? -It goes well. Of course it does-they
                        are exquisite. What is your relationship like? -One day they need to leave. You're sad, but it's

                        We tell stories to explain and entertain. These stories are communal and change with the storytellers. Your job is to work
                        together, tell a story, and build a bond. There is no failure, only growth. Requirements: 3+ players
                        Pencil Paper 1d6 A coin Roll 1d6 to determine the type of story: 1- Explanation of world phenomena
                        2- Deity story 3- Trial of a hero 4- Creation story 5- World's end story 6- Trickster fable Begin
                        with the oldest player. Choose the setting and begin telling a story. Continue until a decision must
                        be made by a character. Flip the coin: heads, the decision has a positive outcome and leads to creation
                        or explanation. Tails, the decision has a negative outcome and leads to destruction or confusion.
                        Write down the coin flip and then make the decision. The next player continues the story until another
                        decision must be made. Repeat above rules. Repeat for every player. After each player has a decision
                        made in the story, refer to the number of flipped coins. If more positive outcomes or negative outcomes
                        were made, the beginning player ends the story with a positive ending or negative ending, respectively.

                        IMPORTANT: Before play, please have a frank conversation about safety, boundaries, and comfort. Your characters are in a
                        relationship and have just had sex. Describe your characters: How you look, how you smell, what you
                        are doing etc. For each other player, write on a notecard how your character felt about theirs throughout
                        the encounter and how that might change their relationship: (CHARACTER) made me feel/was (DESCRIPTION),
                        and I want to/that made me (REACTION). Tear up each notecard into 3 pieces, showing as equal amount
                        of information as possible. Note on each part who it relates to but keep them hidden. Then, taking
                        turns, pick a topic. Together play out or describe a scene of your characters addressing the topic:
                        talking, playing, teasing, touching. - A reflection on how we met - Gossip on a mutual friend's relationship
                        - Something significant that happened today - (Make some more up, I'm out of words) As the scene
                        plays out, when players agree that a moment of intimacy has been shared, they may each reveal one
                        piece of paper to each other and end the scene. Play until all pieces of paper are revealed, and
                        end by describing together what you each do afterward.

                        EVENT or imagined it. You are arguing about something that happened yesterday. What? Make a character
                        sheet listing these two memories: - Something you miss - Something you're glad you're rid of. And
                        one or more of the following - memories that give you: - confidence, - shame, - anxiety, - motivation.
                        As you argue, you may assert memories from your sheet as often as you like. When you assert a memory,
                        the other player FOLDs their character sheet. FOLDING: bring some portion of the blank back to cover
                        at least two letters but no more than half the words on the front. Write in the covered areas to
                        modify your affected memories. Memories asserted were part of the argument notwithstanding later
                        modifications on paper. Choose one memory to be SECRET from the other person. Both players FOLD when
                        a SECRET is asserted. Regardless how the SECRET changes, it remains secret until you assert it. The

                        Best played with a group of strangers meeting for the first time. FOMO stands for "fear of missing out." FOMO: The Game is
                        about the anxieties and insecurities proffered by social media. To play: each player needs a cell
                        phone and an Instagram account. Designate one player as the "Homebody." They will briefly describe
                        a reason why they couldn't make it out last night and then give the rest of the players a brief prompt
                        in the following format: "I hope I didn't miss _____________." All other players have 1 minute to
                        search Instagram for an image related to that prompt (interpreted as widely or narrowly as they wish).
                        They will then use the image to tell a story to the Homebody about the epic experience they missed.
                        The Homebody awards a point to the player whose story inspires the most FOMO. That player gets a
                        bonus point if their photo came from their own personal Instagram account. Play continues with every
                        player rotating into the role of the Homebody at least twice. The player who has the most points
                        at the end of the game wins. Everyone else must now follow their account for at least one month.

                        I wanted to make a game about how the pleasures of social media can transform into a feeling of anxiety about the self that
                        we are presenting to others. The joy that we feel in sharing our lives with our friends is transforming
                        into a need to curate an online persona. Our desire to have fun experiences is becoming dwarfed by
                        our desire to create images of ourselves having experience that look fun. FOMO: The Game is an opportunity
                        for players to think about the image that they present to others, the assumptions that they make
                        about what images others want to see, and the compromises that they make on behalf of these anonymous
                        observers. If you want to chat about the game, have any suggestions for additional rules, or want
                        to play with me online, you can find me on Instagram at megancondis or hit me up on Twitter @MeganCondis.

                        The forest grows darker. You can't remember what you lost, anymore. You see differently through these

                        red and play it against one Reader draws from black. Highest number wins, on tie redraw. A bigger
                        numerical difference = greater result. Players take actions until Reader decides the Hardship is
                        resolved and next Hardship is drawn. Protagonists: may force a redraw from their character card's
                        color deck once per game. Jacks get +1 to one draw per Hardship. Queens get +3 to one draw once per
                        game. Kings can draw 1 additional card once per game. Aces can force a Hardship redraw once per game.

                        Objective: To create a Blair Witch style Hangout recording of scared players in the woods. Pick an outdoor location where
                        you feel safe in the dark. Make sure you are not trespassing. Pick a game that requires no equipment.
                        Install a dice app on your phone if needed. Have one player record the hangout on a PC before moving
                        to their outdoor location. Remember to use your phone's flashlight when moving in the dark. Bring
                        a backup flashlight. Make sure you can afford an hour of video. Start Playing the game. Keep trying
                        as people get scared or lost. If you hear anything, get scared and ask if anyone heard it. Quickly
                        Look around with your phone's flashlight. If you lose connection walk to a new location and run in
                        place. Describe what scared you when reconnected. Disconnect if anyone approaches you. Assure them
                        you are playing a game. Follow the previous step after they leave. Quit If you phone dies, permanently
                        loses connection, or you want to leave. The last player must record a final message. Before disconnecting
                        describe how scared you are, why you are sorry and what you want someone to know if they find this
                        recording.

                        interweave. You are not alone. ... Rest, release your burdens. You have a warm loaf of bread and
                        plenty to drink. Take a small piece of bread-- Speak one sentence accounting a single previously
                        unspoken detail of your journey; your companions want to know your story: - a trial failed/ongoing/overcome
                        - a moment of gladness/shame - a destination of security/dread - a personal change --Eat your bread;
                        fortify your soul. Each companion in turn gives a one-word encouragement, then drinks to your health.
                        You are not alone. Break some bread for your next companion, who will then speak and eat as you have,
                        and break bread for the next companion in turn. Listen. Respond. Grow. This continues until the bread
                        is wholly eaten. Then you may freely discuss each other's stories. ... As you carry on this arduous
                        pilgrimage, take heart. Sustain yourself with daily bread, and remember this night with your companions
                        who fortify your soul. You are not alone.

                        The World in the middle. Distribute the remaining roles. Each player writes one detail for the World,

                        sets a machination in motion. Describe how you will change one of the world's details for the worse.
                        If no-one steps up, the change happens. Erase and replace the old detail. If someone steps up to
                        Challenge The Darkness, it takes a toll. The Challenger says how they strike a blow that changes

                        and replace their chosen detail. Otherwise the Challenger must back down after one minute's negotiation.
                        Resolve three machinations, then change your roles. The Eldest succumbs. Destroy their card and give
                        them the Darkness role. Erase and replace the word "Battlescarred" with "Eldest." "Neophyte" becomes
                        "Battlescarred." The cardless ex-Darkness player creates a new Neophyte. Play until each player has

                        the Competitor can defend their Action, they proceed, otherwise they give a Token to the challenger.

                        with other characters and with Fate. You can spend 1 spirit to add one ability dice to your roll

                        You are a dashing and noble thief. Describe yourself. Embellish everything. Use a deck of playing cards, remove the faces
                        and aces. Cards are rooms. Place the Ace of Diamonds. That room has The Prize. Place face-down cards
                        in rows of 3 beneath the Ace. 5 rows is a good size. Start below the last row, any column. Whoever
                        politely refuses to go first the most, goes first. You get one move per turn, orthogonally. When
                        you move into a room, turn it face-up. Describe the danger. To move out of a room, roll 2d6 higher
                        than the number. Rolling under is a suave failure. Regardless, gesture politely to a thief who hasn't
                        gone this round. They go next. You all are honorable thieves. Everyone in a room rolls when anyone
                        rolls. Narrate how you graciously assist. If anyone succeeds, each may leave at their next opportunity.
                        Take The Prize by entering a room with it, or by starting your turn in a room with it. If you have
                        The Prize and fail a roll, you still move, but drop The Prize behind. Damn. Leave where you entered
                        with The Prize to win. Be ruthlessly polite and politely ruthless.

                        A pervasive roleplaying game for 5+ people. You are all Agents. Gather in a public space and go about your business, keeping
                        an eye on each other. Suddenly, an earpiece squawks. One of you raises a hand to their ear to listen.
                        Everyone else, if you see a fellow Agent raise their hand to their ear, do the same and say "Copy"
                        loudly. Any Agent may instead say "Negative," causing all hands to be dropped. No Agent may do this
                        twice in a row. When all but one Agent has raised their hand, those Agents shout "GET DOWN, MR. PRESIDENT",
                        and proceed to take the remaining player to the ground (agree beforehand on how physical this should
                        be) before hurriedly escorting them out of them room. If the remaining Agent is female, everyone
                        must instead shout "BUT THE EMAILS" and run around like idiots. Repeat as many times as you want.

                        are elderly residents in a small town retirement home watching the New Year's Eve countdown and reminiscing.

                        are bittersweet memories. Swirl marbles are joyful memories. Players may roleplay memories, particularly
                        if other players' characters are involved, or may describe them. Place drawn marbles in the center
                        of the chalk circle until the bag is empty. Players close their eyes and aim the shooter toward the
                        marbles in the circle three times. Any marble that leaves the circle is now a memory lost based on
                        marble type. If a character no longer has that type of memory to lose, they will begin to forget
                        family members, profession, location, etc. A final New Year's Eve should occur afterward, where characters
                        attempt to reminisce, but some memories come more readily, while others seem lost to time.

                        what it's like to be a (very) pre-verbal newborn? Someone at the con mentioned this challenge, and
                        I was glad I still had some time to enter.. Since actual newborns are very limited, I gave them telepathy,
                        but only with each other. It was a lot of fun to think about how the world might seem to a brand-new
                        human. What might a baby say to another baby? How effective is crying to get what you want from adults?
                        When will you see your parents again? Could a newborn really escape an incubation room with enough
                        determination?

                        Players play the role of a feral dog. Players draw three cards and pick a character (only one of each). Brute - Subdues any
                        man or dog Smart - Opens unlocked doors, plays dead Mobile - Faster than anything, climbs Scrappy
                        - Starts with 6 cards. Charms humans. Difficult actions not in your character niche require a check
                        (ie, killing another dog, escaping gunfire). GM draws a card, and player must discard enough cards
                        to match or exceed it (facecards = 10; aces = 1). Nearby PCs can play a card to help. Drawn cards
                        go to discard pile that's shuffled back in whenever players get food. 1 food = draw 1 card No cards
                        = dead dog For GM: Before play, lay out grid of 12 cards. Each is an urban block. On face cards,
                        lay another. King - Armed man; hunts humans not of his suit Jack - human corpse (8 food) Queen -
                        burning ruins Joker - water Value indicates amount of item Hearts - hidden food Spades - pack of
                        hungry dogs Clubs - unarmed humans Diamonds - park/lot Other dogs and humans may be friend or foe.
                        Humans hunt maneaters. Remember that PC dogs: -can't read -see black and white -have dog's nose and
                        hearing -understand body language, not words

                        My goal was to create a game with enough depth for multiple sessions, and a bit of setting material to get things started.
                        The great thing is, most of us know enough about dogs to improvise from there! I imagine this game
                        playing little bit like an old school dungeon crawler. There's some basic resource management, and
                        even a chance of factions developing if you use the city generator. I blog about OSR stuff at gorgomormo.blogspot.com

                        to impede other Kyle's from talking.) Every Kyle must tell us about their entire day. There is no
                        order in which a Kyle can speak because every Kyle is above the law. If you laugh or fart, you lose.
                        The game is over when all the balloons are out of air at the same time or if every other Kyle has
                        given up by saying "Good night, Kyle." If a Kyle's balloon is out of air. A Kyle can refill their

                        GPS Pursuit You are a spy, a criminal, a bank robber... it doesn't matter. You need to reach the safe house in the next 30
                        minutes before others can stop you and bring you in for questioning. Get in your car and set your
                        GPS to a known destination of your choice. Start driving. As you drive, the GPS will tell you which
                        route to take - DO NOT TAKE THIS ROUTE! Your enemies are waiting for you there and will catch you
                        if you follow your GPS' directions. Take alternate routes. As soon as the GPS calculates another
                        route and announces it, get off that road and change routes. When you are within 500 metres of your
                        final destination, you can continue to drive on that road. If you cannot reach your final destination
                        within 30 seconds, you must get off that road and try again. When you get out of your car, hit the
                        button on your keys to lock the doors. This will cause the car to explode and allow you to make your
                        escape. If you need to be reminded to drive safe, you should not play this game or have a driver's
                        licence.

                        setting, location, and provides a map. Suggested genres include; horror, action, fantasy, or mystery.
                        Guards have genre appropriate equipment. ----------Stats---------- Take playing cards, draw 2 for
                        each stat, can exchange. Face-cards = 10: Move, Spot, Fight, Willpower. ----------Classes---------
                        Trainee - Move +3, Fight +1, Use 2 cards for action. Spotter - Move +1, Spot +3, see GM cards first.
                        Sergeant - Spot +1, Willpower +3, 1 action, locate anything. Armed - Fight +3, Willpower +1, replace
                        picked card after reveal, discard old card. -----------Play----------- Give players one 13 card suit.
                        GM has full deck. 6 actions/hour. When GM needs an action, participating players pick 1 card (or
                        none), add stat, can work together. GM picks 2 randomly/player, wins ties. Reveal cards simultaneously.
                        Highest score succeeds, losers take difference to stat and Willpower. Discard revealed cards to "pile,"
                        shuffle. Winners describe action. At 0 Willpower lose all cards. Guard faints for 1 hour unless rescued
                        by another guard, regains all Willpower. Guards randomly draw 3 cards from "pile" each hour or 1

                        scene, which must outline: where it is happening, who is the victim, what did they hope for (first
                        list) and what is going to happen (second list). Draw a new part of the symbol. - When did you start
                        believing in fascism? - Why did you vote for them? - How did you support the party? - Why did you
                        think the war was right? Fascist: end the scene explaining how you, your soldiers and the victim
                        got there and why, for the first time, you thought it was: - necessary to silence a dissident - imperative
                        to kill - important to execute a child - right to rape and you didn't prevent it. Stain the symbol
                        with drawings inspired by the scene. --- Exchange roles, mark the used questions and continue till

                        a threat. Flip and shuffle the cards. Write a FATE on each: murderer, traitor, lover, king, outcast.
                        Take turns to tell what your character do and say to fulfill his/her AMBITION. If it seems risky
                        or uncertain, invoke the Chorus: all other players must loudly argue of the character's virtues,
                        of the laws of Fate, and decide together what the consequences will be. * Once you revealed to someone

                        products. You'll be playing them alongside a helpless consumer. Whoever comes up with their vendor
                        first then plays the first consumer. The consumer describes a problem they've encountered and are
                        helpless to combat on their own. If you aren't sure what to say. Try "Has this ever happened to you?"
                        Everyone else gets a chance to pitch the consumer a product as their vendor, in the form of an informercial,
                        that will help with the problem. The consumer can choose to change the channel if a pitch is going
                        on for too long, moving on. Once each vendor has made their pitch, the consumer splits up $100 among
                        the vendors, how much they're willing to pay for the products. These are basically points. Consider
                        each consumer to have each product they properly paid for though. The consumer then chooses the next
                        consumer from players who haven't gone. Once everyone's been a consumer, the current round ends.
                        Play for as many rounds as you want but the money awarded doubles each round, and problems should
                        be more dramatic.

                        Objective: Score as many dates as possible. (And explore new perspectives!) Set-up: Players write
                        down something people hate on an index card. Mix up the cards and randomly select a card. (You may
                        draw your own.) Brainstorm all the positive qualities of the hated thing. Fold the index card to
                        hide the hated thing and on a blank side write a name for yourself. Characters must personify the
                        hated thing, but keep their true identity a secret. Play: Pair up (if an odd number of players, one
                        person will time each round). SPEED DATE! Rotate through each possible pairing. Spend 3 minutes talking
                        with each other character. Track dates on the blank side of the folded index card. Put a check by
                        characters your persona would like to go on a date with. Ending: At the conclusion of the dates,
                        calculate points. Each check mark is worth 1 point for that character. Mutual checks are worth 2
                        points for both characters. Highest score wins. Only after all checks have been counted may characters
                        reveal their true identities!

                        cards. Whenever a player performs an action, they draw a card to determine their character's motivation
                        for the upcoming action based on the suit and value, from 2 low to Ace high. The value determines
                        how well the action was executed, not the outcome. Heart is acting from the heart. Diamond is acting
                        logically. Spade is acting for personal gain. Club is acting for the group. For example, I notice
                        a mysterious silhouette and draw a Diamond 10. I could take my time (10) to analyze and identify
                        (Diamond) the object. If I drew a Club 2, I clumsily (2) report to the group (Club) about the mysterious
                        object. The game is over when the cards run out. The player who drew the most cards chooses another
                        player to tell the ending. Alternatively, this system can be used as a supplement to more traditional
                        RPGs as well. Players draft 13 cards to draw from and reshuffles after every draw. When players have
                        great RP, the GM can give card upgrades (Spade 2 to 3) or a new card associated with the RP.

                        Gain a soul any time you run over a human. Any time you attempt to overcome an obstacle, avoid God's
                        Police, or run over humans, roll 3d6. -If you didn't roll any 1s, you succeed. -If you rolled any
                        1s, you crash and lose HP equal to your highest rolled die. -You can consume a soul to re-roll a
                        die that isn't a 1. You start with 6 HP. When your HP is 0, you are considered a Junker. Any time
                        you would lose HP as a Junker, curse and choose a Demonic Driver to lose it instead. You can consume
                        6 souls to regain 1 HP. If all players are Junkers, God's Police capture you and the game is over.
                        If anyone rolls three 6s, you find the highway to hell and deliver souls to Satan. Whoever delivers
                        the most souls wins.

                        fantastical adventure stories. The first player takes a piece of paper and describes, in at most

                        happening (Cave-in, tsunami, tornado of dentists, etc...) The paper is passed to the next player,
                        who has 5 lines, in character, to continue the tale and permanently defeat/nullify two of the threats
                        and temporarily avoid/hide from/narrowly escape a third. The whole party must escape/win/survive

                        describing the party's next 3 obstacles in the same way. Repeat around circle. Once everyone has
                        added to the story, unfold the paper and dramatically read the epic tale out loud.

                        WELCOME TO OUR LEGO VILLAGE. We've had SOME PROBLEMS RECENTLY and you're invited to a series of town meetings where we'll
                        clear the air. Requirements: 3+ players, a pile of Legos, a few dozen tokens, a timer and 45 minutes.
                        Setup: Set a timer for 10 minutes. Players should use this time to construct a home of their dreams.
                        Afterward ready or not, hand each player 6 social tokens to indicate their standing in the community,
                        and we'll begin. Now we're going to hold 3 meetings. During each meeting, players should... 1. Bring
                        up a grievance about another player. 2. Participate in the discussion about player's grievances.
                        3. Hand out at least two social tokens to other players to indicate their support. Between meetings,
                        players may make changes to their houses. At the end of 3 meetings, the player(s) with the most social
                        points will decide how the community was destroyed.

                        As a group, decide on genre, location, and danger. Introduce your character with: Name, two truths,

                        yourself. -Something about them. -Something about another player. (You may never voice full responsibility.)

                        loses. Players narrate the ending from their perspective. Anybody not touching palms with someone?
                        Danger claims that player. That player narrates their ending. End of game: Are all palms touching?
                        Players have forgiven each other. Danger climaxes, but everybody wins. Players narrate forgiveness
                        and ending from their perspective.

                        societal strata, cells are "spots". Draw cards for turn order, then each pick a spot to flip and

                        It's stated as a summary of one life in a Spot. If two players conflict, the Family Stats are compared.
                        A tie is broken by everyone voting on which story was best. When the map is exposed the most tokens

                        The players are honorable creatures of the realm. They fight evil and corruption in whatever form. The GM will start by writing
                        the first aspect of the realm. Then, each player writes one more. These aspects are true and are
                        what makes the realm a dangerous place. The creatures have one attribute. Honor. It starts at 5.
                        It's maximum is 10. It's minimum is 1. Everytime there's conflict or something to overcome, the player(s)
                        roll percentage. Look at the result of the d10. If the result is above his honor, it's a success.
                        Raise honor by one. On a 10, raise it by two. If the result is below his honor, it's a failure. Lower
                        honor by one. On a 1, lower it by two. If a creature's honor reaches 1 they are taken by the corruption
                        of the realm. If the percentage result is a 1, the creature is instantly corrupted, but if it is
                        a 100, his action creates an aspect in the realm. It can be whatever the player wants. An aspect
                        should negate another aspect, but it can´t negate more than one. The adventure ends when there's
                        only one aspect.

                        The Facilitator for this adventure chooses one of the Four Horsemen: War, Famine, Pestilence or Death.
                        Then, the rest of the players say what the horseman did to earn their ire, and describe your character.
                        Together, each of you tell the story of how the world ends. Share the spotlight, with each of you
                        getting a chance to speak. When you want to do anything, say what your goal is, and how you do it.
                        You start with 1d6. If you are using a object from the hotel, +1 to your roll. If the plan is daring
                        or bold, +1 to your roll. +1 if the plan takes an advantage of a debility. -1 for each debility you
                        have. 1-3: You gain a debility and describe how the world gets worse. 4-5: Your Target gains a debility,
                        or you get what you want, at a price 6+: You succeed fully. The game ends when you either kill the

                        of rooms, location, etc. Your budget: 29. Each player writes features for each card in a suit (aces
                        -> 10). Low = bad, high = good. Suits: Hearts: House features (garden, tiny kitchen) Diamonds: location
                        (transports, sketchy) Clubs: agency/landlord (expenses, helpfulness) Spades: Bad. Just bad. (mould,
                        mice, corpse in the cellar) Each turn, deal 4 to each player. 4 cards = a house. Read the features
                        to describe it. House cost = total card values. If you draw a face card, put it aside and draw again.
                        Play faces for special effects: Queen: discard a card, draw again. King: Replace a card with any
                        value Knight: Switch 2 cards' positions Turn end: Decide which houses to keep. You cannot have more
                        than 4. Build a house of cards with the discards. When it falls, or you finish the deck, time's up:

                        Hunter, you must understand its capabilities (power source, special abilities, weaknesses), then
                        exploit them. To begin play, narrate the buildup of horror with the GM. Describe how some of your
                        friends died and who the Hunter is stalking right now.

                        Beasts rise from the Darkness to consume humanity's Light. Light defends itself by Illuminating human Hunters, granting them
                        a Gift. Someone is Guide and sets scenes and controls the Beast. Others run Hunters and pursue the
                        Beast. Hunters: Write a phrase describing your humanity, and one describing your Gift. You have 5
                        Light. If you lose all Light, you go Dark and join the Beast. Guide: Write a phrase describing the
                        form of the Beast. White a phrase describing the Hunger of the Beast - physical, conceptual, or spiritual.
                        When Hunters act and the Beast opposes them, Hunters roll 2d6 and add 1 if their humanity helps,
                        add 2 if their Gift applies. Beast rolls 2d6 and add 1 if its form helps and 2 if its Hunger applies.
                        If Hunters roll higher than the Beast, they succeed and the Beast Loses Darkness. If they fail, they
                        lose Light. Narrate how. The Beast has 4 Darkness +1 per Hunter per scene. If reduced to zero, it
                        is Discovered, Cornered, or Defeated. Set Scenes, ask questions, challenge humanity: Hunters DISCOVER
                        the Beast and its Hunger as it feeds. Hunters PURSUE the Beast, it flees. Hunters CONFRONT the Beast,
                        it fights.

                      <code>
                        === INTRODUCTION === You are a cat and you are hungry. You suddenly smell food and turn the corner of an alley to find some
                        other cats have done the same. All of you gather and begin to plot. === PREPARATION === Using small
                        tokens, give each player three to start their collection and add three more to the central Food Pile.
                        Add three additional tokens to the Food Pile per player for a minimum of three and up to a maximum
                        of six total players. === PLAY === Play starts with the player who last ate food and proceeds clockwise.
                        On their turn, the player must consume (remove from play) one token from either: their own collection;
                        the central Food Pile; or any other player's food collection. If a player no longer has food in their
                        own collection, even on another player's turn, they are out of the game. Play continues until only
                        one cat remains. === STRATEGY === Remember: hungry cats don't share food! You can play conservatively,
                        but other players may not. They may even turn on you! Alliances can be formed and broken at any time.
                        Only one cat can win!

                        strange, like an alien. Player : One detective, at least 3 neighbors Cut 50 (or more) pieces of papers
                        and write on each of them a word used often in everyday life ("Eat", "Sorry",etc...) Each neighbors
                        pick randomly five papers, without showing them. Take from a deck one card for each neighbors, minus
                        one. Add to the pile the joker card. Each neighbors pick one at random, without showing it. Whoever
                        picks the joker is the alien. The detective will ask questions to each neighbor, about their everyday

                        In my original idea, the alien was some kind of parasite going from body to body. The idea was, after several questions,
                        the cards were shuffled and the alien was another neighbor. But I'm not sure it was a good idea (and,
                        you know, the word limit and all that)

                        I wanted to try and create an RPG that you could play anywhere, anytime (no need for pencils/paper/dice/etc.), fuelled purely
                        (as most RPGs largely are!) by the relationship at hand being explored. I was curious how our opinions
                        of people change both as we reminisce and learn new things about them, and the ways this influences
                        our interactions. I hope this game provokes some of this - and is enjoyable! Thanks to JP Hung and

                        You all are Iki, a minuscule humanoid creature. You play a number of moments in Iki's one-day lifespan, in order: childhood
                        1 adolescence 2 adulthood 3 maturity 2 decline 1 One player describes one moment of Iki's life, a...
                        ...thing seen / heard / tasted / touched ...person met / creature encountered ...action taken / goal
                        attempted They then grab a BlackDie if they see this moment as challenging, difficult, painful. Or
                        a WhiteDie if it is beautiful, hearthwarming, joyous. Another player expands this moment describing
                        how things around Iki look, feel, behave, and then grabbs a b/w die themselves. Repeat until six
                        dice are grabbed, then roll and sum them up by color. BlackScore > WhiteScore = write down one positive
                        or useful Quality of Iki's personality BlackScore
                        < WhiteScore=w rite down
                          one Treasured memory from Iki 's experience
BlackScore = WhiteScore	the color with less dice wins

Play a new moment.
If possible, spend an unspent Quality / Treasure to inspire it.
Continue until all of Iki's nine life moments have played out. Look back at it all and discuss: how did Iki die? what influence
                          did Iki have on other 's lives?
which mark did Iki leave in the world?
did Iki's life have worth and meaning? </code>

                            This game was inspired by the "Petalars" story, from the 2011 Thundercats reboot. It then got mixed with the "Bosco Piccolo"
                            campaign for the FateLess game system I played with Claudia Colini, Antonio Amato and Luca Maiorani;
                            I still thank them for that incredible experience. For this design I want to thanks my beloved
                            Claudia. She always shies away from "design stuff" but I keep pestering her because, like in
                            this case, she can have awesome ideas. Ron Edward's game SPIONE also helped me a lot in coming
                            up with the overall play structure and style of player contribution.

                            SETUP Deal seven cards per player from a standard deck. Each player arranges three cards (left, top, and right) to indicate
                            their relationships and one at bottom as personal outlook. Hold the other cards. PLAY Lowest
                            ranked outlook goes first. On your turn draw a card, then play a card: (1) Build relationship
                            by playing onto your side of your relationship a card (not an Ace) matching suit * or beating
                            rank of the other side's latest card in that relationship. (2) End relationship by playing onto
                            either side of any relationship an Ace matching suit * of a royal (KQJ) card that is also the
                            latest card on that side. (3) Change outlook by playing onto your outlook a card to replace it.
                            * You may always play cards matching your outlook's suit or rank. NARRATION During setup and
                            play, narrate your relationships according to the cards: Hearts are emotional bonds and romance;
                            Clubs are social affiliations and recreation; Diamonds are financial ties and family; Spades
                            are intellectual affinities and work. ENDGAME Stop after three relationships end or the deck

                            player made, up of 3 more cards than there are players. Make one hand (the infected) of 3 black
                            cards and the rest red. The remaining hands are all black. Randomly distribute the hands. The
                            person who last watched "The Thing" starts. Declare your job on the ship. Roleplay a scene with
                            any other player. At the end of the scene trade 1-3 cards with the other player. Take turns clockwise.
                            You cannot trade away your last red card. Once infected, always infected. Interact with someone

                            to kill another character, each player selects and reveals a card. Highest card wins. Aces are

                            I've always enjoyed horror movies and RPGs. I love games in which things go badly, and people get the chance to do horrible
                            things to each other. Great horror games have a mechanic that encourages or rewards this type
                            of behavior. In a truly great horror movie, nobody survives.

                                woman named Esther who must go on an adventure to accomplish her goal. The first player decides

                                (minimum initial score: -1, maximum: +2). An action is described by "I want to [Intent],

                                by the previous character, or the last intent used by the same character.

                                Gamemaster: - Take a chess-board. - Pick start and endpoint of dungeon. - Decide whether
                                high or low is good. Only tell the Irrlicht. - When Irrlicht rolls: Good roll - give a right

                                It Came from Studio 9 is a GM-less RPG where 3-5 players are part of a crew making a B-Movie. The crew collaborates on the
                                framework of a science fiction, horror, or adventure movie before producing a film in three
                                acts. Players then choose one of the following roles in the movie's production: Director
                                (Required) Location Scout Lead Actor (Required) Supporting Actor Stunt Person Players then
                                film the scenes in each act (usually two or three) by taking turns to say what they're doing
                                in each scene. If the action seems difficult, they must roll 2d6 to determine the result.
                                10+: Action is a success (Ex: Lead actor delivers a great performance) 7-9: Action is successful
                                but there's a complication (Ex: Location Scout gets the beach they wanted but there's turtles
                                everywhere) 6-: The movie has a disaster (Ex: Director couldn't get prop guns and actors
                                now must fight killer birds with coat hangers) After all three acts are completed, the movie
                                is released and the group discusses if it was a huge success, box office bomb, or film that
                                is so bad it's a cult classic.

                                "It's a Hologram" is a collaborative combat card game (CCCG) for four or more players - all you need is a standard deck of
                                playing cards. Begin by shuffling the deck and dealing one card to each player until no cards
                                remain. The player whose last name is alphabetically first starts the game, playing any of
                                their cards face-up on the table and saying an attack: "I strike with my blade," "I cast
                                Dank Cloud," etc. Any first-turn attack is valid so long as the group deems it a "level 1
                                attack" by their metric. The player to the right goes next, playing face-up any card that
                                is immediately above or below the previous card in numerical or royal value. After saying
                                "Ay!", the player must then say how they counter the previous attack: "I block with my shield,"
                                "I cast Soul Barrier," etc. Any counter-attack is valid so long as the group deems it not
                                to be a gross overreaction to the previous attack. No attack or counter-attack can be used
                                more than once! Therein lies the rub! Players are eliminated as they run out of cards, and
                                the game ends when no cards remain. There is no win condition.

                                how. The slighted explains why they cannot forgive the slight; the price must be blood. Everyone
                                else say why they won't allow the unavenged death of someone who's spoken. Everyone choose
                                what you wield and what sways you: Mortality. Propriety. Sentimentality. Cash. Start with
                                three gold. Together, tell the story of how it all goes down. Share the spotlight and who
                                gets to say what. Spend gold anytime to have hardware, a connection, or put 2d4 goons in
                                someone's way. When you try to kill someone take 1d6 plus: +1d6 if your hardware's features
                                aid you. -1d6 if your hardware's features hinder you. +1d6 for each injury they have. Roll
                                the d6s, keep the highest. On 6, you kill them. On 4-5 they gain an injury. On 1-3 you gain
                                an injury. When you bargain with someone, speak as your character and try swaying them by
                                invoking what you wield. Remember what sways you. If things aren't resolving, just murder
                                them. It's all over when everyone is satisfied or dead.

                                Separate a deck of cards into piles: reds (traps), blacks (tunnels), and jokers (prisoners). You will eventually be faced
                                with an array of face-down cards and one face-up starting tunnel card. To win, you will have
                                to find a path through the cards, moving across edges that touch, and free both prisoners.
                                Begin at the starting tunnel, and if you move onto a card that isn't face-up, flip it over.
                                If you encounter a trap, you die and utterly fail your quest. With the cards in piles and
                                these facts in mind, lay out an array of face-up cards such that there is an uninterrupted
                                tunnel path between the prisoners and a starting tunnel of your choice, attempting to make
                                the prisoners as hard to free as possible. You don't have to use all the cards, and implied
                                touching of edges is an acceptable substitute for precise alignment. Then, flip all the cards
                                over except for the starting tunnel. Spend roughly five minutes doing something engaging
                                enough to take your mind from the arrangement you just made. Then attempt to free the prisoners,
                                and see when you won. Playing best of several rounds is encouraged to enjoy counterplay.

                                One of you is a spy. The other two are your handlers -- or claim to be. You've been hit with an experimental compound by
                                a group that's infiltrated your agency, looking to subvert it for their own goals -- or so
                                they say. They're saying lots of things, though. Like that the other is lying. Like that
                                the other is an infiltrator. You have a pounding headache. And both of them at gunpoint.
                                You can only manage ten questions -- ten questions to decide which of them is telling the
                                truth about being your handler, which of them should be eliminated as a threat to your organisation.
                                Ten questions, while the building is falling down around your ears. When the spy has asked
                                5 questions, handlers each secretly flip a coin -- heads, and you're not an infiltrator.
                                Tails, you are. Keep this secret from the other players. Answer the final five questions
                                as convincingly as you can. When the spy has chosen who to believe, and who to eliminate,
                                the still living handler should narrate briefly what happens next. Reveal if you were truly

                                find out what you feel/want. Is it a crush? Friendship? Love? The Code: never speak about
                                your feelings/desires/vulnerabilities. If you're asked or would like to, keep up your facade.

                                I don't want to explain what this game is about or what it means because I feel like that's the job of the players, to discover
                                their own meaning in games, but I will say a few things: This game owes a lot to the fourth
                                season of Friends at the Table. I've read lots of books and seen plenty of movies, but no
                                creative work has ever affected me in the way that Friends at the Table does. The reverence
                                the Friends have for their characters, the passion with which they represent and discuss
                                queer and racial politics in and out of character, and the love they have for one another
                                is moving and refreshing. I wouldn't have done this without them. If you played this game
                                and liked it/hated it/felt neutral about it, tweet at me! This was my first time designing
                                a game, and I had a lot of fun, so I'd love to get advice on what worked or didn't work in
                                case I end up writing more! Thanks to Joshua Flores from the Fans at the Table Facebook group
                                for reading through my game and giving me Confidence Alive to post it, good luck on your

                                pick a song that reflects their character and fits the decade. It gets added to the playlist.
                                Keep doing that until there are twelve songs on the playlist. Shuffle it. When everyone is
                                ready, they each grab 2d6. Hit play on the music. During one of the songs you chose, you
                                are the GM for the length of the song. You can introduce new problems, run the other attendees
                                at the party, and create challenges. Whenever you try to do something, you roll 2d6. You
                                have to roll equal to or more than the number of songs remaining. If you fail, it's because
                                of your Drama, so you're going to have to act out. When the music ends, narrate an epilogue.

                                leading questions. When it's clear why the rule was broken, end the conversation with "I've
                                got to go." Discard the rule or qualify it e.g "unless my life is at stake". Repeat until
                                all rules are discarded. Leave "I won't betray my partner" until last.

                                player loses. If the Narrators have chosen "real" and the player jumps then the player loses.
                                Never tell a player if they have won or lost, ever. Select a new player and repeat.

                                The Demon (GM) is an entity with empathy and perception so heightened it can interpret the cosmic vibrations of the universe.
                                This ability allows the Demon to "view" stories from all beings/cultures that have, or will,
                                exist. The characters are at a time and place of the Demon's choosing, e.g. 1920s Chicago
                                or a starship in the future inhabited by aliens. - The Demon determines - location - time
                                frame - scenario - Each player determines - Two good characteristics - One bad characteristic
                                - Position in scenario (e.g. detective, 1st mate, etc.) - Optional relationship to other
                                players After an initial scenario description, The Demon gives focus to a character. The
                                Demon controls focus by asking characters to narrate the scenario. The Demon may change focus
                                to any character at any time, but can never take it themselves. A character that has focus
                                describes their actions, thoughts, motivations as well as the environment, events, and/or
                                NPC's actions. Anytime a player describes an action the Demon may ask that character to roll

                                of 2 or 3 are decided randomly. Each group should have the same number of Hosts, unless the
                                size of the crowd is not divisible by 2 or 3. -Each group spends 10 minutes creating their
                                podcast together. They decide the high concept (potentially based on mutual passions and
                                interests), the title, and the topic of the episode. -The episode is Episode 10 of everyone's
                                podcast. Each group should act as if their podcast already has an established format, tagline,
                                and/or intro/outro phrases. -Each group takes turns improvising their 3-5 minute long abridged
                                episode, with the rest of the crowd as their audience. -After each group performs, each player
                                writes down which podcasts they would "Follow". Every player must vote for a minimum of two
                                podcasts (or one, if there are only three groups) and cannot vote for their own podcast.
                                The podcast with the most Follows wins!

                                tattoos. While most tattoos are purely decorative, some brave (or foolhardy) adventurers
                                may opt for tattoos of a more magical nature -- a ward, hex, glyph of summoning, or otherwise.
                                Some rumors speak of magical tattoos bursting into flames, rejecting the host and becoming
                                their own entity or other such mutations. -------- Players choose a name and grand title,
                                a dungeoneering profession, and a preferred late night snack (to eat while debating). Each
                                player lists tattoo ideas on (number of players) +1 separate slips of paper. All ideas are
                                placed into the pot. The person least likely to get a tattoo will be the first person to
                                pick from their party's suggestions. Everyone else picks two slips from the pot, and combines
                                them to make a base for their proposed tattoo design (elaboration is encouraged). To win
                                over your comrades, tie the design into your previous adventure. Each player pitches their
                                idea to their uncertain target. The player being pitched to must decide which of the pitches
                                they are be willing to get. Rotate and repeat until everyone has a commemorative tattoo.

                                This game is played in rounds. At the start of the game, one player takes the role of the Archmage for the first round. At
                                the start of each round, the archmage uses a random word generator to generate (10 + number
                                of players) each of nouns, verbs and adjectives. The archmage then narrates a problem that
                                the players must solve. Players take turns describing how they would solve the problem by
                                creating a spell using the words generated for that round. Each spell must be created out
                                of one or two nouns, one or two verbs, and up to two adjectives. Adverbs, conjunctions and
                                punctuation may be added to the spell name for free. Example: "penetrate critical system"
                                could be a spell that hacks computers. Players act in the order of whoever comes up with
                                an idea first. Players acting after the first in each round cannot re-use nouns, verbs and
                                adjectives used by earlier players. After all players have taken their turn, the archmage
                                chooses a winner based on who's spell would have most effectively solved the problem. That
                                person is the archmage next round. First player to win three rounds wins the game.

                                Setting All players are powerful wizards on an adventure run by a GM. Each PC should have a dictionary in front of them,
                                which is their "spellbook" for the game. Wordplay Wizards cannot do anything other than cast
                                spells from their spellbook for all actions. To act, the player flips to a random page and
                                blindly drops their finger onto a word. They must then use that word as the key term in a
                                spell for the situation. Example: Encountering a locked door, they may randomly select "vadose"
                                (underground water), which (per the player) causes a geyser to erupt, which shatters the
                                door. Failure If the PC is unable to work up a solution with their word, the spell fails
                                and they suffer the consequences. The GM takes the same page, and selects any word as punishment.
                                Example: The GM looks at the page, sees "vamoose", and tells the PC they run away in fear.
                                Power Words Once per session, a player may choose to cast a Power Word, which allows them
                                to select any one word from a random page. This allows the PC a bit more leeway for an appropriate
                                spell when it really counts!

                                I actually use random words from the dictionary as NPC inspiration. Always thought random words could be used as spell components,
                                so I created a small RPG using this as the mechanic for a spellcaster-centric game.

                                goal is to gain and keep rank. Every few years, a young noble debuts at court. One player
                                draws a card (this is the noble's rank), and describes their name and achievements, and this
                                year's festive contest (e.g. archery, poetry, feasting). Successfully courting a noble gives
                                a character +1 rank. Marrying them gives a player character their exact rank. When the outcome
                                of a character's action is disputed, or they are trying to court someone, their player draws
                                a card. A result less than the appropriate attribute is a success. Rank decides ties. Each
                                character who wins/loses a contest gains/loses one point of the appropriate attribute. At
                                the end of each debut, all player player characters increase their Bitterness by 1 and decrease
                                their Eligibility by 1. The declaration of the next debutante is done by the player on their

                                Make tea. Sit around a table with an extra chair. This was Katy's chair, but it's no more. You'll play scenes of the past
                                to find out why. You're Katy's Friend - a kid, puppet, or pet. Describe yourself through
                                Katy's eyes. PLAY SCENES Take turns at framing scenes regarding Katy's discomfortable events.
                                Take a sip of tea to play the scene in character, otherwise play it out-of-character. PLAY
                                IN CHARACTER You did your best to help Katy. Your acts against Katy's discomfort were successful,
                                provided another player agrees by taking a sip of tea. Another player can suggest a different
                                outcome instead: - you can take a sip of tea and agree; - or you can reveal something discomforting
                                about you in Katy's eyes: this made you successful and cuts the scene. The third time you
                                do this, you'll become a Monster to her. Monsters cannot succeed against discomfort unless
                                all other players takes a sip of tea. PLAY OUT-OF-CHARACTER Play Katy's reactions. Describe
                                the source of Discomfort: that's all that isn't a character. ENDGAME When most players have
                                finished their tea: - each Friend says something that Katy still remembers. - each Monster
                                says something that eventually drove her away.

                                can't refuse. Only duels are allowed. If somebody kills, takes 1 token. 1st Phase: Roll your
                                attributes with D100, valid throws are between 25 and 75. Three stats: Supernatural, Ugly,
                                Marvelous. 2nd: Timer starts and gives 5 minutes of immunity to all attendants to spread.
                                3rd: Challenge on! 5-85 minutes remaining to get as many tokens as you can. If you run out,
                                lose your symbol! Additional symbols increase your stats by 1 each. 4th Phase: Game ends,
                                back to base and count. Challenge: Both roll, higher starts. To fight: Attacker selects S
                                or U or M. Both roll a check on the selected attribute. Roll lower to succeed and sum the

                                    that feels peaceful. Tear the 4th sheet of paper in half and write "Minne" on one half,
                                    "Liebe" on the other. Players will play 2 knights (of any gender) and 1 maiden across
                                    3 different outdoor scenes. The knights are torn between feelings of courtly, spiritual
                                    love (Minne) and lustful, physical love (Liebe). The maiden can have any motivation the
                                    player chooses. Name these characters, and imagine their backstories. A scene may contain
                                    3 characters, but is always ultimately between 2 characters. Set the first scene in one
                                    of the drawn outdoor places. A character relaxes there, another arrives. Converse in
                                    lofty, poetic language: "Sire" "thou" "wherefore." Later, the player not in the scene
                                    points to "Minne" or "Liebe" once for each character, indicating the direction the scene
                                    should take. They can conflict. Both parties shall consent to an ending to the scene,
                                    and then draw their characters and that ending on that outdoor place. Do it again with
                                    each other outdoor place, resulting in 3 scenes and 3 drawings. Bow and clap.

                                    player then gets to tell their story to the Assembly. Other Souls may freely ask their
                                    questions. By the end of the story, everyone decides whether they'll back the storyteller
                                    and allow them to pursue their goal. The game lasts until everyone tells their story
                                    - only then some lucky Souls move on, while other remain waiting for more Souls to arrive...

                                    Standard 54-card deck. Red is loving. Black is dark. Shuffle face cards into their own deck -- the characters. (Other cards
                                    are events.) Turn two cards up: First, the head of the family. Second, their child. Deal
                                    each player three event cards. Tell the story of the family -- an oil dynasty, fantasy
                                    kingdom, your suburban neighbors, whatever -- as follows: On your turn, play a card from
                                    your hand to a family member, as long as it's at least as high as the highest event card
                                    already present there. If red, describe a loving event involving that character and another.
                                    If black, a dark one. Say why. Higher numbers means higher stakes. Play an Ace to kill
                                    any character. Play a Joker to discard all event cards from any character. Shuffle the
                                    Joker back in. Play again. If you can't play, expose a new character, if any remain.
                                    Narrate their connection (dark or loving) to the family, then draw three event cards.
                                    For events, a change of color may mean upheaval. A change of suit in the same color may
                                    be a change in direction. Play until events run out. Did dark characters meet dark ends?
                                    Did loving characters remain so?

                                    A game for two players. You'll play lovers hindered by their role in their family/clan/organization. Answer to create them:
                                    Who are you? Your family's duty? A secret your beloved ignores? Each player takes ten
                                    six sided dice and ten pieces of paper to write "This is a moment of...". (greed, bloodshed,
                                    an unwanted death, etc). Fold them and put in a bowl. You play scenes in turn until dice
                                    or cards run out. At the beginning of each scene draw 1-2 cards to set the scene focal
                                    point. Scene protagonist describes how his character acts, the other player makes and
                                    answer questions. Love and duty must be at stake at some point in each scene. Both players
                                    take a number of dice and roll. Player's highest die wins and decides the outcome (1-2
                                    bad, 3-4 expected, 5-6 best outcome, tie you collaborate), then the scene ends. As protagonist
                                    declare once how your secret is revealed to automatically win the stake, other character
                                    will react. At the end of the game play an extra scene together to describe how things
                                    wrap based on the outcomes of previous scenes. Will you finally choose duty or love?

                                    confession The love interest is not a character. Instead, as dates happen, characteristics
                                    will be applied to them. If a date has them at the gym, they might be fit, but the next
                                    date might contradict that by having the Love Interest do unfit things. If there are
                                    three contradictions, the Love Interest wins. The Love Interest baits contradictions,
                                    the active Suitor tries to move the date to the Confession, and the other Suitors ask
                                    questions to flesh out details. Once per date each other Suitor may possess the Love
                                    Interest to make them say or do something. After everyone confesses, the next set of
                                    scenes is performed. After the suitors have each confessed three times the Love Interest
                                    picks a winner.

                                    Players take on the role of the Fates as they play games with mortals' lives. ## Setup ## 1. Each player writes down a mortal's
                                    name, background, and secret goal. 2. One mortal (randomly selected) becomes the Chosen.
                                    3. Each player receives a set of 5 colored threads. ### Threads ### Red: Feeling Black:
                                    Loss Blue: Thought Brown: Order Green: Growth ## Contest ## Each Chosen's story is narrated
                                    by their Fate (player). Every story begins with the mortal gazing at their reflection
                                    (location determined by the Fate). The Chosen's background determines its skills. Fates
                                    can ask brief questions or use threads to influence story direction. If the Chosen does
                                    not accomplish their goal, their Fate loses. When the Chosen's season ends their goal
                                    is revealed, and a new Chosen is selected. When all seasons are complete, the Fates vote
                                    for the best story. ## Rules ## - Once a Fate uses a thread they must discard it for
                                    that season. - Fates cannot harm the Chosen (other mortals are fair game) - Fates must
                                    not disrupt the order of the present reality. A thread can crash a car not summon a dragon.
                                    - Fates cannot vote for their story. - Thread influences must match their color. - Seasons
                                    last 7 minutes.

                                    just like Minstrels sitting around the tavern fire. If you play with friends but are

                                    Everything is gray, except you and the figures around you. A Great Noir Detective has died, you are some aspect of them,
                                    a virtue, a sin, a characteristic, but you don't remember which. You play to find out.
                                    You find out by recalling memories. The oldest person in the group speaks first, followed
                                    by the person to their left, and so on. To recall a memory you roll a d6 and recount
                                    a moment that shaped, scarred, changed or healed the Detective. The subject of the memory
                                    is based on the result of the die. A "1" is something they said, a "2" is something they
                                    heard, a "3" is something they lost, a "4" is something they found, a "5" is something
                                    they did and a "6" is something or someone they failed. You may only speak for 10 minutes
                                    per memory. After each player has done this three times you end the game by introducing
                                    the aspect of the Detective you are based on your three memories. Example , "I am her
                                    Hope." or "I am his Guilt." You decide as a group what kind of person you were, and if
                                    you could do it again, would you?

                                    of the realm to solve magical matters too trivial for Merlin- rescuing maiden's from
                                    wyverns, solving disputes with the fey etc. Now, sorcerers like you solve all their problems
                                    and tasks with Magic, why else would they be a magician? You have a starting pool of
                                    50 Magic Points; this represents your spells and vitality. In order to cast a spell you
                                    must describe what Magic you wish to perform, and spend a number of Magic Points - for
                                    each point spent roll 1d6. 4 and above is a success, 3 and below is a fail. 6s explode
                                    into more dice, and rolling a 1 creates an unforeseen consequence to the magic. The more
                                    successes the better the spell. Your magic is limited to your theme. You pick a colour;
                                    the colour is your Warlock's theme, any/all Magic you do you must justify as being part
                                    of your theme. I.e. Red equals fire, anger, etc. You must also pick a mundane hobby,
                                    10 minutes doing this regains you 1d6 magic points.

                                    to sort things out! You'll need 3+ players, pen, notecards, and a six sided dice. 1.
                                    Each player designs a giant mecha! A giant mecha has two arms, two legs, and a head.
                                    Put each part on a separate notecard. Each part has one power or weapon. Be as creative
                                    or silly as you want. 2. Pass your mech to another player. Add a different weakness to
                                    each part. 3. Mix all the parts together, then each player recieves a random collection
                                    of five parts, two legs, two arms, one head. Return parts that belonged to you originally.
                                    4. Tear them apart! Players take turns narrating an attack with one of their parts, trying
                                    to remove an enemy part! Roll the die, Attacks knock off a part on a six or higher. Defenders
                                    should also state their reaction. Players not in combat give out bonuses or penalities
                                    to the roll as they deem appropriate: - Creativity - Exploit weakness - Previous part
                                    damage - Clever defenses - Dramatic speeches - Heroic determination - Witty oneliners
                                    Once removed parts can't be reattatched.

                                    demoralization tokens changes sides, taking warden-style turns thereafter. On someone

                                    This started as a game for two players, about monks fighting ghosts, inspired by the board game Ghost Stories. It's ended
                                    up as something different, and could probably use a few more words for clarity, but overall

                                    I've been working on a game system for a while, and this is the core of it stripped down to 200 words. The dice system is
                                    designed to reward more skilled characters, as you get better at a skill, it becomes
                                    easier to succeed with harder challenges, but also way more likely to succeed with easier
                                    ones. Whereas an unskilled character is almost guaranteed to fail on the more difficult
                                    (+1, +2) checks. This may have a side affect of keeping players focused, and not stepping
                                    on each others toes. (the barbarian picking the lock e.g.) The levelling system is designed
                                    to take the pain out of failure, and also as a simple and automatic mechanism for character
                                    advancement. Note that as you level, you fail a lot less, so although this looks linear,
                                    it gets progressively harder. In the fuller version, I have "modules" for magic, classes
                                    and species :)

                                    assist. -Match(es). -Fire-safe bucket. -Water (for emergency, hydration). One person
                                    plays a millennial Speaker (facilitator/leader). Others portray millennial elected officials.
                                    The player who last paid a government tax, toll, or fine goes first. The Speaker moderates
                                    each round. Length of each round determined by participants. Each participant must propose
                                    dismantling of 1+ institution (see list below). Speaker may use stopwatch/timer. Participants
                                    are encouraged to replace oppressive institutions with more specific establishments (corrupted
                                    democratic republic, failing healthcare system) or those affecting them directly. Each
                                    round may only continue when participants agree upon a solution for ruining that round's
                                    institution. Institutions: -Classism -Sexism -Racism -Heteronormativity -Ableism -Anti-transgenderism
                                    -Player choice -A government structure After each round, one participant illustrates
                                    a representation of the dismantled institution. When rounds are complete, players compile
                                    illustrations (hold up visibly if remote) and collectively burn them, shouting together
                                    "Millennials ruin everything!" Optional hydration mechanic: Participants may drink water
                                    after each round, representing necessary self-care and emotional labor required to dismantle

                                        BAM! You need a bunch of dice: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, and a black d12. POW! You are all minions of a supervillain, cannon fodder
                                        against the Batman. Choose a villain and assign a stupid villain-themed name to your

                                        to do an action, choose Brains if it's a thinky/smarts thing, Brawn if it's a physical
                                        thing, or Bwah-ha-ha! for anything else. Roll your dice from those and if there's
                                        an element in the scene that helps you, roll an additional die of that size. If it's
                                        super helpful, add another. If any other minion helps you, add one die of the next
                                        bigger size. If the villain helps you, add a d4. If Batman is present, also roll
                                        that black d12. ZOWIE! If any dice results match, you succeed! Tell how things went
                                        okay. (Generally, the higher the number on the match, the more awesome it is.) If
                                        no dice match, tell how things went bad. HOWEVER! If the d12 matches your match,

                                        Setup: Players start by each deciding on a trait to embody. Traits can range from D&D(Strength, Charisma) to outlandish(Deliciousness,
                                        Indignation). Each player rolls 4d6, removing the lowest die. These scores are assigned
                                        later. Each player has a d6 and 4 points. Points may be spent to increase die size(d6->d8->d10->d12->d20).
                                        For every point spent, write down a negative aspect(Clumsy, High-Cholesterol). Unspent
                                        points are used to re-roll. Creation: Decide on a player order, using die rolls to
                                        resolve disputes. Starting with the first player, choose an unassigned score. The
                                        active player and any players of their choosing roll a total, optionally re-rolling
                                        their own die once for each unspent point. If the total is under the score, subtract
                                        one from it, and next player becomes active. Otherwise, the active player's trait
                                        is assigned the score. The highest number rolled adds their negative aspects to the
                                        character. Players involved should narrate how their trait helped the active trait
                                        develop. Repeat until all scores are assigned. Play: Discuss this character. What
                                        story is this character in? How does each trait define them? What does each trait
                                        do on adventures? How does their story end?

                                        - DM announces difficulty - Player selected asks for help (But who can you trust?)
                                        - Player and helpers discard any number of cards (Jokers can't be discarded) - Add
                                        the value of all cards discarded vs difficulty (Face cards = 10) o Success: Player
                                        and Helpers draw a card o Failure: Discard cards from deck by amount of loss - Helpers
                                        exchange one random card with player (Corruption spreads) If the deck runs out, the
                                        clock strikes midnight and all players lose. Only non-corrupted players who escape
                                        win.

                                        Each player needs to prepare two songs and add them to a playlist online or even a physical mixtape! The goal of the game
                                        is to create a narrative that fits the music playing. To start the game you shuffle
                                        and play the music. If one of your songs is playing, you tell a story until either
                                        the song ends or you pass the story on to another player. If you pass the story before
                                        the song ends, hit skip track on your music player. When a players first song plays,
                                        they introduce a character that fits the music, including how he meets all other
                                        introduced characters so far. You then progress the story as you wish. When a players
                                        second song plays, they progress the story as usual, but they also have the option
                                        to retire their character in a fitting way. The game is over when the playlist finishes.
                                        All players then come up with an epilogue for the story.

                                        This game is a love letter to my years as a teenager. I have fond memories of staying up late with friends and lovers, sharing
                                        music whilst sat on the floor of dirty bedrooms. In these moments of intimacy, sometimes
                                        we talked about what memories or dreams the music conjured up for us. There are a
                                        lot of role-playing games that have a childish wonder, with dragons and swords and
                                        spaceships. There are also many games that have adult wonder, a chance to be a better
                                        person or conform to difficult ideals. This is my game about teenage wonder.

                                        You're Mooncalves. Mooncalves are ugly, mean, stupid creatures. You're stuck in a Minefield. When your Patience runs out,
                                        you'll blow up. Last one standing wins. Annoy everyone else, before they beat you
                                        to it! Fold an A4-sized paper down the middle. Write your Mooncalf's Name on one
                                        side, and three Deformities on the other. Put it down so your Name faces your way
                                        and your Deformities face the other Mooncalves. Hand every Mooncalf six six-sided
                                        dice, representing their Patience. The ugliest Mooncalf gets to take the first turn.
                                        On your turn, choose one: TAUNT MOONCALF: Insult the target Mooncalf by alluding
                                        to their Deformities. Roll their Patience. Steal any 6's rolled and add them to your
                                        own Patience. GET CENTERED: Tell the other Mooncalves what you do to calm yourself.
                                        Roll your Patience. For every 6 rolled, steal one Patience from a Mooncalf. Every
                                        1 rolled is removed from the game. HAIL MARY: (ONLY IF PATIENCE IS ONE DIE): Tell
                                        the others what dangerous gambit you make to endanger another Mooncalf. Roll your
                                        Patience. 1-2 : You blow up. 3-5 Steal two Patience from any Mooncalf. 6 Steal four
                                        Patience from any Mooncalf. Play continues counter-clockwise.

                                        ----------[ Background ]---------- Players are doctors. Each doctor has one nurse. Each game is one night on-call with 4
                                        patients (encounters) per doctor. ----------[ Setup ]---------- Each encounter, the
                                        Game-Master secretly determines the ailment for the patient: 1d4 "____________" 1

                                        Example: "infection of the respiratory system" ----------[ Rules ]---------- - Game-Master
                                        plays the role of the patient. - The doctor can ask 4 closed-ended questions to their
                                        patient, such as "where does it hurt?" or "what color is your stool?" - Once per
                                        game, the doctor can wake their nurse to take a history and ask 2 more questions.
                                        - At any time, the doctor can make a diagnosis. No other questions allowed after
                                        declaring a diagnosis. - A correct diagnosis yields 2 points in addition to points
                                        equal to the number of questions remaining. - Subtract 2 points for an incorrect
                                        diagnosis. ----------[ Winning ]---------- At the end of the game, each doctor totals
                                        all their points, receiving 2 extra points if they allowed their nurse to sleep all
                                        night. The doctor with the most points wins, which means they get tomorrow night
                                        off from work.

                                        Air. Any task which tests a diver's skills or endurance must be rolled for using
                                        two six-sided dice. This roll must meet or exceed the GM's difficulty number they've
                                        set for the task, 4 being easy, 8 moderate, and 12 difficult. Spending Air, minimum
                                        1, each adds +1 to the roll. A roll of 12 indicates a critical success, and the player
                                        succeeds with no air expended. Rolling a 2 automatically fails. Running out of air
                                        means certain death. Players take turns to act. For every round of turns, each player
                                        receives +2 air, with a maximum of 10. Danger lurks in the deep, be it other divers,
                                        underwater volcanoes, strong currents, or the dreaded Moray eel. Dangers damage players'
                                        air reserve as well as their supply. Attacks in Moray are simple checks against a
                                        target's difficulty, for players, 8. 3 successes versus an enemy yields victory.
                                        Treasure awaits. Care for a dive?

                                        The players are human Minds, computer-simulated by a starship travelling the galaxy. Upon reaching a system, the Minds are
                                        downloaded into "printed" Bodies for exploration. Mind: Choose 3 positive skills
                                        (totaling +7) & 3 negative skills (totaling -7). Body: Anything you can imagine (with
                                        GM approval). Gives +1 to two skills and -1 to one skill. Skills are limited to +/-5.
                                        Heart: +1 Heart point for each system entered. Dice are heartless: spending a Heart
                                        point allows re-rolling one action. The GM dreams up some "episodes" for systems.
                                        Example: "Ship sucked in by giant space amoeba, killable only with antimatter". The
                                        GM describes a system, and the Minds design Bodies in response. As the episode's
                                        plot unfolds, Minds decide what their Bodies do; the GM decides the difficulty of
                                        these actions and appropriate skills to use: The player rolls 3d6+skill & the GM
                                        rolls 3d6+difficulty. The GM describes success/failure proportional to how much over/under
                                        the roll is. A tie equals marginal success. Bad failures might kill a Body for this
                                        episode. The GM may reward good play with Heart points, pluses players can assign
                                        to skills, or items/Bodies that add to some skill.

                                        The Game Master has a lot of power to make this game fun. Every player except the Game Master plays for one head of a sizable
                                        monster - you can be a chimaera, a multi-headed dragon or something else. This brings
                                        three main conflicts - the obvious one with people not wanting you around, one of
                                        "How do I feed my huge body?" and the third of how your heads go along. It's better
                                        to cooperatively draw yourself first to get on the same page. If you're healthy and
                                        not starving, every head gets 3d6 for a scene, representing energy. Wounded heads
                                        get less (unconscious or dead zero) and while starving, every head gets less. You
                                        can use them to move your body around and actually do stuff, be it combat, searching
                                        for food or just trying to go somewhere. To do it, you roll any number of those dice.
                                        The Game Master sets target sum numbers for actual situations, giving bonuses freely
                                        for actions that make sense and directly subtracting rolls if multiple heads try
                                        to do a mutually incompatible actions. Keep in mind that heads might have different
                                        personalities. Try different settings (multi-core supercomputer?).

                                        a friend. Completing a day at work. Resolving a family argument. The scene ends ONLY
                                        when the task is complete. No matter the barriers, you MAY NOT give up. Failing is
                                        NOT an option: this task is ESSENTIAL to your day.

                                        Living somewhere with a language you don’t speak often involves jumping through linguistic hoops and internal translations
                                        to be able to understand and make yourself understood. Whether you’re a child learning
                                        the language in school forced to be translator to your parents, or if you’re working
                                        a job learning things you don’t know in your primary language but are expected to
                                        understand in a secondary one, or if you’re a translator forced to help mediate a
                                        family argument without getting involved, the struggle of working through multiple
                                        languages is one that many can relate to. My goal with this RPG was to replicate
                                        the back and forth of internal and external translation, the barriers and difficulties,
                                        the ease with which meaning can get lost, and the satisfaction when you finally break
                                        through. Thanks to Andy Berdan for helping me edit. Check out his amazing entry at

                                        A game for two players. One plays CAIN, the other ABEL. You're siblings, but your names, genders, and other details are open-ended.
                                        ABEL, describe your world. CAIN, this world is changing. How? ABEL has narrative
                                        authority over "the old." CAIN, over "the new." ABEL defines what is evil and reviles
                                        it. CAIN defines what is good but struggles to do it. You were taught these by THE
                                        FATHER, the giver of life. ABEL, who or what is THE FATHER? CAIN, why do you respect
                                        THE FATHER? Co-narrate and roleplay the following scenes. Interpret these prompts
                                        freely. Your areas of authority decide who plays NPCs, makes judgment calls, etc.
                                        I. ABEL's in trouble. CAIN helps. II. CAIN sins against THE FATHER. ABEL intercedes
                                        for CAIN. III. CAIN and ABEL each sacrifice for the sake of THE FATHER. IV. THE FATHER
                                        accepts ABEL's sacrifice but rejects CAIN's. V. CAIN becomes incensed with ABEL.
                                        ABEL only makes things worse. VI. CAIN murders ABEL. ABEL, your blood cries out.
                                        What does this mean? CAIN, how is your punishment greater than you can bear? ABEL,
                                        CAIN will live, for if CAIN is killed, they will be avenged sevenfold. What is CAIN's

                                        When I mentioned to my business partner Adam "Doc" Brackin that I was trying to decide what to do for this year's challenge,
                                        he "threw down a gauntlet." He wanted to see a game that somehow played with the
                                        idea of brotherhood. Later, when reviewing the contest guidelines, I started to brainstorm
                                        based on the idea of telling a familiar story from a different perspective. My mind
                                        turned immediately to mythology. I also knew I wanted to experiment with making a
                                        two-player game, and so the story of Cain and Abel came to mind. It's a morbid take
                                        on "brotherhood," admittedly, but I was intrigued by the idea of knowing what happens
                                        in the end and finding out through play how the characters could get there. The original
                                        myth is, after all, a bit vague and open to interpretation. Even in my research,
                                        I was surprised to find the version of the story I remembered included details that
                                        were actually based on one of the more common takes, not based strictly on the text
                                        itself. Incidentally, that research also turned me on to a theory that the story
                                        is part of a narrative recounting humanity's movement away from hunter-gatherer societies
                                        and toward agriculture, which is reflected in Abel's being a herdsman (the old) and
                                        Cain being a farmer (the new). I wanted to capture the idea that the world is changing
                                        in whatever backdrop the players might choose. I'd like to give a nod to Alex Roberts's
                                        Star Crossed, which informed a few of my approaches. For example, the roles of "lead"
                                        and "follow" inspired the roles of "Cain" and "Abel," and the way Star Crossed handles
                                        scenes led to the story beats I included in this game.

Shuffle the cards.  Deal them out, face up.  Run the program from top to bottom using these rules:

The oldest player points to the first card and reads it out loud, and performs its operation.  Working clockwise the next player points to the next card and performs its operation. If anyone makes a mistake, or the program doesn't make sense, everyone should yell "BUG" and then put their hand on their forehead.

                                            Nascence is a game about creation for 4-10,000 players. We are Powers, omnipotent creative forces with the ability to write
                                            the rules of reality. Initially, Powers are equally matched. None may triumph
                                            over another or enforce their will alone. Thus, there is one law: consensus.
                                            There must be a first decision. Whatever it is, it must be made collectively
                                            and with consent of all. Nothing exists - fictionally or within the rules of
                                            the game - that has not been created by Powers, either through consensus or whatever
                                            processes they put in place. Even the boundaries of the game, and the mechanisms
                                            that govern it, only exist as a product of the dialogue between Powers and the
                                            agreement to continue. The game begins properly once the first decision has been
                                            made, and ends at a point determined by the decisions and creations of the Powers.
                                            The Powers may need to address other questions: How do we interact with existence?
                                            How do we resolve conflicts? What do we seek? Do we have purpose? When does the

                                            lights out! It's up to the GM to decide what the detectives are facing; whether
                                            it be a billionaire hunting people for sport and their client is the next hunt,

                                            You must defeat your peers in a game of Dante's 'Inferno' style miniature golf.

                                            one of the other players. This process is repeated for all nine holes. The winner
                                            of each hole rolls a d6, while loser(s) roll a d4 (ties go to the winner of the
                                            previous hole.) The player with the lowest score at the end avoids damnation.

                                            chose a suit (diamond is money, clubs is violence, spades is stealth) and draw
                                            three cards each. The narrator shuffles the diamond, clubs and spades cards and
                                            uses them to define the difficulty of the challenges (number) and who must face
                                            them (suit). The woman can help by discarding a card and adding its number to
                                            her companion's card. In a tie, love wins. If the character wins the challenge
                                            they keep their card. If they lose, it's discarded after they enact the scene.
                                            A character dies when their cards end. If someone dies, the group instantly loses
                                            challenges of their suit and discard a card unless the woman decides to face
                                            it. After surviving ten challenges, the players use their remaining cards to
                                            describe the safe zone they've reached. The number and suit of the cards define
                                            the aspects they can describe.

                                            Agree on a game theme: "80's Soap Opera with horror elements", "a western game set in a dream world". Brainstorm until you
                                            have consensus on a theme. Players give their character traits: 3 positive, 2
                                            negative, 1 neutral. Meanwhile the GM Ruminates. As Play progresses the GM increases
                                            the number of dice ("Stakes") rolled representing escalating tension. Starting
                                            at 0 and ending at 6. Anything can have traits. A trait is simply something true.
                                            Traits applied to an action can come from anywhere. Resolution: To answer questions,
                                            ("do they see it?") simply compare applicable traits and infer the meaning. When
                                            a player declares an action: roll Fudge Dice equal to the Stakes, add to that
                                            the number of applicable positive traits, subtract negative traits. If positive
                                            you succeed, negative you fail, 0 -> describe how things escalated add one dice
                                            and roll again. Only the one acting rolls. Consequences: Actions can produce
                                            negative or positive traits applied to anything. Sequencing: When time needs
                                            control, players pass their turn to another player until every character has
                                            acted. Concession: A player or a GM can concede a scene at any time. A player
                                            must concede if they have accumulated 5 negative traits.

                                            There's several kind of kouhais. (See below). All of you are absolutely enthralled
                                            with Senpai. You want nothing more for him to recognize the unrequited love you
                                            send him and cheer him up when he's in despair. The Rules This is a love letter
                                            making game. Whoever last wrote a handwritten letter gets to be the Senpai first.
                                            The rest then pick a kouhai and write their love letter to Senpai. When all letters
                                            arrive, the previous Senpai chooses the next one. This can continue for as long
                                            as you like! There is no win scenario or anything like that. The only real rule
                                            is that all letters must be written in the style of the kouhai the player chose.

                                            and running also count as run. Remember that when it's your turn, you should
                                            be describing something over-the-top so saying "I run, run, run, run, run..."

                                            You are a team of co-workers. Decide together: - What is your workplace? - What big project is the boss breathing down your
                                            neck about? - How is your workplace catastrophically unsafe? Individually, name
                                            your character and decide: - What is my role on the team? (coordinator, expert,
                                            grunt, caretaker, gofer) - Why do I keep messing up? (lazy, greedy, incompetent,
                                            dishonest, arrogant) Take turns framing scenes starring your character. Everyone
                                            else plays their parts and NPCs, as needed. Each scene should lead to a point
                                            where one character (not necessarily yours) must risk their safety to move forward
                                            with the project. That character's player chooses: 1. Accept the injury. Don't
                                            tell the boss. 2. Report the unsafe condition. Tell the other players what new
                                            safety rule the boss has imposed. The other players decide how the workspace
                                            will be altered to comply with this rule, in a way that makes the workplace less
                                            safe and less efficient overall. The game ends when either: 1. The project is
                                            completed. The team is congratulated by the boss for a job well done, and for
                                            their good safety record. 2. One character accumulates three injuries. The team
                                            is reprimanded and the project is given to another team.

                                            someone who has last shown them fondness. Beasts may only slay someone who has

                                            Finally, we each roll 1d6 to alter our measure: 1&2. y=y-1 (min=0) 3. y=y 4&5.
                                            y=y+1 6. y=y+2 Crisis If we get the same goal, it's a crisis. We yell and say

                                            need a good plan and a character who Can. If only one of these, StoryLord can
                                            say "Roll High!" and player need to roll high to do thing. *** After one hour,
                                            adventurers burst into the room and kill all the orcs.

                                            played between the player and the GM. Difficulty is set by the GM as to how many

                                            must advance Clan Song to 6 then gain a final success to survive Globalization.
                                            If Clan Song drops below 1 the clan has been exterminated. Survival is meant
                                            to be difficult.

                                            Four players embody a growing civilization's Pantheon of Gods. Remove the aces from a deck of cards and distribute. Shuffle
                                            the deck, then make a 5x5 grid of cards. This represents the pantheon's domain.
                                            Each card is a region; you are worshipped in regions displaying your suit. Beginning
                                            with the Ace of Spades, each deity tells their story: their origins, icons, values,
                                            powers, champions, flaws. At any time you may snap your fingers, effecting the
                                            current story by changing a region. To destroy, roll 1d6 and add your number
                                            of regions; if this is above the region's value, flip it face-down. If the roll
                                            fails, you cannot interrupt the current tale again. To build, play the deck's
                                            top card onto any region. Afterwards, weave these changes into the current story.
                                            What occurred? Who is responsible? Presence is Power. Resolve divine conflicts
                                            by rolling 1d6, adding your number of controlled regions. Whenever a story concludes,
                                            add a card to the domain's edge. When the deck runs out, the pantheon crafts
                                            their civilization's collapse together. Flip one of your regions whenever you
                                            add to this tale. When you are out of face-up regions, tale ends; your deity
                                            is Forgotten.

                                            Players get one index card, and they have 5 minutes to draw their character on the card. The player is then given 5d10 to
                                            assign to features of their character with a maximum of 1d10. The player rolls
                                            each d10, assigning the result as HP to that feature. Before combat, the DM has
                                            30 seconds per player to draw out as many enemies as they can on post it notes,
                                            assigning 1d10 to each of the enemies they manage to create. Enemies must have
                                            at least 4 limbs, and one head. Combat is simple - the player targets an enemy
                                            / post-it with one of the features on their index card. The player then rolls
                                            their d10 for that feature against the enemy d10. If the player has the higher
                                            number, they destroy the post it. If the enemy wins, they do damage equal to
                                            their roll to that features HP. Features that drop to zero HP are erased. The
                                            player is considered "dead" if all their limbs assigned dice are all erased.
                                            Players may choose to heal by affixing the enemy limbs to their index card if
                                            they roll a 10 during combat.

                                            living in the real world. Required: One Chancellor and three to five Party Leaders.
                                            Leaders each create parties with three policies. Each Leader has a private world
                                            which they control and which can be anything they imagine. There is also a public

                                            futuristic but operate according to accepted laws of physics. Each session, the
                                            Chancellor describes a situation faced by the robot. Each Leader makes a speech

                                            private world. In turn, meet in another room. Describe what happens in your world.
                                            Invite the other Leader to make a deal to support your platform. Finally, one
                                            Leader proposes a resolution as to the action of the robot. Leaders will hold
                                            a vote on each proposal. If one passes, that is what the robot does. If it fails,
                                            another Leader proposes another resolution. If all resolutions fail, the Chancellor
                                            decides the consequences of inaction.

                                            of "Confetti" (multiple colors of six-sided dice,) and a large "Confetti Bowl."

                                            "weak stomach," and "bad with budgets." Then pick one skill. Such as "eye for
                                            detail," "eclectic taste," and "crafty." Plan your party. As a group, discuss
                                            and decide on food and drink, decor, music, etc. When a decision is made, put
                                            a piece of Confetti into the Confetti Bowl for each player. Subtract one piece
                                            for each hinderance applicable to the decision, add an extra piece for each skill
                                            relevant to the decision. Roll the Confetti! The total is your group's score.

                                            But what if you could do both? The person with the shortest pinky starts the

                                            the player to your right is your enemy. On a turn, the player proposes a utilitarian
                                            solution (best for the most people) to the peril relevant to their force, to
                                            which each other player must ask one question that must be resolved. Once each
                                            player has proposed their solution, vote. Heads = yes, tails = no. Place one
                                            of your coins in front of each player, conceal your votes somehow, then reveal
                                            all votes simultaneously. The solution with most Heads votes wins. If any solutions
                                            are tied for most, a consensus cannot be reached and no solution is chosen. The
                                            players lose and Peril wins.

                                            Eighteen years into the voyage to Perseus V and something has gone terribly wrong. One player is the ship's AI core, potentially
                                            damaged and unstable after long years in space. Announce your name and mission.
                                            The other players are crew members, woken from cryosleep. Announce your name,
                                            special skill, and what you left behind on Earth. From a standard deck, the AI
                                            draws cards equal to twice the number of crew, plus one. More black cards means
                                            you are BENIGN; more red means you are HOSTILE. Shuffle and stack them in secret.
                                            The AI provides someone a PERILOUS SCENARIO and DUBIOUS REQUEST. E.g. "The cargo
                                            bay is burning. Override the airlocks to vent our air reserves." They take a
                                            card and narrate what happens. Red means some harm befalls the mission. Black
                                            is a beneficial result. Repeat this step. Once everyone has acted, one crew can
                                            narrate a PERSONAL SACRIFICE to reveal an extra card. The crew must now decide
                                            whether to DEACTIVATE the AI or TRUST it to guide them onwards. If the AI is
                                            deactivated it loses; otherwise it wins. If the crew trust a benign AI or deactivate
                                            a hostile AI, they win; otherwise they lose.

                                            Use a deck of 52 poker cards. The guide setup a location where strange phenomena occur. The players say who they are and
                                            describe something strange they have witnessed. When the guide describes something
                                            strange, if the players interact with the phenomenon they turns over a card.
                                            If the card is black the guide narrates something horrific, if the card is red
                                            something wondrous. The players can continue to turn cards to interact with the
                                            phenomenon. If they score 21 they make a discovery and the scene concludes positively
                                            for them. If they bust over 21 someone is hurt and the scene concludes negatively.
                                            If they fight or flight they keep their hand and the guide draws cards against
                                            them. If the guide beats their hand without busting 21 someone is killed, otherwise
                                            the players narrate the outcome. When the players score 21, they put a card aside
                                            for the final scene, when they bust the guide chooses the card. The game ends
                                            when the final hand scores or exceeds 21. The color that appears the most determines
                                            the nature of the final scene (horrific or wondrous). The players survive if
                                            they score 21 and die if they bust.

                                            adventure generation will be interactive. Each player will use an adjective or
                                            noun to describe: - Tone of adventure - Main villain - A challenge they want
                                            to face - Etc. The Referee will then combine these words to produce something
                                            coherent. Random details are similarly crowdsourced (e.g. "The Innkeeper is..."
                                            "Tall!" "Rude!" "A monkey!"), but the Referee has the final word on what's admissible.
                                            Ideally the game is played as a one-shot or short campaign, with each character
                                            being able to face their sin and get close or reach their goal. As in any good
                                            RPG the goal is to have fun telling a story together. Uncertain actions are decided
                                            by the Referee based on the situation. If dice have to be used it will be by
                                            comparing results. Being good at something allows to throw two and choose one.
                                            Being great allows to roll three.

                                            fold the pieces of paper and mix them up by category, then each player picks
                                            1 or 2 depending on the category (1 location, 2 quotes, etc.). The players follow
                                            the alphabetical order and play as the main character they had picked. The first
                                            one starts telling their story using all the picked features and adding everything
                                            they wish. The more detailed the better. If the one who's telling the story names
                                            any word of those held by any of the other players, they can interrupt the story
                                            and start telling their own, taking into account everything that had already
                                            been said as facts. The whole story has to make...some sense! The player who
                                            end up telling their whole story wins!

                                            it to a fantasy setting and got it down to 200 words! We've played and showed
                                            the original PTF to at least 50 people and generally got great response, and
                                            I think PTFFM transfers the most important parts and should work quite well.
                                            :) I had a lot of fun doing this - writing and editing down to 200 words is a
                                            lot like optimizing code, change two words here to one word - same meaning but
                                            less words! Thanks goes out to the people who gave feedback! Ola, Victor, Alex,

                                            This RPG was partially born out of the idea of having politics as the main genre. With the recent (past few months) mass

                                            Sit down with a friend - across a table from each other. You need ten counters and a d10. The two of you are in a relationship.
                                            Roll a d10 each. Whoever has the higher number has the power in the relationship.
                                            That person alone decides the nature of the relationship, and why they have the
                                            power. If you rolled the lower number, you cannot engage here. The person with
                                            power begins with six counters, the person without begins with four. The person
                                            without power describes a grievance. "You stay out too late," "you don't do the
                                            washing up," "your drinking is a problem." Roll a d10 between you. If it is lower
                                            than the number of counters that the person in power has, they physically take
                                            a counter from the person without power. If it is higher, the person without
                                            power sets one of their tokens aside. If you wish, you may role-play the argument,
                                            with the 'winner' of the argument being the one who moved the token. When the
                                            person without power has no more tokens, roll a final time. If it is higher,
                                            they can narrate leaving, as dramatically and cathartically as they want; otherwise,

                                            Each player gets a card and a pawn. From high downwards, say your name, field,
                                            and quirk. Lowest card? You're sick. Build the Disease Track: 5 facedown cards.
                                            ALWAYS: When sick: Put your pawn on first track card. When on a facedown card:
                                            Flip it and describe that step's symptoms. EACH DAY: Sick pawns advance a card.
                                            Those already at the end die. Everyone picks one: - RESEARCH: Draw a card. Describe
                                            your findings. - TREAT: Discard a card whose suit matches the track. Move someone's
                                            pawn back a step, say how you help. If the card's 7+, you're sick. - COLLABORATE:
                                            Swap hands with someone. Keep a card and swap back. If one was sick, both are
                                            now. - PUBLISH: Play a card faceup and gain 1 prestige. If its suit matches the
                                            track, you're sick. - CURE: Secretly look at the entire track. If your hand plus
                                            PUBLISHED cards forms a poker hand better than the track's, you find a cure;
                                            gain 5 prestige and everybody can TREAT without discarding. If not, discard your
                                            hand. AFTER 7 DAYS, most prestige is celebrated; dead are mourned.

                                            and drop the highest two. 1-6 They don't trust the Stranger. 7-9 They're uncertain,
                                            but buying. 10+ The Stranger wins them over. Turn 7: An Authority figure arrives.
                                            There is a final judgement. Play to climax, then roll three dice. If the townsfolk
                                            are... ...Suspicious, drop highest. ...Supportive, drop lowest. ...Uncertain
                                            or Tied, drop median. 1-6 The Stranger flees town. 7-9 The Stranger's plan succeeds.
                                            10+ The Stranger feels sentimental, and settles down among friends.

                                            Extract from a deck of cards a stack of Aces(1), Twos, Threes, and two Fives.
                                            Shuffle this stack together. Deal five cards from this stack to each player;

                                            - Communicate. Or don't. Continue until at least one player empties his/her hand.
                                            If PCs do not meet, resolve the story. If PCs meet, reveal PCs and resolve the

                                            Together, find answers at the mountainside. Describe why you choose to investigate.
                                            In secret, choose a friend you want to PROTECT. You find an opening. As you descend,

                                            If you roll two or more 1's, the Red Lady crawls from beyond, her jaw twitching
                                            sporadically. Either You are TAKEN by her. Or If a friend succeeds on a roll
                                            to throw another friend towards her, they are TAKEN in your place. Those TAKEN

                                            players betray each other. If two remain, and one PROTECTs the other, they escape

                                            To play this the GM will probably have to prepare some content for the players to explore. Don't expect betrayals to come
                                            immediately, they are the payoff after building up in tension over the course
                                            of the session as players discover their characters. This game requires good
                                            players and a good Gm. For the lazy GM, you can just Frankenstein together dungeons
                                            from Dungeons and Dragons modules to create the underground city quickly. Be

                                            establishes key moments in their lives by reminiscing over their incarnation,

                                            to comment on those of their fellows. Departure: Each incarnation leaves, starting
                                            from the first incarnation and moving forward. When departing they share what

                                            and tails sides are needed. This is a cooperative storytelling game. One player
                                            is the DIRECTOR who creates the plot and stage for the story. Other players assume
                                            the roles of characters in an 8-bit video game world and take turns acting out
                                            their part. The KISMET mechanic decides the outcome of story-altering decisions
                                            made by characters. The player shakes all three coins in their cupped hands then
                                            tosses them to the tabletop. A player can make one KISMET toss each turn. * 1
                                            head = failure without consequence. * 2 heads = success. * 3 heads = heroic success.
                                            * 3 tails = utter failure with consequence. Stories are set into stages of about
                                            10 actions per player. At the end of each stage players draw one card and add
                                            that number to their SCORE. Face cards count as 10, Jokers count as 20. For each
                                            20 points added to total score, players get one REPLAY that can be spent to redo
                                            any KISMET toss. At the end of the story, any remaining REPLAYS can be saved
                                            for the next story.

                                            accident, murder, suicide, life sentence, vanished, etc. 4) Each Anchor in turn
                                            frames a scene WITHOUT you, answering: "Who is the Other that satisfies this
                                            Anchor's Need while the Revenant is gone?". 5) Describe when and how you come
                                            back from the dead: zombie, ghost, presumed dead, Ulysses, etc. 6) Each Anchor
                                            in turn frames a scene with BOTH you and the Other, answering: "Can the Revenant
                                            come back into this Anchor's life?" 7) Answer: "Can I still have my old life
                                            back? If not, what do I do?", then narrate an epilogue.

                                            This is my first "200 Word RPG Challenge". I tried to be as clear and direct as possible, trusting the mechanics (as simple

                                            Humans process experiences in dreams. REVERISTS instead exude them as a thick syrup. Using these they concoct REVERIES: authored
                                            dreams. Your workshop is a cottage on Rivulet Way, in the City Adherent. After
                                            the Amaranthine revolution, the City is changing. Its people crave dreams. And
                                            you're selling. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                            Reverist draws three cards. These are EXPERIENCES. HEARTS: positivity, melancholy.
                                            CLUBS: echoes of revolution. DIAMONDS: hardship, drudgery. SPADES: hopelessness.

                                            Each Reverist commits one EXPERIENCE to the REVERIE. Place face-down, reveal
                                            simultaneously. Describe your EXPERIENCE. The highest numbered suit, added up,

                                            gain 1 COIN, draw DIAMOND. Then MAKE ENDS MEET: Each spends D6, halved, in COIN.

                                            Create a dystopia that your characters currently live in and a utopia your characters wish to replace it with. Take a d20
                                            representing the Revolution Level and set it's value to 1. Each player should
                                            have a character with a name, ambition and principle. The game is played for
                                            a fixed amount of time. If the time expires before the Revolution Level hits
                                            20 then the revolution is crushed and the characters executed, exiled or ostracised.
                                            Players now take turns to frame scenes starting with the player who has most
                                            recently been in trouble for political or social activism and proceeding anti-clockwise.
                                            During a scene the revolutionary must propose a course of action that will advance
                                            the cause. If they wish other character's help they include those characters
                                            in the scene and try to persuade them in-character. They then roll a d20 trying
                                            to beat the current Revolution Level. If they succeed the Revolution Level increases
                                            one, otherwise it decreases one and all characters involved in the scene must
                                            skip their next scene framing as they escape the persecution and consequences
                                            of their failure. Characters may cross out their ambition or principle to turn
                                            a failure into success. Viva!

                                            This game was inspired by the centenary of Russian Revolution and the Black Hack's collapsing die. It's meant to be played
                                            with about 4-6 players so if playing with fewer you might want to swap the d20
                                            with a d12. I am hoping to playtest and release an expanded version of the game
                                            with a few more gameplay options than you can get in 200 words.

                                            Article I: Principles 1. The players are the rightful voices of the people. They have no game master; it is their duty alone
                                            to rise up against the weak king and his corrupt ministers. 2. United, the players
                                            will decide on the list of ideals they will fight for. 3. Every player has an
                                            absolute right to choose two of those ideals for their character to advocate
                                            for, and one they will oppose. 4. The characters are each the leader or paragon
                                            of a faction or class in the realm. 5. That faction will be played by the player
                                            sitting across from them. Article II: Administration 1. Each player in turn will
                                            narrate their character's revolutionary struggle. All other characters and factions
                                            may participate as needed. 2. The player controlling the current character's
                                            faction has special duty to speak for the faction's interests; to take to the
                                            streets to support their leader - or to stop their betrayal. 3. When conflict
                                            arises between characters or factions, the matter will be resolved with a majority
                                            vote among the players. Article III: State of Emergency 1. A player may overrule
                                            a vote. 2. Doing so requires sacrificing one of their ideals forever.

                                            World powers vie for supremacy at a chess tournament. Setup A chess set (32 pieces) is placed into a bag. 4-6 players take
                                            turns drawing pieces from the bag until all pieces are taken. If a player already
                                            has a King, they re-draw. Play alternates between turns of Diplomacy and Match
                                            Phases. Diplomacy Players holding a King are Superpowers. Superpowers seek an
                                            Ally from the other players to commit their pieces during the Match using Diplomacy.
                                            Players that are neither Superpowers nor Allies are Hosts. Match Superpowers
                                            face each other and commit up to four of their pieces including their King. Allies
                                            decide to commit and add any of their pieces to either side. Kings and Pawns
                                            have no value. Queens are worth two. All other pieces are worth one. The side
                                            with the higher value wins. The losing Superpower surrenders a random piece to
                                            the winner. On a Draw the Hosts win and they draw from either side until each
                                            host has a piece. Victory is declared when one player has both Kings or after
                                            ten turns. After ten turns, Kings and Pawns are counted as 1 point each. The
                                            highest total wins, or the status quo preserved.

                                            52-card deck: * Cronus' hand: Three cards per child. * Children's hand: Starts

                                            Children draw once from their personal decks to hand. * Attention. Rhea examines
                                            one non-devoured child's hand. * Roleplay. Scheme, plead, love. Children play
                                            children's games, hint at jokers, plan when to discard. Rhea coordinates. Cronus
                                            overhears, making threats aloud and plans in secret. * Devouring. Cronus may

                                            or are devoured. * Retaliation. Clockwise from Cronus, choose: discard a joker
                                            or pass. *** Red Joker: Mother's Revenge. Devoured children are freed. *** Black
                                            Joker: Titanomachy. Each non-devoured child discards a black card; total them.
                                            Cronus discards all his black cards. Face cards are 11. Highest total wins. Devoured
                                            children cannot roleplay or discard black cards. After Titanomachy/four turns...
                                            * Cronus wins Titanomachy/child with Black Joker devoured: Cronus passes judgement.
                                            * Cronus loses Titanomachy: survivors pass judgement. * Another result: negotiate
                                            settlement.

                                            CHECK IN: This is a game about spending the night in a spa. Each player introduces their character by NAMING them, EXPLAINING
                                            why they're at the spa, and SETTING a goal for the night. Explanations include,
                                            but are not limited to, loneliness, boredom, shelter, and lust. SPA RULES: The
                                            game lasts five rounds, each round representing two hours at the spa, starting
                                            at 8 p.m. Each round, each player will select a location to visit. Each player
                                            rolls 1d6. Players pick locations based on the die roll, going lowest to highest.
                                            If multiple players pick the same location, they share a scene. If a player is
                                            alone at a location, they share something they see, something they do, or something
                                            they dream. At the end of round, each player rolls 1d6. On a 1, something special
                                            happened. On a 6, something weird happened. Player describes what happened. LOCATIONS:

                                            they meet their goal? Do they have any regrets?

                                            success. Rolls using an artifact get +1. Extremely difficult tasks get -1 or
                                            -2. Players get 3 wound slots and 1 mortal wound. If all slots are filled they
                                            go into a coma and (depending on the damage type) pass out or bleed out. One

                                            The following game is based on true events. Play it at your own risk. Setting: You, and your friends, are part of a team
                                            whose goal is to create a brand of Role Playing games and spread it around the
                                            world against all odds. The road to success is paved with adversities, from lack
                                            of interest from the masses to financial difficulties in starting up your project.
                                            Mechanics: Before starting the game, roll 3d6. This will represent your mental
                                            fortitude. Every time you come across an adversity, roll a d6. 1-3 result in
                                            failure and 4-6 result in success. On a failure, roll another d6, add the new
                                            value to the failed roll and reduce it from your mental fortitude. In this hard
                                            times, the only people you can rely on are your teammates. If their mental fortitude
                                            is equal or higher than yours, they can attempt to rise your spirits. In this
                                            situation, they roll a d6 and the outcome takes over your mental fortitude test,
                                            if it succeeds or fails. If your mental fortitude reaches 0, you realize that
                                            it was all for nothing, the world doesn't deserve it, and you take your own life.

                                            I was interested in the difficulty of clarity when you condense an RPG down to 200 words. Even in regular RPG's, there is
                                            a lot of dispute around how rules should be interpreted. I tried to gamify that

                                            and how they are interpreted, hence the theme.

                                            Prep: Each player comes up with a character. You (the GM) complete/modify their stats in the appropriate/requested system
                                            until they are balanced. Break these down into a few basic attributes, each with
                                            a tier, 0 to 3. Write down only those attributes for the players, but say verbally
                                            what they represent. Play: Players take turns acting, and you adjudicate with
                                            the appropriate rulebooks. If you get sick of that, instead you and each player
                                            notes the relevant attribute and rolls a die. On a maximum roll, increase tier
                                            by 1 and roll again, on a 1, subtract and roll again. Highest tier, or highest
                                            roll with equal tier, wins. Tier/Point Cost (Optional): 0/0 1/1 2/3 3/6 EXAMPLE:

                                            Players have ten coins hidden behind a sheet. At sight they write their life-ponts, five for the number of players. Three
                                            secrets are written hidden. Draw a frog on another sheet and divide it into many
                                            numbered boxes as many players plus one. Night: all close their eyes. In turn
                                            players place one coin on one box. If they decide CROSS they are stabbing the
                                            frog, if they decide HEAD they are cancelling a CROSS. It's possible put no coin.
                                            Whoever has no more can turn the face of another coin. Day: CROSSES counts. If
                                            they are equal or exceed the value of the box ALL players lose as many life-points.
                                            Players must place HEADS until crosses return below the number, but players can
                                            place just 1 coin each. Those who do not want to, they can offer a secret instead:they
                                            lose 2 life-point, but can remove a CROSS from a box. You can accuse others of
                                            being "Scorpions". Accused ones must show their coins: those who have none are
                                            eliminated. Non-scorpions can claim compensation: you must choose whether to
                                            reveal a secret or give two coins to each. Repeat Night/Day until one player

                                            You'll need some paper, pens/pencils, and d6s. If you play as a group, come to
                                            consensus on the selection. You have a starting BUDGET of 12. You have to spend
                                            this budget to select 6 shows for the year. Each type of show has a COST, a PRESTIGE,

                                            skills on missions to save the world. Record your codename and three skills numbered
                                            3-5. Each Agent is issued 3d6. THE ACTION The Mission begins with one Agent the
                                            Nemesis who confronts each Agent with a Challenge in turn. When you face a Challenge,
                                            roll your dice; each 6 and each result matching one of your skills is a success,
                                            and you must honestly describe how you achieved success without fully divulging
                                            the nature of the skills used to succeed. Each 2 is given to the Nemesis. Each
                                            1 is lost. Matching skill successes let you take a die from the Nemesis, describe
                                            how that skill defeated the Nemesis, and become the new Nemesis. THE DEBRIEFING
                                            If only the Nemesis has dice, you fail the mission. Defeating the Nemesis three
                                            times completes the mission. Write your assessment of other Agents' skills, then
                                            reveal your own. For each secret skill you successfully determine, you earn one
                                            point. For each skill an Agent keeps secret, they earn three points. The Agent
                                            with the most points plus dice wins.

                                            DOMINIONS, 3 words max each. Mix up each group in a cup, blindly take one of
                                            each except Dominion. This is your character, a SOUL. The 5 of you are chained
                                            together, and one is to be sacrificed to the Deities in 15 minutes. You have
                                            that long to decide which one of you it should be. You may be honest or lie.
                                            Your character wants to survive, but also wants a worthy sacrifice. Keep your
                                            decision secret. After 15 minutes write down your choice and put it in a cup.
                                            Each player now takes a Dominion. You're now the Deity of that. Congratulations.
                                            The 5 Deities must now decide which of the 5 souls they want. You want someone
                                            sacrificed who is suitable, someone who has lived like how you'd want souls to
                                            live. All information is revealed. Once there is a majority agreement, tally
                                            up the votes of the souls. If the Souls chose your selection, Deities are pleased,
                                            all win. If they didn't, world ends, sorry. A tied vote reboots the universe.

                                            received by the elected plan and add +1 for each applicable player skill. - If

                                            of your fellow players rolls 2 6-sided dice, picks one of the values and says
                                            how: His/her family oppose to the marriage! Another suitor asks for your hand!
                                            You are sent at war! You spend time with him/her in secret! Your father arranges
                                            another marriage for you! An innocent dies to help you! Afterwards, you have
                                            thirty seconds to tell how you solve or enjoy the situation; otherwise, your
                                            beloved one will be taken away from you forever! In case of a tie or if one or
                                            both dice show the same results of the previous roll, re-roll. Don't pick the
                                            same value twice. At each turn, sum the value used with all the previous ones.
                                            If you reach 13, your lover dies! When you go past 21, you can enjoy the marriage!
                                            If you can't marry or manage to marry your lover, another player takes up the
                                            role of the Princess.

                                            This player is now the Prime Minister. Other players join by declaring their
                                            loyalty to SIDEWALKIA. The PM declares each new player a role in the government.
                                            Each player describes an aspect of SIDEWALKIA's landscape, using real-world landmarks
                                            nearby as inspiration. Each player describes an unusual, outlandish historical

                                            someone walks through your square, SIDEWALKIA suffers a natural disaster. Describe
                                            it, mourn, and rebuild. If someone pauses, they vacationed in SIDEWALKIA. Describe

                                            index card: Prosperity-Good present, good future Repentance-Bad present, good

                                            choose three, placing them face down in the center of the table. Gameplay: The
                                            game is played over three rounds. At the start of each round, one image is revealed
                                            which portrays part of the vision. The prophets take turns expounding upon the
                                            meaning of this portion of the vision from their unique perspectives. After the
                                            first prophet speaks, each subsequent prophet will agree with a portion of the
                                            former interpretation, while adding a unique perspective in an "I agree that...but
                                            you missed..." style. Rearrange player order each round. At the end of a round,
                                            randomly select one player's index card as the 'correct' interpretation. At the
                                            end of subsequent rounds, players work together to form correct interpretations
                                            into a cohesive whole.

                                            a religious context. Because religion can be a touchy subject, care should be
                                            taken not to make anyone uncomfortable when a religious context is chosen for
                                            the game. With that being said, the closer the chosen religious context is to
                                            that of the players, the more depth the players will bring to their interpretations.

                                            The Four Abilities When you create a character, you have 7 points to divide among
                                            these four Abilities. Physical: strength and health. Mental: intelligence and

                                            Every character may take one Action on their turn. To resolve an Action: - Select
                                            an applicable Ability - Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the Ability

                                            === INTRODUCTION === It's farming season and Simple Farmer Geoff (SFG) has the best seeds. You need them to survive. ===
                                            PREPARATION === Set timer for desired round duration. One player is SFG while
                                            the rest choose monikers as desired. Prepare numbered tokens (non-duplicated).
                                            SFG privately chooses one token to be the Rare Seed. Players put tokens in a
                                            container. Each player draws one random token. SFG receives the rest in-container.
                                            === PLAY === SFG draws one token from container. Next clockwise player (P1) asks
                                            SFG "What is that seed worth?" or similar variant. SFG responds according to
                                            seed value. The closer its value to the Rare Seed, the more preposterous. P1
                                            may take SFG's seed, trade their seed for SFG's, or pass. If passed, SFG keeps
                                            that seed for themselves and draws another. P2 questions P1 or SFG for an indicated
                                            seed. Players answer based on implied seed value via SFG's first claim. Continue
                                            clockwise. Play continues until timer ends the "season." Rare Seed revealed.
                                            Players add seeds. Values less than Rare Seed's added to player's count. Values
                                            greater than Rare Seed's subtract 5 points from player's count. Highest total
                                            value wins. === STRATEGY === Bluffing. Multi-seed claims. Consecutive seasons,
                                            new Rare Seeds. Rotating SFGs.

                                            You are self-aware characters who desperately want to last through the season by living entertaining and hilarious episodes.
                                            Choose a location for the sitcom (for example College, Cape Town or Undersea
                                            Laboratory). Each player creates a character with: - An advantageous trait (such
                                            as smart, rich, magician) - A debilitating trait (unlucky, distracted, haunted)
                                            - A gimmick (catchphrase, move, song) Each trait is assigned two six-sided dice,
                                            the location three dice and each gimmick gets three tokens. To create an episode,
                                            come up with a plot summary, using character traits, gimmicks and location effects
                                            (a guest character, event or natural disaster). Roll a die for each trait/location
                                            effect referenced and add +1 for each gimmick token used to get the episode rating.
                                            More dice and tokens can be added after each roll. Each episode needs a rating
                                            of 6 or higher, otherwise it's too boring and the sitcom is cancelled. After
                                            each episode, choose a character that was exceptionally funny and renew one of
                                            their dice or tokens. The season lasts until all dice and tokens have been used
                                            up. After the season has ended, you can become everlasting reruns or move on
                                            to the next season with renewed dice and tokens.

                                            This game is meant to capture a particular part of the LGBTQ experience. It's about hiding parts of yourself, and not being
                                            able to reveal them until you find someone who you can relate with. I tried to
                                            be careful with the wording and the tone that it set. You are not revealing another
                                            player's trait - instead you are allowing another player to reveal their own
                                            traits. There is also the option to gain a fourth trait, because it gives more
                                            common ground to connect and become comfortable with another person. The win
                                            condition is tricky: I wanted an incentive to reveal your own traits, but I also
                                            wanted an incentive to reveal traits quickly, so that players would rely on each
                                            other when they had the chance, and not just wait for a good NPC to come up.

                                            You discover a discarded nickname on the side of the road. It sounds something like "bucko." It's well-loved, but no longer
                                            fits its person. You try it on: strange, but comfortable. You feel like someone
                                            else. Each player writes three nicknames on papers; shuffle them in a large mug.
                                            One player says, "I found a nickname on the way here." They draw a nickname,
                                            say the first feelings they think of, and wear it--not just the name, but the
                                            love and hate within it. They don't know who it belonged to, just its feelings
                                            and memories. They tell the rest of story of arriving here, wearing these new
                                            experiences. Another player asks to try it on. They describe new feeling and
                                            memories from the nickname. Players, in turn, try on the name and share its history.
                                            Players invent these experiences, but must relate them back to the name. Only
                                            refer to the nicknamed player by the nickname. Consider the feeling of being
                                            called something you didn't ask for, compared to your name and things you've
                                            been called, with their own feelings and memories. Players exchange playing the
                                            role of this name and, maybe by the end, someone keeps it.

                                            against the wall. When you throw a piece of spaghetti, yell out a product pitch
                                            for your startup. - If the spaghetti sticks: congratulations, you have product
                                            / market fit! - If it temporarily sticks but then falls off: you're getting close
                                            to something good - If it falls off immediately: no luck, describe why this product
                                            didn't work Go around until everyone has thrown four pieces of spaghetti. Once
                                            you have one successful idea, new pitches can be adjacent products or new markets.
                                            When you're done, count up the number of successes to determine your startup's
                                            outcome: 1-2: Aqui-hired 3-4: Major Acquisition 5-6: IPO 7+: The Next Facebook!

                                            in a packet or the last drams of a fancy drink. The Sorcerer who contributes

                                            taboos. Sorcerers gather at a table or circle, and begin by uttering a Spell,
                                            (after writing it down and hiding it from themselves) which becomes their Magic

                                            an invalid Spell, someone may accuse them of committing magic taboo. After up

                                            Being the president is hard. Being their press secretary might be harder. Everyone writes two headlines (scandals,accomplishments,
                                            etc.) and throws them into a hat. One player in this game starts as the press
                                            secretary for the most controversial and polarizing president ever. Everyone
                                            else acts as reporters for opposing media. The press secretary draws a headline
                                            from the hat, reads it aloud, and has to make a statement defending the president's
                                            role in the headline. After the statement each reporter may ask up to three questions.
                                            The secretary must address them all. A reporter may add a detail to the headline's
                                            story instead of asking a question. Reporters should record the secretary's answers.
                                            If a reporter catches an inconsistency, they get an extra question/detail.The
                                            secretary pulls one more headline and the process is repeated. The press secretary
                                            gets fired and replaced by the next player. Reporters may ask about or add to
                                            previous headlines, but players only get three of these until a new headline
                                            is read or they catch inconsistencies. Repeat this until everyone has been secretary.
                                            You can decide on a winner, but no one gets to keep their job.

                                            shuts down permanently. Return half its Energy to the center. Robots may choose
                                            to shut down even if energy remains. The game ends when all Robots have shut
                                            down and silence returns to the Earth.

                                            and Supplies(SC) SC show three things: -Yarn type (acrylic, wool, cotton, cashmere)

                                            1 action then play a SC. Actions: - Take and replace one face up SC - Draw two

                                            It just means pulling apart something you are working on in whole or part to
                                            either get back to a mistake you made and fix it or to start all over or salvage

                                            a mistake." "I wasn't going to finish it so I frogged the whole thing." "I feel
                                            like I've been frogging all day" The reason it is called this is because to frog

                                            everything from you except your soul. Now you're onboard a dingy boat with no
                                            elbow room, headed for someplace better-or so you hope. Then the food runs out.
                                            You'd heard stories of refugees playing dangerous games on other boats, with
                                            unlucky fools becoming sustenance for those left behind. You would not call them

                                            of any community. Your homeland as you knew it might be changed forever, but
                                            like the name Saigon, it will never be truly gone so long as you remember it.
                                            Tales are told in rounds. After everyone has taken a turn, the worst storyteller
                                            is killed to feed the others. Roll a six-sided dice at the end of every round.
                                            Remember the result, as you remember home. Once you have rolled six thrice, you
                                            will arrive at the mainland with whoever is left. They "win", surviving with
                                            new stories to tell. So tell your story, sailor of dreams. Sing of our homeland.

                                            An old and heirless monarch sits the throne. The time has come to choose a successor. A proclamation is made. There shall
                                            be a test. Any may enter. One will be chosen to rule. The rest will be banished
                                            forever. One player is the monarch. In a few words, they describe their reign,
                                            their kingdom, their character. Then, going clockwise from the monarch, each
                                            player presents their character. There are three rounds. Each round, the monarch
                                            issues a challenge. This could be a question (which is the most important virtue
                                            of a monarch?), or a task (bring me the tooth of a mountain lion). The players
                                            have two minutes to prepare their responses. Each player rolls a D6. The highest
                                            goes first, and then clockwise from them. On their turn, each player gives their
                                            character's answer, or describes how their character accomplishes the task. At
                                            the end of the third round, the monarch pronounces the heir to the kingdom and
                                            explains why they were chosen. The heir then becomes the monarch and the next
                                            game begins. The new monarch may keep their character, or create a new monarch
                                            with a new kingdom.

                                            You are enthusiastic children with wild imaginations in a world of your own making, where bullies are ogres, parents are
                                            androids, juiceboxes are healing potions, and THE FLOOR IS LAVA!!! Start with
                                            1d6+3 ENTHUSIASM and 1d4 IMAGINATION, 1 special power per IMAGINATION point,
                                            and 1 HEALTHY SNACK or 1 SUGARY SNACK. Find more snacks during adventurers!!!
                                            Whoever has the most IMAGINATION is GM. This can change throughout the session.
                                            The GM introduces PROBLEMS that must be overcome. Non-GMs can add extra PROBLEMS,
                                            too, and gain 1 IMAGINATION each time they do. When you try something risky,
                                            roll a number of d6s equal to your IMAGINATION. Each 6 is a success, and earns
                                            everyone 1 ENTHUSIASM. If you fail, the GM tells you how things get worse, and
                                            you lose ENTHUSIASM equal to your IMAGINATION. If you ever roll two or more 1s,
                                            your imagination RUNS WILD. You create 1d4 PROBLEMS and everyone loses 1d4 ENTHUSIASM.
                                            WHOA! If your ENTHUSIASM reaches 0, you fall asleep. If it goes above 10, you
                                            run off, create 1d4 PROBLEMS, lose all ENTHUSIASM and fall asleep. HEALTHY SNACKS
                                            give 1d6 ENTHUSIASM. SUGARY SNACKS give 2d6 ENTHUSIASM.

                                            Grant Howitt's elegant winning entry last year made me really inspired me to make little games that do 1d3 interesting things.
                                            In this game, I wanted the role of GM to be shared, passed back and forth, taking
                                            advantage of the idea that this world is created by the characters (sugared up
                                            children playing make believe). I also am fascinated by press-your-luck mechanics,
                                            and tried to put in a few ways for that to happen (managing your enthusiasm,
                                            electing for more imagination power at a cost, etc.) The game usually ends in
                                            a self-imposed TPK, with exhausted children littering the yard, but how long
                                            that takes is up to your play-style. Have fun! Sugar-Rush Make-Believe was based

                                            throwing papers and late assignments to the wind. You, Chip, Jamie, and Slim

                                            you see Mathis with his gang, the Sluggers, messing with kids who want to enter.

                                            Chip with his baseball bat, and you with your tennis racket and some tennis balls.

                                            Super Clash Mini is a superhero RPG. Each session plays out one issue of a superhero story. Character Creation: Assign 6
                                            points over Force (strength, endurance), Grace (speed, coordination) and Brain
                                            (intellect, perception); max 3, min 1. Choose 2 superpowers (subject to GM approval).
                                            Stat Checks: Roll 1d6 per point in matching stat +1d8 if you have matching power.
                                            If you have an advantage, +1d8. Dice showing 4+ are successes. Hard tasks need
                                            1 success; extremely hard tasks need 2. For opposed checks both roll; most successes
                                            win. Ties go to the active player (attacker, searcher, etc). Combat: Characters
                                            take turns in a random order. Each turn, do one thing (move, attack, give advantage).
                                            When attacking, roll an opposed check. If attacker wins, defender takes 1 damage.
                                            Damage reduces a stat (defender's choice); 0 Force means knocked out. 5 minutes
                                            rest removes all damage. Character Advancement: Each issue completed gives 1
                                            XP. Pay XP equal to a stat to increase it by 1; pay XP equal to your number of
                                            superpowers to gain another one. NPC's: To create an NPC, just assign their stats
                                            (no limits) and powers.

                                            you are... Stinkmouth: Power of Super Halitosis. Deadman: Power to convincingly
                                            fake death. One player is the Supervillain, responsible for creation and control
                                            of an evil persona, agenda, and scenario. Remaining players create heroes with
                                            weird quirks, forming a group of misfits attempting to foil the Supervillain.
                                            Each hero starts with 4d6, each die representing 1 willpower. The Supervillain
                                            describes the scenario. Heroes narrate their actions starting at HQ, going to
                                            the scene, and confronting the villain. Play continues in an open-ended, storytelling
                                            format. All heroic actions require a willpower roll (all die required): Any 1:
                                            Failure, -1 willpower Any 6 (with any 1s): [See "Any 1"] and gain a Narrative
                                            advantage Any 5 or 6 (without 1s): Success All die same number (exception 1s):
                                            Success, gain 1 willpower All else: Failure Heroes narrate successes and failures.
                                            Heroes with no willpower are unconscious. Heroes may bolster each other with
                                            a speech, passing one of their willpower to another hero. Supervillains may only
                                            force heroic rolls with their actions (require dodging), or narratively move
                                            the plot forward.

                                            player across from you, your Judge, will decide which action you take. It is
                                            up to you to portray that action: how you go about it, how it makes you feel.
                                            Continue until your unfinished business is resolved. When everyone has called

                                            One player is the GM. Everyone else is a mighty hero of powerful emotions. Have one bright die, one dark die. Players: Write
                                            down your name and the things most important to your character. GM: Set the scene
                                            of danger, focusing on one character. Roll the dice - high die determines whether
                                            the scene mood is bright or dark. Escalate the danger. Continue escalation until
                                            the player picks up the die themselves. You cannot permanently break or kill
                                            anything a player has written. Players: React and roleplay the action. The active
                                            player will pick up the dice when this has gone far enough. Roll them, noting
                                            bright or dark high. Narrate how you overcome danger for the moment, keeping
                                            in mind the die mood. If no die is above 3, your actions have consequences in
                                            the next scene. GM: Decide whether to end the scene, or continue with the focus
                                            on a different player. Next: New danger scene from the GM, or 'player asks' scene.
                                            If 'player asks', asking player gives dice to active player and asks how a past
                                            or new danger or obstacle was overcome. Active player rolls dice and narrates
                                            as above. Continue scenes until the story ends.

                                            ability to plan in advance. During setup, roll 7d10 and save rolls within your
                                            range. Spend one die to automatically pass an Improv test. Every rank above 0
                                            increases your range by one, starting at 10 at rank 1. Improv is your ability
                                            to perform under pressure. When you test Improv, roll d10s equal to your rank.
                                            The roll is successful if any die is 9 or greater. At rank 0, roll 2d10 and take

                                            detail of the heist. For every 1, the GM describes an unhelpful detail. Once
                                            setup is finished, players begin narrating how their characters accomplish the
                                            heist. The GM presents obstacles and calls for Improv tests to challenge the

                                            of Spades; 4 Red Wires; Each player draws four cards from the Tarot Deck and
                                            two from the Interaction Deck. Everyone takes a Red Wire. The youngest player
                                            starts and chooses a Tarot, puts it on the table and narrates a scene in which
                                            his Character is the Protagonist, drawing inspiration from the image of the card.
                                            After him, clockwise, the second does the same, and so on, until everyone completes
                                            three scenes. The players must place the Tarots one after the other, in four
                                            lines converging at the Fourth Scene, the Final, where all the Characters meet.
                                            Each player can modify a scene of another, using an Interaction Card: Jack, Queen,
                                            King and Ace of Hearts indicate, respectively, an ally, a lover, a benevolent
                                            authority, a struck of luck. The corresponding seeds of Spades are the opposite
                                            negative. The Characters cannot meet until the Final, unless a player uses the
                                            Red Wire to connect a newly played card with the last played card of another.
                                            Thus, two Characters can act in the same scene.

                                            This game is best played in around a campfire. You will need two to five adventurers, one player as the Wilds, and ten index
                                            cards each. You are adventurers who have chosen to leave lives of comfort for
                                            the promise of discovery and riches. Each adventurer writes one aspect or artefact
                                            from their past on each of their cards then describes themselves to their allies.
                                            The Wilds writes one aspect of the untamed lands on each of their cards. Begin
                                            play leaving a town bordering the wilds. Take turns describing your advance.
                                            The Wilds will respond either: "The Wilds yield" - The next adventurer may take
                                            an action "The Wilds resists" - The Wilds presents an impeding aspect. Each adventurer
                                            must overcome it with one of their cards. All players sacrifice and burn that
                                            aspect. After the first and fifth sacrifices, make camp. Rest. Discuss what you
                                            have lost, how you have changed. You may choose to return home. After the final
                                            sacrifice, camp. Rest, and discuss how you have been changed. Then, each remaining
                                            adventurer chooses: Return to town and prepare another expedition, or go forth,
                                            letting the wilds consume you. The Wilds describes how the land has been changed
                                            forever.

                                            One person plays as some form of interrogator (detective, school principal, CIA agent, etc.) and the remaining players act
                                            as the interrogees (suspect, student, etc.). Before the start, the players mutually
                                            upon the scenario of the interrogation. The interrogator will start the interrogation
                                            and will ask questions that go through the who, what, where, when, how, and why
                                            of the alleged crime. The interrogator and the interrogees will each have a 1d6
                                            (A single 1d6 is shared among the interrogees). Each number on the die represents
                                            a form of evidence that can be presented that will give momentum of the interrogation
                                            to that person. The higher the number, the stronger the evidence. If presented,
                                            the opposing player can either allow the momentum to swing or present their own
                                            evidence that refutes the evidence if it is a higher number. A player can also
                                            use the same number to refute the evidence, and momentum will be decided on a
                                            head-to-head roll. If a player uses a piece of evidence, they can no longer use
                                            that number on the die for evidence or on a head-to-head roll.

                                            A friend of mine gave me a prompt and I worked to write about it without using it. Lately, I have been reading more horror
                                            stories, and combining that with my attempts at exploring parts of myself and
                                            things I struggle to understand through art. I think I made a game that helps
                                            explain how I feel about answers, that sometimes they just can't be reached because
                                            they are gone and no longer around. It is horrible how we can feel about things
                                            we just can't know. Then there is that whole thing where sometimes hearing the
                                            answer leads to an unsatisfactory ending, any reason can feel like it is never
                                            close to enough to satisfy us. We don't always know why, but the best chance
                                            of moving forward is what we do now with the resources around us and the cards
                                            already on the table. We can't work with what we can never have. The end question
                                            for this game I guess is: How do we find closure in the time we have left when
                                            we do get the answers to what we ask? And those answers do not change what has
                                            happened.

                                            As your group sits down for a night of RPG fun, the apocalypse begins. The nature of the apocalypse is determined by the
                                            group and can be anything from zombie invasions to natural disasters. Determine
                                            three consequences your selected apocalypse has on your surroundings (ex: severe
                                            flooding, enemies roaming the streets, etc). Pick a location at least one mile
                                            from your current position that all players are familiar with. That location
                                            is your safe house. Your goal is to navigate to the safe house while surviving
                                            the apocalypse. Your ability to succeed is determined by your real-life capabilities.
                                            Abilities: Some tasks require physical skills to complete. To complete the task,
                                            the player must perform a comparable action out of game. To vault a table in-game,
                                            you must prove that you can jump as high as said table out of game. To dive underwater
                                            and retrieve an item in-game, you must hold your breath for the same amount of
                                            time out of game. Provisions: Everything in your vicinity is fair use. Craft:
                                            If a player wants to combine or re-purpose their provisions, they must describe
                                            the process to create their desired product as well as succeed on an appropriate
                                            ability check.

                                            Requirements: 1 Wizard, Many Apprentices, Art Supplies The apprentices, children and adults, are finishing their final trial.
                                            They must create their specialty magic. Magic is done in drawings, or other physical
                                            (non-verbal) means. You are their supportive teacher. First, ask them what kind
                                            of magic they want to give the world. Have them draw it out and share it once
                                            everyone is done. Don't focus on quality. Focus on synthesis of ideas. Discuss.
                                            The first try rarely succeeds, it often lacks confidence or reference. Now they
                                            have inspiration from their peers. Have them remake their original, but more
                                            complex, and share it with everyone. Discuss. The second try goes better, but
                                            is often too broad, lacking something that makes it their own. Have them remake
                                            their second try with something that makes it truly special to them (not necessarily
                                            unique) and share it with everyone. Discuss. The third try is almost perfect.
                                            We often forget to look back at our old ideas and retrieve what we left behind.
                                            Have them take all three tries and combine them in to one, focusing on their
                                            thought processes throughout all three. Have everyone share their completed specialty.
                                            Discuss. Encourage pride in their work.

                                            A game for a Baby-Sitter and a few naughty Kids. The Kids' parents are out tonight ; they've hired a Baby-Sitter. She has
                                            3d6 Zen Points (ZP). The Kids are 2d6+3 years old. * Pick a name. * Pick one
                                            adjective (e.g.: *sneaky*, *dirty*, *loud*, *whiny*, *gluttonous*, etc.), it
                                            gives them an Advantage for their Naughty Deeds. * d8 Trust Points (TP). The

                                              Advantage means roll 2d20 and keep the lowest. Success: the Kid narrates what
                                              happens and how it makes the Baby-Sitter mad at you ; she loses d6 ZP. When her
                                              Zen Points goes below zero, she goes crazy. Narrate how she loses control of
                                              everything and gives up her duty. The Kids are then free to do whatever they
                                              want, until their parents come back. Failure: * the Baby-Sitter caught you and
                                              narrates + gains d6 ZP. * you lose d4 TP. * If your TP goes below zero, you 're shoved to your bed. You cannot attempt any Naughty Deed during this scene. Roll d20 > your age to recover d6 TP.

After 5 scenes, the parents are back.

                                                Basilisk. Choose someone to control the narrative - flip a card from the

                                                the action, and a new Tarot card is flipped. If the Tarot card's number matches
                                                the result you just rolled, you have discovered the lair of the basilisk.
                                                Describe your attack, and roll once more. If at least one player remains
                                                after this roll, you've defeated the basilisk. If you've all been petrified,

                                                Autumn. Sunburnt hills under heartbreaking skies. Soil rich and bitter as chocolate. Trees groaning with half-fermented fruit,
                                                leaves turned flaming hues, beasts fatted for the slaughter. People here
                                                live decadently. The land feeds them, and they thrive. But it comes at a
                                                cost. Tonight, the land must be fed in turn: thirsty soil watered with blood.
                                                First, though, a feast. For each reveler, choose a craft (butcher, winemaker,
                                                orchard-keeper, etc) and think about their look (use colour, texture, smell,
                                                animal imagery). Starting with whoever last touched the soil, introduce your
                                                reveler. Describe the gift they bring to the feast: what it is, how it looks,
                                                how it was made. Now, begin play. Make merry: converse, eat & drink, swap
                                                stories, sing, dance, slip away seeking privacy. Frame scenes and take turns
                                                as the mood takes you. Remember, make everything lush, morbid, and visceral.
                                                When you all agree it's time, the party ends. The killing-time has come.
                                                Each reveler votes for who should feed the land. If you are chosen, describe
                                                your death. The others describe how they prosper this year. If there is a
                                                tie, famine comes. All describe how the land turns sour and brings you low.

                                                Find a blank notebook to turn into the Book of Fables. Write everything after this sentence into the first page of the book,
                                                they are the rules that you must follow afterwards. This is the Book of Fables,
                                                and you are now its keeper. If you are not the first keeper of the book,
                                                read the stories in the book for inspiration. Now write a fable of your own
                                                into the book. A fable is a story with a moral lesson. State that lesson
                                                in the last sentence of your tale, this is "the moral of the story". Now
                                                find a student. Teach your fable to your student. To teach them, tell them
                                                your story, but do not state or explain the moral of the story. Your student
                                                must learn the moral from listening to your story and asking questions. Explain
                                                these rules to them now. You may teach other stories from the book at your
                                                discretion; you must teach your own story. When your student has demonstrated
                                                sufficient wisdom, give them the book and ask them to continue the tradition
                                                written within it. They are the new keeper of the Book of Fables, and you
                                                have fulfilled your duty.

                                                for each card beyond the second in a deck challenge. The heist is over when

                                                with the treasure. Players may challenge the leader with what's left of their
                                                hands or give the leader their cards in exchange for a share.

                                                3-6 players. A shuffled Tarot deck. One player is the CATACLYSM. They describe the setting and a sense of the potential cataclysm,
                                                large or small. The other players are LUMINARIES seeking to avoid calamity.
                                                Each describes their character. Deal ten cards to the CATACLYSM in a stack.
                                                Deal ten cards to each LUMINARY'S hand. Each LUMINARY plays a card from their
                                                hand and describes a plan to prevent the cataclysm. Cups - Environmental

                                                Arcana are wild and can describe any plan. The CATACLYSM plays the top card
                                                in their stack. Page = 11, Knight = 12, Queen = 13, King = 14. The LUMINARIES
                                                temporarily succeed if: 1. They played a card of the same suit AND a higher
                                                rank than the CATACLYSM, or 2. They played a Major Arcana of higher rank.
                                                If the CATACLYSM played a Major Arcana, so must have the LUMINARIES to succeed.
                                                Discard all cards played. If the LUMINARIES succeed, the CATACLYSM discards
                                                their next card. Otherwise, all LUMINARIES discard one card from their hands.
                                                The CATACLYSM narrates the continuing cataclysm. If all players have cards,
                                                a new round begins. The loser has no cards remaining. The victor narrates

                                                which will make the whole system uninhabitable. Recently, your captain has
                                                caught an unknown illness and is being kept in stasis until a cure is discovered.
                                                During this time, the commanders have been put in charge of the ship. Player's
                                                will create their own commander by giving them a name and choosing its race
                                                (human, alien or anything else). They will then decide if the commander gets
                                                a Physical Boost or a Mental Boost. When a commander attempts something that

                                                the matching boost for the skill check, they can add 1 to the result. If
                                                the result is 4 or higher, they complete the task safely. Otherwise, The

                                                The main idea is to encourage the players to willingly engage with the inevitable mixture of failure that's baked into the
                                                system, taking on a more directorial / story-teller kind of role, creating
                                                a journey filled with ups-and-downs as opposed to a meteoric rise to success.
                                                I think it's interesting to explore different ideas of what players in a
                                                game should actually be making choices about - here, the focus is on deciding
                                                if (and to what extend) a character's approach works, rather then on what
                                                the action itself should be. The die/token economy enforces some kind of
                                                dramatic pacing. It's up to the players to decide when/if the hero is victorious,
                                                or if failure is ultimately inevitable. Based on mechanics alone (stripping
                                                away the thematic prompts), it tends to end up in a bit of a farce or comedy
                                                of errors, and works especially well for things like a heist or fairytale
                                                quest, which are structured as a straightforward "gauntlet" of obstacles.
                                                I've attempted to create a different atmosphere with the fluff/flavour here.

                                                This game is based primarily on the song The Dead Flag Blues by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, but inspired by the entire album
                                                F♯ A♯ ∞. It has been designed to be a social game of chance built into a
                                                roleplaying game about a group of survivors' futile and vain attempt to negotiate
                                                the death of the world around them. There is no frame of reference of time
                                                for this. Each turn could be an hour in the outbreak of a pathogen, a day
                                                in a nuclear apocalypse, or a month in a global socioeconomic collapse. Zombies,
                                                robots, aliens. It is up to the group and (probably) the player who goes
                                                first. This game cannot be "won" and (statistically) everyone will die eventually.
                                                Over time, players will lose more dice than they gain. When the group is
                                                reduced to tbe last player, they will effectively simply lose one Life every
                                                turn (as there is no longer "others" from whom to give/take Life) until they
                                                die, too. This may be fun to play out anyway, for dramatic effect.

                                                Players take the role of an adventurer in a dragon's den. You need a gamemaster and at least one player. Gamemasters control
                                                the dragon and decide if rolls succeed. The goal of the game is to neutralize
                                                the dragon via murder or appeasement. Players begin by drawing seven cards.
                                                There are five different cards that determine play. Charisma cards let you
                                                roll to charm the dragon. Strength cards let you roll to kill him. Endurance
                                                cards let you roll to take straight-up damage from fire breath. Dodge cards
                                                let you roll to get out of his way. To roll you use a d20. The dragon will
                                                always attack you on his turn until neutralized. He can either snarl, bite,
                                                or breathe fire based on which dragon card the gamemaster draws. When he
                                                snarls, you discard two of your cards. When he bites, you take 10 damage.
                                                When he breathes fire, you take 10 damage for your next three turns (on a
                                                succeeded Endurance roll you take 15 straight-up). You begin with 125/125
                                                HP. Damage lowers your HP until you die. Player draw one card per turn. The
                                                cover card lets you draw two cards on your turn.

                                                Kiesha is asleep, and having a nightmare. You, her loyal Dream Thieves, are sworn to help bring her peace. But in so doing,
                                                you must preserve her dream's purpose -- as a lesson, portent, etc. Vision

                                                and passing to the right, until everyone has a vivid picture, and there is
                                                a clear, present problem for the Thieves to solve. Describe the dream through

                                                what you change, in the dream world or otherwise, to address the problem,
                                                partially or completely, then ask the player to your right a loaded question
                                                about your actions: "Why does this confuse Kiesha?" "What does Kiesha portend
                                                now?" "Why do I stop just short?" Assume the Thief's action works as intended.
                                                If the answer leaves no problem, start another Vision Phase, starting with
                                                the player on the answerer's right. When finished, the player to the Thief's
                                                left starts a new Thief Phase. Once everyone has taken at least one Thief
                                                Phase, anyone may call an end to the dream by saying how they wake Kiesha
                                                in their Thief Phase. How does she greet the day?

                                                You've been dreaming of a golden city for several nights. You tried hard to reach its mysterious glowing towers, but every
                                                time you woke up. Tonight, you decided to go to Kadath, where lies the Dream
                                                Gods, for them to bring you to the city. Just, wait... What is Kadath, exactly
                                                ? During that night, your friends assume the role of the nefastuous Dream
                                                Gods. They only want you to fail : one cannot defy their authority ! You
                                                have ten tokens to assign. They can be Lucidity, its your implication in
                                                the Dream. When you run out of them, you wake up and the game is over. Try
                                                another night ! Tokens can also be Imagination. They allow you to influence
                                                what happens in the Dream. Only Dream Gods can decide what you encounters
                                                during your journey to Kadath. If there is danger, roll a dice. Even, you're
                                                safe. Odd, you lose some Lucidity. You can decide to lose one Imagination
                                                and automatically succeed. Each token spent makes the Gods angry : the Dream
                                                becomes Nightmare. You might encounter friend like Cats of Ulthar but be
                                                very careful of the enigmatic Dholes, who can take any form and substance

                                                Criters, and there is a Forest King (Storyteller) that as to be a kid with
                                                less than 12 years old. RULES: 1 - The Forest King tells the story and challenge
                                                the players by question them what they want to do. Every question has a roll
                                                that will determin the success of that task. 2 - The Criters listen to the
                                                story and answer the questions, favouring the story. 3 - The Forest King
                                                will use the roll of the player to keep the story going. PLAYERS CHARACTERS:
                                                Players may choose an animal, and for each one they must choose a POWER and
                                                a NONSENSE... and of course a NAME. CHALLENGES: The success of a challenge
                                                will be determined by the number of your roll. If the roll is higher than
                                                1, then its a success. If it is a 1, it's a failure and the Forest King has
                                                to incorporate the NONSENSE of that character in the story. However, if it's
                                                a 6, the player may invoke his POWER and describe the resolution of that

                                                In this game, you take the role, of a person, all do know him a group of Bards recounting their tales In the form of an epic
                                                poem Each player must simply choose a name, and an adjective they attribute
                                                to their character. The Lead Bard functions as a game master, and starts
                                                the poem with a short rhyme detailing where they are and what they need to
                                                do. From then on, the group sits in a circle and tells the story, the lead
                                                bard says a line, ("The group sat by the mountainside, when they saw a sallow
                                                man"), To which a bard reply with their action or speech ("I walked over
                                                merrily, to offer him a hand"). The lead bard will sing every other line,
                                                and the group take turns replying in a circle. If a bard is unable to make
                                                a rhyme, or if 10 seconds pass, the interaction goes unfavorably. If the
                                                bard makes a rhyme, it goes well. If the Bard makes a rhyme and his action
                                                plays to his adjective, The Lead bard may choose to reward him, pointing
                                                at him while saying his line as a gesture to reply to him again.

                                                modern-day to sci-fi. Pre-game: Players write character backstories and give
                                                the GM a copy. Characters have 4 stats: - Power - Agility - Charm - Wit At

                                                using their backstory as inspiration. Each point is worth 1d6 for skill checks.
                                                Players must beat a DC depending on the difficulty of the check. During game:

                                                Players announce an existing part of their backstory and say how that will
                                                give them an advantage in that situation - Players announce a new part of

                                                that gives them an advantage, and permanently add it to their backstory -
                                                The GM announce something from the player's backstory, giving them a disadvantage
                                                to the particular check. When this happens, the GM can choose to add or take
                                                away one point from all future checks of that type.

                                                have been programmed to destroy embryo stores. An AI rebels against the order

                                                new technologies, giving a black die to the AI player. Whenever you face
                                                a danger, both of you roll only the dice that have been delivered to you.
                                                If the sum of the white dice score exceeds that of the black dice, you dodge
                                                it. Otherwise, you have been captured and destroyed.

I was inspired by the classic kung fu movie trope of the obtuse Master teaching the clueless Apprentice to wax-on-wax-off. I liked the dynamic of one person knowing so much and trying to get another to understand what they're teaching them. </p>

                                                    If they run out of guesses, the Horror manifests and the characters are

                                                    using chess rules. White Queen responds. When both Queens have moved,

                                                    If a Queen dies or 33 years pass, the war never ends. If Checkmate occurs,
                                                    the war ends. If the queens meet in adjacent squares, a truce begins.
                                                    If a pawn traverses to the opposite end of the board, the war ends peacefully.

                                                    disappointment card and worshiper card to each player. E.g. worshiper:
                                                    Dave the librarian, a rock, Stacy the space weasel. E.g. disappointments:
                                                    bone cancer in children, lack of free will, no meaning in existence,
                                                    no tacos on taco tuesday. The gods first introduce each other by name
                                                    and domain eg: Halfnir - Lord of Pretty Lies Goldren - Mast of the Liminal
                                                    Plang'nar - The Cosmic Leaf In order each god gives a short biography
                                                    of their worshiper. Why the worshiper follows their god? How did they
                                                    die? One other god reveals a disappointment card then describes the moment
                                                    the follower experienced the disappointment. The worshiper's god must
                                                    explain why the disappointment was necessary. The gods vote on the justification.
                                                    If the disappointment is judged justified, smite the worshiper and disappointment
                                                    in accordance to your doctrine. Save surviving worshipers and disappointments
                                                    for future games.

                                                        pool equals one. Gamemaster's pool is determined by how difficult

                                                        pool plus target equals NPC's health. Dice equal or lower than target

                                                        ones during a challenge equals critical success. All sixes on initial
                                                        roll equals critical failure. Both sides roll and count successes,
                                                        higher total of successes overcomes. Tiebreakers are - highest target,
                                                        largest adjusted pool, largest unadjusted pool, still tied equals
                                                        failure. Initiative challenge; tie equals simultaneous action. Combat
                                                        challenge; loser subtracts health equal to difference in successes,
                                                        same number of successes equals no damage. Zero health equals unconsciousness.

                                                            This is a universal, diceless RPG, suitable for any setting or genre. You have a character who is represented by a potato.
                                                            When you wish for your character to accomplish something risky
                                                            and consequential, you must take a substantial bite of your potato.
                                                            If the bite of potato you have taken leaves your mouth before

                                                            the action succeeds. If it is the LAST bite of your potato, the

                                                            Again, players select one word to keep, passing the rest to their

                                                            word is obsolete, still in use, or newly coined. Once the last

                                                            men in uniform, shouting, and she screamed and they took her
                                                            away. You don't know why. You don't know where she is. Now you
                                                            are in a car. You don't know where you're going. There is one

                                                            them before. They do not speak your language. Player: put a die
                                                            in a cup and turn the cup upside down. This is your situation.
                                                            The higher the number, the worse it is. You don't know what it
                                                            is because you can't see the die. GM: look at the die. Behave
                                                            accordingly, or not. You're just driving the player somewhere.
                                                            But you must prevent the player from seeing the number on the

                                                            the player. The GM now reveals the number and describes what
                                                            happens at the end of the journey. The player is reunited with
                                                            their mother if the GM lifts the cup and the die has disappeared.

                                                            heard spoken, feeling the emotions that have been felt near it.
                                                            The nature of the objects in this game is to be significant,
                                                            but they can vary from grandiose objects that travel great distances
                                                            to items that only matter to a few people. They'll see interesting
                                                            events, for sure. The tables are a bit weird. I deliberately
                                                            designed them to include broad yet specific terms, which are
                                                            not mutually exclusive (though in some cases they may cause you
                                                            to think for a while to come up with something). Because they're
                                                            selected secretly, you'll all get a little bit of what you wanted,
                                                            but the whole will be something you might not predict. The timeline
                                                            isn't strictly necessary, but I think it will help preserve a
                                                            sense of the object as having a history, which is what you're
                                                            really exploring here. It's a bit like Microscope, a game I love.

                                                            ### A world-building game for any number of players *This is How it Happened* creates a setting with a rich history that
                                                            all of the players are invested in. The resulting setting can
                                                            be used as the seed of another role-playing game. Players take
                                                            turns: step one always comes first, and step two always comes
                                                            after that. After step two you start with step one again. ##
                                                            1. One thing happens. The player says one thing that happened,
                                                            ideally in a single sentence. You can enforce the strictness
                                                            of the one-sentence limit as tightly or as loosely as you wish.
                                                            ## 2. Some time passes. The next player decides what unit of
                                                            time has passed. The player should say whether an hour, a day,
                                                            a week, a month, a season, a year, a decade, or a century has
                                                            gone by. ## That's it. Add wrinkles or random chance to the game:
                                                            1. Roll 1d8 to determine which increment of time has passed in
                                                            step two. 2. Draw a tarot card and explain how it fits in step
                                                            one. 3. Roll on any random table in an RPG sourcebook. 4. Let
                                                            a child take a turn. 5. Try something else!

                                                            This was based on wanting to make a one-shot RPG system based on a historical event that is known of but yet has poor representation.
                                                            I picked forced-labour camps, specifically the gulags. This setting
                                                            was especially useful as the conflict already exists in the setting:
                                                            I.E. Trying not to be worked to death or starve. I wanted to

                                                            a lot of wiggle room for many settings, even if not historical.
                                                            It is simply trying to get players to survive in a forced-labour

                                                            I had this idea a while back: using cards and a jenga tower to create excitement and luck. The cards was part of a unique
                                                            card deck and the rule book was about 8 pages describing a lot
                                                            of additional rules and the setting. When I heard about this
                                                            challenge it was easy to cut out all the complicated and unecessary
                                                            stuff out and the end result is so much better. There's no reason
                                                            to complicate things trying to avoid dices and if that's the
                                                            case the alternative should be better, which a Jenga tower is
                                                            for this horror/survival setting. All in all cutting out pretty

                                                            good giggles. Hats off to my wonderful family for inspiring me

                                                            affect lives. Perhaps you are a powerful sorcerer, the president,

                                                            on how you got there and if you like where you ended up, is an

                                                            from the rabble of the pleeblands. But maybe there's a way out?
                                                            Think of a card: this is your warrant. Write it down and keep
                                                            it secret. Get fired with this card in hand, and you win. Draw
                                                            a pool of clients (players x2) face up. Everyone draws 3 cards
                                                            from the draw deck to have in hand. Each player in turn picks
                                                            a client to clear by playing cards of the same suit; equal or
                                                            greater value clears. Other players can contribute anonymously,
                                                            but the wrong suit counts down! If you succeed, you can either
                                                            let them pass into the cleared pile or take them for yourself.
                                                            Have more or equal cleared clients than failed at the end of
                                                            the day, or you're all fired! Played cards and cleared cards
                                                            are discarded at the end of the day. Failed cards and cards in
                                                            hand are re-shuffled into the draw deck. Another day starts,
                                                            until the draw deck is empty or anyone cannot draw a full three
                                                            cards in the morning. Shuffle deck. Begin again. Work together.
                                                            Trust no-one.

                                                            up to anyone else and ask to do one of these rituals, in this

                                                            Move like flowing water, slowly, gently. Watch: Lie down, look

                                                            Run: Hold hands, close eyes, walk together in straight line until
                                                            someone gets scared. Vent: Take turns being quiet for 5 minutes
                                                            while other player talks. Roll: Lock arms on ground and gently
                                                            wrestle. Promise: Tie grass around wrists, make promises you
                                                            can't keep. Scream: Get away from everyone else and take turns

                                                            chooses one. The Blasphemer describes their actions. If success
                                                            is uncertain, the Blasphemer closes their eyes and a die is rolled.

                                                            on a correct call. The Whisper whose command was chosen has their

                                                            becomes a Whisper. The Dark describes the result of the action.

                                                            This was fun to make. My only regret was not being able to fit

                                                            You are playing a children's card game about monsters. The fate of the universe is in the balance, somehow. The rules are...fuzzy.
                                                            Use a standard deck. Start with 5 cards. Draw 1 each turn. Hearts
                                                            are Monsters. Spades are Traps. Clubs are Magic. Diamonds are
                                                            Wild. Write the following rules on a sheet: 0. You may only summon
                                                            one monster a turn. 0. Monsters attack once a turn. 0. Traps
                                                            must be played facedown and triggered later 0. Magic and traps
                                                            don't do anything 0. You must play cards for things to happen.
                                                            When you play a card explain what it is. You may, at any time,
                                                            overwrite a rule or introduce a new one. Write it on the sheet
                                                            and put a number one greater than the previous rule. Roll d6
                                                            equal to that number. If you don't roll any ones, all good. If
                                                            you do, your opponent can immediately react to negate your action.
                                                            Monster face cards have special abilities. Make them up when
                                                            relevant. Other face cards remove one d6 from a roll to introduce
                                                            new rules (minimum of one). Aces always roll one d6 to introduce
                                                            new rules. Play until you decide it's getting old.
