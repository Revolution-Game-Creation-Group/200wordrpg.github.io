# The 200 Word Challenge Returns in 2018! 

Last year was incredible and this year is looking to be bigger and better than ever. 
We are seeking **4-5 Judges, 30-40 Readers**, and **Prizes Donated by the community**. 

### Timeline:

* **February - April**: Seeking Judges, Readers, and Prizes
* **May 18th**: Submissions open
* **May 28th**: Submissions close, judging begins
* **July 1st**: Winners announced

### Apply to be a Reader:
This year we will have a large group of "Readers" to help narrow down the entries for the Judges. Every entry will be read by at least two different Readers. The top 50 entries will then be passed to the Judges for final consideration.

Readers must be:
* **Dependable.** The reader must commit to reading 100 entries and submit their top choices within the review period (May 30 - Jun 13).
Readers will have 2 weeks to pick their top entries. Expect to commit 8-10 hours to read through all of the entries (about an hour a day).
* **Impartial.** The reader should be open and honest about potential conflicts of interest.

### Apply to be a Judge:
We will be selecting judges to ensure a diverse set of viewpoints, both professionally and personally. Judges will determine the top 3 winners from among the finalists.

Judges must be:
* **Dependable.** The judge must commit to carefully reading about 50 entries and attending 2 Judge Deliberation Meetings. Expect to commit 3-4 hours to read through all of the entries. Each meeting will be about 2 hours long. 
* **Affable.** The judge should be easy to work with and willing to work with the other judges toward a mutually-agreeable set of winners. 
* **Impartial.** The judge should be open and honest about potential conflicts of interest and willing to recuse themselves when necessary.
* **Genuine.** The judge should bring their own tastes, perspectives, and enthusiasm to the judging process.

### Donate a Prize:
We hope to offer prizes donated by the community. Digital prizes are prefereble (Game PDFs, Design tools, etc). 

We are seeking several categories of prizes:
* **Winners (3 prizes)**: Large prizes for the Top 3 Winners. There is no 1st, 2nd, or 3rd prize, simply the Top 3.
* **Finalists (50-ish prizes)**: Smaller prizes to reward the finalists for making it past the Reader selection.
* **Readers and Judges (40-ish prizes)**: Smaller Prizes to reward the effort and dedication of the Readers and Judges.

Please email davidschirduan @ gmail.com if you have a prize you would like to donate.

# Design a role-playing game using 200 words or less.

### Why? What is this?

The **200 Word RPG Challenge** exists for two primary reasons:

**1) Encourage participants to make a complete Role-Playing Game**. It's hard to work on a game, and much harder to finish one. This is an opportunity for participants to brainstorm, write, edit, playtest, and polish a game idea from start to finish.

**2) To provide a collection of ideas that the community may build upon.** These entries are released under the [Creative Commons license]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing) to promote collaboration and innovation. It is our hope that new designers and old pros alike will use these interesting ideas and work together to expand them into something greater.

### Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

### Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.

### Connect with other Creators

Making and sharing a game is a great way to showcase your ideas and connect with new and more experienced game designers. Do you see a game that inspires you? The 200 Word RPG Challenge is a forge for new collaborations! Join the subreddit for discussion, collaboration, and feedback.
