# Design a role-playing game using 200 words or less.

## Timeline:

* **May 18th**: Submissions open. 
* **May 28th**: Submissions close.
* **May 30 - June 13**: Each [Reader]({{site.baseurl}}/readers) will be assigned 100 or so entries so that every entry is read by at least two different Readers. Each Reader will submit their top 10 entries, and the **top 50 Finalists** will be selected from the Reader choices.
* **June 14**: [Finalists]({{site.baseurl}}/winners) announced and posted.
* **June 15 - 30**: The [Judges]({{site.baseurl}}/judges) will read through all of the Finalists. The Judges will have two meetings during which they will discuss and determine the **top 3 Winners**.
* **July 1st**: Winners announced, prizes awarded. Organizers sleep until next year.

## Begins May 18th

Entries will be accepted from the beginning of May 18th (00:01 EST) until the end of May 28th (23:99 EST).

Each participant may submit **one** entry. If you submit multiple entries only your **first** entry will be accepted. So make sure to double and triple check everything before you submit.

## 200 Words or Fewer

Each entry may not exceed 200 words. Judges will use the [Site Wordcounter]({{site.baseurl}}/wordcount). Anything above 200 words will be immediately disqualified. **Entries cannot be corrected or changed once they are submitted.**

The title, author name, and so on, will NOT count towards that limit.

## Plaintext

Entries will be submitted entirely in plaintext (ASCII). There will be no formatting of any kind however all entries will be displayed with a mono-space font (so all spacing or ascii art will be preserved).

No emojii's, no chinese characters, etc. Only [Basic Latin Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin) are allowed. <br>*Unicode x0000 through x00FF for the nerds out there.*

## Publicly Posted
Each entry will be publicly posted [on this page]({{site.baseurl}}/2018entries). We reserve the right to reject entries that we consider to be inappropriate or offensive. 

## Licensing
All entries will be submitted under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License. That means that anyone can remix, modify, expand, or build upon these entries, and even make money off of them! [More info here]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing).

### Why? What is this?

The **200 Word RPG Challenge** exists for two primary reasons:

**1) Encourage participants to make a complete Role-Playing Game**. It's hard to work on a game, and much harder to finish one. This is an opportunity for participants to brainstorm, write, edit, playtest, and polish a game idea from start to finish.

**2) To provide a collection of ideas that the community may build upon.** These entries are released under the [Creative Commons license]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing) to promote collaboration and innovation. It is our hope that new designers and old pros alike will use these interesting ideas and work together to expand them into something greater.

### Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

### Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.

### Connect with other Creators

Making and sharing a game is a great way to showcase your ideas and connect with new and more experienced game designers. Do you see a game that inspires you? The 200 Word RPG Challenge is a forge for new collaborations! Join the subreddit for discussion, collaboration, and feedback.
