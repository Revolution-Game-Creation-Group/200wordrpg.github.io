# Design a role-playing game using 200 words or less.

### Why? What is this?

The **200 Word RPG Challenge** exists for two primary reasons:

**1) Encourage participants to make a complete Role-Playing Game**. It's hard to work on a game, and much harder to finish one. This is an opportunity for participants to brainstorm, write, edit, playtest, and polish a game idea from start to finish.

**2) To provide a collection of ideas that the community may build upon.** These entries are released under the [Creative Commons license]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing) to promote collaboration and innovation. It is our hope that new designers and old pros alike will use these interesting ideas and work together to expand them into something greater.

### Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

### Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.

### Connect with other Creators

Making and sharing a game is a great way to showcase your ideas and connect with new and more experienced game designers. Do you see a game that inspires you? The 200 Word RPG Challenge is a forge for new collaborations! Join the subreddit for discussion, collaboration, and feedback.
