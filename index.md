# Design a role-playing game using 200 words or less.

The 200 Word RPG Challenge is a small tabletop game design competition.

**Submissions are open from now until May 28th! Scroll down for more details.**

### Why? What is this?

This little challenge exists for two primary reasons:

**1) Encourage participants to make a complete Role-Playing Game**. It's hard to work on a game, and much harder to finish one. This is an opportunity for participants to brainstorm, write, edit, playtest, and polish a game idea from start to finish.

**2) To provide a collection of ideas that the community may build upon.** These entries are released under the [Creative Commons license]({{site.baseurl}}/licensing) to promote collaboration and innovation. It is our hope that new designers and old pros alike will use these interesting ideas and work together to expand them into something greater.

### Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

### Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.

# Entries will be accepted until the end of May 28th (23:99 EST)

Each participant may submit **one** entry. **Entries cannot be corrected or changed once they are submitted.** If you submit multiple entries only your **first** entry will be accepted. So make sure to double and triple check everything before you submit. 

You can view the entries submitted so far [on this page.]({{site.baseurl}}/2018entries)

### 200 Words or Fewer

Each entry may not exceed 200 words. Judges will use the [Site Wordcounter]({{site.baseurl}}/wordcount). Anything above 200 words will be immediately disqualified. The title, author name, and so on, will NOT count towards that limit.

Entries will be submitted entirely in plaintext. More details about text requirements can be found on the [Wordcounter page]({{site.baseurl}}/wordcount).

### Judging Process

This year we have some incredible Judges who will help us find the best of the bunch:

* **Jessica Hammer:** Assistant professor and award-winning game designer.

* **[Assisted by an awesome group of Readers]({{site.baseurl}}/readers)** who will narrow down the entries for the Judges.

**Both Readers and Judges will be evaluating entries based upon the following criteria**:

* **New and Overlooked Stories.** The entry should encourage its players to tell a new kind of story, a story that has often been overlooked, or a familiar story from a new perspective.
* **Engaging.** The game should inspire the reader with ideas and questions. It should make the reader want to play this game as soon as possible.

### Prizes
