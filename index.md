# Design a role-playing game using 200 words or less.

This small tabletop game design challenge encourages **everyone** to make a complete role-playing game. It's hard to work on a game, and much harder to finish one. This is an opportunity for participants to brainstorm, write, edit, playtest, and polish a game idea from start to finish.

## Submissions for 2019 are now closed!

You can view the entries submitted so far [on this page](/2019entries), updated daily. 

**Here's the planned timeline for the rest of the Challenge:**

  <p>The top choice from each Reader earns 5 points, and the next earns 4 points, and so on. It's better to be #3 on two Reader choices than best of a single Reader. The top 50 or so entries with the most points will be the Finalists.</p>

## Winner Criteria
The criteria that Readers and Judges will use to evaluate each entry. All entries submitted are deemed to be role-playing games, and they will be judged on the following merits:

 - **Actionable.** The entry should contain enough information to play the game.
 - **New and Overlooked Stories.** The entry should encourage its players to tell a new kind of story, a story that has often been overlooked, or a familiar story from a new perspective.
 - **Engaging.** The game should inspire the reader with ideas and questions. It should make the reader want to play this game as soon as possible.

## Prizes

This year we have a wide array of prizes to offer to the Finalists and Winners including professional layout for the winners and top-quality RPGs and supplements. [Check them out here](/prizes).

## Ethics & Inclusivity

The 200 Word RPG Challenge is a small contest with small stakes where you design small games to win small prizes. It's an inclusive contest that welcomes the submissions of game designers from all walks of life and designers from marginalized communities are especially encouraged to participate! We want to make this a space that is safe for first-time designers, marginalized designers, and designers who struggle in structural and personal ways. Whoever you are, wherever you come from, we're happy to have you.

Helping everyone to feel welcome means working together to help everyone feel safe and treating others with consideration and respect. Harassment, intimidation, and hate speech are not acceptable. We will not tolerate discrimination based on race, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual preference, mental health and ability, physical health and ability, size, ethnicity, nationality, or refugee status. The organizers reserve the right to refuse contest submissions, prize donations, and service offers based on these values. 

Also for the first time this year we allow entries to include Content Warnings. We hope this will make the challenge safer for everyone to enjoy.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact our organizers at **200wordrpg@gmail.com**.

## Why 200 Words?

A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, itâ€™s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

Got a neat idea? Use our **[Wordcounter]({{site.baseurl}}/wordcounter)** to check your entry. Cutting a game down to 200 words is difficult! Good luck.

## Plaintext?

Visual presentation can be a large and scary problem. Very few people are masters of writing, editing, art direction, graphic design, layout, and marketing. It usually takes a village to make a game. We want participants to focus solely on the challenge of creative writing and brutal editing.
