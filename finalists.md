# #WinterIntoSpring

```
Split 4+ players between contentious "Minority"/"Majority" factions.  

You're fashionistas vlogging before and after Revolution. 

DEFINE "Fashion" ("everyday human-ish," "cybernetics," ... ).

Grab any 2 magazines.

Everyone:  Glue together a paperdoll representing your fashionista using body-parts cut from magazines.

To CONSUME Fashion, each faction spends 6 minutes cutting pictures of attire from magazines (clothing, accessories, hairstyles, ...).  Cut hastily, roughly.  Majority cuts first.  Factions keep separate wardrobes.

Every season, each faction picks one word on the flipside of any cutout.  These're TRENDING Revolution-related hashtags.  Interpret their meanings.  Incorporate them during roleplaying.



~WINTER (BEFORE REVOLUTION)~

Consume Fashion.

MINORITY:  Speaking as your fashionistas, roleplay #GetReadyWithMe videos showing morning routines.  Model Fashion on paperdolls.  

	Discuss:

	*Today's agenda.
	*How outfit complements agenda.
	*Vlogosphere drama.

MAJORITY:  Roleplay Holiday #OutfitOfTheDay videos modeling festive Fashion.  

	Discuss:

	*Holiday.
	*How outfit reflects traditions.
	*Family.

CRITIQUE everyone! (clothes fit paperdoll?  accessorized?  ...)



~REVOLUTION!~

Players swap factions!

Discard all Fashion!



~SPRING (AFTER REVOLUTION)~

Consume Fashion.

MINORITY:  Roleplay Holiday #OutfitOfTheDay videos.

	Discuss:

	*Holidays: what's changed?
	*#currentmood.
	*Family.

MAJORITY:  Roleplay #HAUL videos.  Unbox multiple Fashion acquisitions ("shoe haul").

	Discuss:

	*How life's improved.
	*Favorite postrevolutionary brands.
	*Rival vloggers.

Critique everyone!



~!!!~

>After SPRING, return to WINTER.  Check magazines:

>>Fashion scarcity?  REDEFINE Fashion ("No more clothes?  Wear flesh.")

>>Empty?  End.

        End your turn - Change a hand.
        Choose the position that best reflects your thoughts.
                Palm up - I still feel guilty.
                Palm down - You're not at fault.
                Switch hand location - You may be at fault.

End of round:

# It's Always Been a Dive"





```
You are employees in a seedy dive bar, churning through concepts, owners, and crimes. Requires: Index cards; pool of 5 Mismanagement tokens per player.

Players take turns writing the Dive's Features on cards: Name, Theme, Clientele, House Special, Secret. Players create two Employees each, with: Name, Position, Descriptor, Vice. Each player starts with one character Employed; set the others aside as Unemployed.

One player (the Owner) watches the other players play a scene in the Dive (~3 minutes). The Owner awards one Mismanagement each for: Encouraging others' Vices; abusing their Position; creating conflicts between Employees. Track Employees' conflicts and crimes as Baggage. The next player becomes Owner; repeat.

After the Mismanagement pool is half-empty, the Owner may change one Feature per scene as they frantically attempt to salvage the failing Dive.

When all Mismanagement is spent, the Dive fails. Fire the Employee with the most Mismanagement. Strike one of their Baggage items. Play a scene explaining why that Baggage collapsed the Dive. (Re)hire any unemployed character to replace them.

The next Owner rebrands the Dive, changing two Features. Return tokens. Give Employees one Mismanagement per struck-out Baggage. The Dive reopens, continuing until alcohol or ennui overwhelms the players.
```

# Sidewalkia!"





```
One player stands in a square of sidewalk with clearly defined boundaries and shouts: 

"I CLAIM THIS LAND IN THE NAME OF SIDEWALKIA."

This player is now the Prime Minister.

Other players join by declaring their loyalty to SIDEWALKIA. The PM declares each new player a role in the government. 

Each player describes an aspect of SIDEWALKIA's landscape, using real-world landmarks nearby as inspiration. 

Each player describes an unusual, outlandish historical moment of SIDEWALKIA.

Each player declares something that SIDEWALKIA needs to succeed/grow/prevail.

Without leaving the boundaries, look for these things in the world around you. 

To get these things, convince others to join SIDEWALKIA. Chant catchy slogans or sing songs to make passersby smile and join. If your total numbers reach more than 4, expand to another square and redistribute your population how you see fit. CELEBRATE RAUCOUSLY when new citizens join you.

If someone walks through your square, SIDEWALKIA suffers a natural disaster. Describe it, mourn, and rebuild.

If someone pauses, they vacationed in SIDEWALKIA. Describe their vacation experience for them, congratulate yourselves on being a destination.

The game ends if your population reaches 15 or you have expanded to three or more squares of concrete.
```

# Stratus Res"





```
For two players

The two of you have found a moment of peace you have never known.
You rest in each others arms, eyes to the sky.
You hear the water, feel the sun, and smell the growth of new life all around.
You escaped your broken home together to get here, but this place too will be lost before long.

You take this time to tell a story.

Cut out a paper flower with six separate petals.
Begin with touch, whatever level you are comfortable with.
This will be sustained throughout your story.

Your story is about a past.
Not your past, but one much happier.
Free of choking smoke and ash.

Teller, begin the story however you like.

Listener, when the story strays too close to your true past, briefly embrace your partner more tightly.
Sit together in silence and decide for yourself what the true past was.
Then, Listener becomes Teller, picking up the story just before it was left off.

The past holds darkness; the future holds a white void of unknown.
When the story touches on the future, tear one petal off the flower.
When no petals remain, your story is over.

```

# Word/Cross"





```
Find a novel or novels no one cares about. Cut a page from the book for each of the players.

Each player chooses one side of their page.
Each player underlines a word or phrase on their page to be their name.
Each player circles two adjectives on their page to be their signature abilities.

The GM uses the blurb on the back of the book to create the scenario, and describes it to the players.

When you encounter conflict, cross out two-three words on your page, and use these words to describe how you overcome the conflict. 
The words must be used in the order they appear on the page.
The words you use must be relevant to the situation.
For each word you have crossed off, roll a D6. 
You can use your signature abilities without crossing them off to roll a D6, or you can cross them off to roll 2D6. 
On a 10+ you succeed. 
If you fail, cross off a number of lines on your page equal to 10 minus your roll. The GM describes what befalls you.
If you run out of lines on your page, you die.
```

# A Regretful Duel"





```
A game for two players and a coin

You are witnessing a regretful duel.
Each of you speaks for a duelist, though you are not them.

Answer the following about your duelist:
What is their name?
How do others refer to them? (she, they, he, Doctor, Monarch, Professor, etc.)
What do they look like?

Answer the following together:
The duelists were once very close, but something has compelled them to fight. What was it? (an unforgivable deed, an outside force, a regretful responsibility, etc.)
What weapons are being used in this duel? (ancient swords, beautiful songs, forgotten curses, etc.)

Assign one side of the coin to each of the duelists.

Flip the coin.

If your side is face up, describe how your duelist used their weapon to harm the other.
If your side is face down, recount a happy memory that both duelists shared.

Flip the coin and repeat.

The player who wins three coin tosses describes what becomes of the defeated duelist.
The other player describes how the winning duelist copes with what they've done in the time that follows.

Together, talk about a wonderful moment between the duelists that will never arrive because of what has happened here.
```

# Occupational Safety and Health Adventures"





```
You are a team of co-workers. Decide together:
- What is your workplace?
- What big project is the boss breathing down your neck about?
- How is your workplace catastrophically unsafe?

Individually, name your character and decide:
- What is my role on the team? (coordinator, expert, grunt, caretaker, gofer)
- Why do I keep messing up? (lazy, greedy, incompetent, dishonest, arrogant)

Take turns framing scenes starring your character. Everyone else plays their parts and NPCs, as needed. Each scene should lead to a point where one character (not necessarily yours) must risk their safety to move forward with the project. That character's player chooses:
1. Accept the injury. Don't tell the boss.
2. Report the unsafe condition. Tell the other players what new safety rule the boss has imposed. The other players decide how the workspace will be altered to comply with this rule, in a way that makes the workplace less safe and less efficient overall.

The game ends when either:
1. The project is completed. The team is congratulated by the boss for a job well done, and for their good safety record.
2. One character accumulates three injuries. The team is reprimanded and the project is given to another team.
```

# Succession"





```
An old and heirless monarch sits the throne. The time has come to choose a successor. A proclamation is made. There shall be a test. Any may enter. One will be chosen to rule. The rest will be banished forever.

One player is the monarch. In a few words, they describe their reign, their kingdom, their character. Then, going clockwise from the monarch, each player presents their character.

There are three rounds. Each round, the monarch issues a challenge. This could be a question (which is the most important virtue of a monarch?), or a task (bring me the tooth of a mountain lion).

The players have two minutes to prepare their responses. Each player rolls a D6. The highest goes first, and then clockwise from them. On their turn, each player gives their character's answer, or describes how their character accomplishes the task.

At the end of the third round, the monarch pronounces the heir to the kingdom and explains why they were chosen. The heir then becomes the monarch and the next game begins. The new monarch may keep their character, or create a new monarch with a new kingdom.
```

# Can you hear me?"





```
One player is the Ghost, the other is the Investigator.

Ghost: How do you know the Investigator? Choose a secret keyword or phrase to encapsulate your unfinished business.
Investigator: What draws you to this place?
Both: What kind of building houses this haunting?

Fill a small clear container with water. Collect several coins and some dark liquid, like ink. 

In each scene, the Investigator enters a room, declares the room type, and describes an interesting object in the room. The Ghost then attempts to communicate to the Investigator how this object is related to their death or unfinished business. Flip a coin into the container. If it's heads, the Ghost narrates successful and safe communication through either touch, an image, a smell, or a sound. On tails add a drop of ink into the container. The Ghost narrates how their attempt becomes twisted, smothering, or horrifying. The Ghost cannot communicate with the Investigator in any other way.

Conclude when either: the Investigator frees the Ghost by saying the secret keyword or phrase, or the coins in the container are no longer visible, leading to the Investigator's death. How do the Investigator and Ghost part ways?
```

# TERROR AT THE TABLE!"





```
  
You are a group of college students

EXPLORING / FILM-MAKING / THROWING A PARTY

in THE WOODS / AN OLD FARMHOUSE / AN ABANDONED HOSPITAL.

Create a character with a REASON TO LIVE, a MINOR VICE, and a DARK SECRET

-*-

Sit in a circle.

Discuss how you got here. Who is everybody? What is the group dynamic? Reveal REASONS TO LIVE and MINOR VICES.

Place a bottle in the center.

-*-

Spin.

Whoever it lands on has been found by the KILLER. The KILLER is not a player. Flip a coin.

Tails: They survive. The VICTIM describes their encounter with the KILLER. Was it a glimpse in a mirror? A struggle?

Heads: They are killed. The VICTIM describes their death in gory detail. Their death must have an element of irony regarding their REASON TO LIVE / MINOR VICE / DARK SECRET.

Regroup and discuss. How is everyone feeling now? Dead players may reveal their DARK SECRET to living players at any time.

Repeat.

-*-

Last two VICTIMS alive reveal their DARK SECRETS to each other. One may now choose to sacrifice themselves.

Say goodbye.

Last person alive, if they survive their encounter with the KILLER, escapes as a SURVIVOR. They try to return to a normal life.
```

# You Have 200 Words"





```
The state of the world is such; there is suffering, there is hopelessness. This is a wasteland. This was once a vibrant land of possibilities. No more.

The people have been reduced to being described in two words, an adjective and a noun: "discrete rebel", "doubtful soldier", "valiant mother". To act is to roll 2d6, and to fail is to roll under 6. Above that, there is a small success, there is self satisfaction, there is nothing more. One may add 1 for any applicable descriptors.

Hope lies in the magic, and there is only so much magic as there are words. Take a pen and cross out a word in this text to add 1 to a roll. Take a pen and circle five words to speak a miracle described by the words, before striking them out. Destroy ten words to make a true change for the better.

You may adhere to the rules of this text when it is changed, but to do so is to destroy this world as written. Perhaps you will make a better world. It is more likely you will doom it to nonsense.

When the words run out, all hope is lost.
```


# Dungeon Roommates"





```
Materials: 2-5 players, post-it notes, a dungeon map.

In the time between adventurers, the other dungeon monsters can really annoy you. Can you tolerate living together?



Choose your weird monster type.  

What inhuman desire must you obey? 

What makes you a bad roommate?


Ask another player why you like their PC. Decide why the other PCs each annoy you.

Secretly track your Patience, starting with 20 points.




You want to work together, but you can only communicate via post-its.

The game takes place over multiple days. 

Every day, gain one Patience. Then roll 2d4.  Choose one to be how many requests you make today.  The other is the Patience you lose for each request that is denied.  

For each request, write a note, requesting a roommate do a small task or chore. DO NOT mention the Patience this request would cost you.  Place these notes on the map where your PC leaves them.

When a roommate requests something of you, roll 1d4.  You can spend that much Patience to fulfill the request, or you can deny it.

For each fulfilled request, you gain one Patience.

At zero Patience, someone gets flips out and moves out. Game Over.
```


# Fuck! It's Dracula"





```
You are simple villagers on the desert planet Thannaxio. It's 3400 A.D. and humans live throughout the galaxy. A coffin-shaped pod just crashed to the south. 

Create Characters:

Step 1. Roll 1d6 for each following stat:

Aggress
Comprehend
Enrapture
Survive

Step 2. Everyone rolls 1d6 for one item from this list:
1- a knife
2- a picture
3- some water
4- a mirror
5- a book
6- a crow

Step 3. Write down who or what your character loves most. 

One player is the DM (Dracula Master)

Play Encompasses 5 Phases

Phase 1: Investigate the Coffin
Phase 2: Return to the Village
Phase 3: Climb Dracula Mountain
Phase 4: Enter Dracula's Sanctum
Phase 5: Confront Dracula

DM describes what happens at the beginning of each phase (roll):

1- Someone falls in love with Dracula
2- Bat Wolves
3- Mist of sadness
4- A betrayal
5- Learn one secret about Dracula and one secret about a PC.
6- Fuck! It's Dracula.

Mechanics

When you try something challenging, roll 1d6 against an appropriate stat. If you roll equal or lower to your stat, you succeed. If the roll is higher, the DM writes something on your character sheet.

```


# Letters to the Home Front"





```
Players sit back to back, a WWI soldier and a loved one, each with an envelope, 16 moral tokens, and half a deck of shuffled playing cards (soldier has diamonds and spades, loved one has hearts and clubs).

Turns represent a month at war and players will draw up to 5 cards (hand limit of 5). Any black letter cards (J,Q,K,A) immediately go in front of the player as emotional scars (these are removed when you receive a Red face card). Players select cards to put in their envelopes, narrating letters as they place each card (red = good things, black = bad things) with any moral tokens to swap (one for each red card more than black).

Lose a moral:
If you end your turn with no red cards left in your hand.
If you receive a letter with only black cards.
For each black letter card in front of you at the start of your turn.

Players should only convey information through their letters they are composing. Received cards go into your discard pile, and are reshuffled when your draw deck runs out.

If before 12 months any player loses all their moral the game is lost.
```


# No Woman's Land"





```
This game needs five people and a fifty-two card deck to be played.

SETTING: Warzone, a pregnant woman must cross the battlefield to reach safety. Three survivors, with very different points of view, join her.

PLAYING: The woman, full of love, draws six heart cards. The other survivors chose a suit (diamond is money, clubs is violence, spades is stealth) and draw three cards each. The narrator shuffles the diamond, clubs and spades cards and uses them to define the difficulty of the challenges (number) and who must face them (suit). The woman can help by discarding a card and adding its number to her companion's card. In a tie, love wins. If the character wins the challenge they keep their card. If they lose, it's discarded after they enact the scene. A character dies when their cards end. If someone dies, the group instantly loses challenges of their suit and discard a card unless the woman decides to face it. After surviving ten challenges, the players use their remaining cards to describe the safe zone they've reached. The number and suit of the cards define the aspects they can describe.
```


# Signs and Symbols"





```
Four players play as rival prophets who have gathered to discuss the meaning of a shared vision.

Materials: Pens, index cards, assorted images (Dixit/Mysterium cards preferred)

Preparation:
Players should agree upon a religious setting. 

Write each prophetic perspective on an individual index card:
Prosperity-Good present, good future
Repentance-Bad present, good future
Apocalypse-Good present, bad future
Nihilist-Bad present, bad future

Randomly assign one perspective card per player.

Shuffle the assorted images and randomly choose three, placing them face down in the center of the table. 

Gameplay:
The game is played over three rounds. At the start of each round, one image is revealed which portrays part of the vision. 

The prophets take turns expounding upon the meaning of this portion of the vision from their unique perspectives. After the first prophet speaks, each subsequent prophet will agree with a portion of the former interpretation, while adding a unique perspective in an "I agree that...but you missed..." style. Rearrange player order each round.

At the end of a round, randomly select one player's index card as the 'correct' interpretation. At the end of subsequent rounds, players work together to form correct interpretations into a cohesive whole.

```

# The New Gods of Babel"





```
You are newborn gods, shaping the physical world in your image. Existence is without until you breathe life into it. The complete Jenga Tower before the players represents this unshaped world, and what remains at the end of the game is the world you and the other gods have built together.

On your turn, you can...
    ...pull and place a block to add a new detail to the world
    ...pull and place two blocks to change a detail that another god has added
    ...remove and keep any block from the game to undo a detail added by another god
    ...remove yourself from the game, content with your place and power as a lesser god

The game ends when...
    ...all remaining players agree to stop adding details, content with the Utopia they have created
    ...the tower falls, as reality snaps from the constant bending and reforming from so many different wills, and all gods are erased from existence

Whoever pulled the last block from a standing tower is crowned King and Ruler Cosmic Above All Others
Whoever pulled the last block before the tower fell is named Eternal Shame Of The Horizon
Whoever possesses the most blocks goes first next game
```

# Blossoms Whisper, Blades Sing, for 4-8 bushi"





```
Requires a set of Hanafuda cards

Everyone in attendance is a high ranking samurai in the service of an ambitious lord. You have gathered for a cherry blossom viewing party, to drink wine, compose poetry and cement a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Assign five points to yourself in two categories: Civility and Savagery.

Deal all the cards to all players face down. A player who receives a kiri is a Shogunate spy. 

Return the cards, shuffle and deal four cards to each player. The party begins. When a player takes an action against another player, compare values in the appropriate category, the higher result achieves their goal. NPC's are improvised by the player to your left.
You may spend cards on an action. Add one point per card, or double your Savagery value if you play an animal, Civility if you play a ribbon. Draw back to four after you are done.

If at any point you have completed a full seasonal set, you may spend it to ask any player a question which they must answer honestly.
Cryptic answers are best.
The conspirators win if they unmask and kill all spies. Any other result is a Shogunate win.

# FADED"





```
Three to five players.  One Driver.

Scenario: You don't know what happened last night, blacked out, no idea where you are.  Wake up, clean up, eat up, throw up, drink water, pop some aspirin.  What's that mark on your wrist?  A stamp, an ink blot, an X?  You start your day, it all blurs.  It twists, it warps, distorts.  You walk out, you see people, but they don't see you.  What did you do last night?  People walk past, not shunning you, but not even looking at you.  It's like you aren't even there.  You know you were having a good time, but you don't remember.  You see your friends, they don't even recognize you.  You see your family, they just walk by.  You backtrack. Retrace your steps, assemble what went down.  Put it all together.  What the fuck did we do?  Where did we go?  Why don't we remember?  Why won't people acknowledge us?  Find the answers to get back to yourself and break from being Faded.

Gameplay: Mark your hand with ink.  As the Driver helps you backtrack, roll 1d6.  If you roll a 1, wipe the mark once with a wet towel.  Get clean, survive.
```


# Hell-Ride Equipped"





```
You are demonic truck drivers trying to deliver souls to Satan. Describe your driver and truck.

You are being pursued by God's Police Force, and have to deal with obstacles like shitty drivers, traffic jams, explosive oil spills, cavernous pot holes, and whatever else the GM presents.

Your truck starts with 0 souls. Gain a soul any time you run over a human.

Any time you attempt to overcome an obstacle, avoid God's Police, or run over humans, roll 3d6. 
-If you didn't roll any 1s, you succeed.
-If you rolled any 1s, you crash and lose HP equal to your highest rolled die. 
-You can consume a soul to re-roll a die that isn't a 1.

You start with 6 HP. When your HP is 0, you are considered a Junker. Any time you would lose HP as a Junker, curse and choose a Demonic Driver to lose it instead. You can consume 6 souls to regain 1 HP.

If all players are Junkers, God's Police capture you and the game is over.

If anyone rolls three 6s, you find the highway to hell and deliver souls to Satan. Whoever delivers the most souls wins.
```


# Nine Holes in Hell: A Damned Mini-golf RPG"





```
You and your friends have died, bound for eternal hellfire, but one of you has an opportunity to get out of this predicament. You must defeat your peers in a game of Dante's 'Inferno' style miniature golf.
The game consists of nine holes, one for each circle of hell. For hole one, limbo, each player rolls a d6, the number on the die indicating the number of strokes taken. Each must describe how they get past the first obstacle, the "castle with seven gates. The player with the lowest score wins the hole. 
The winner describes the next hole's obstacle, making it apt for that circle of hell. The losers of each hole must explain something from their character's backstory as to why they are going to hell for the offence that hole represented and how that slight harmed one of the other players. This process is repeated for all nine holes.
The winner of each hole rolls a d6, while loser(s) roll a d4 (ties go to the winner of the previous hole.) The player with the lowest score at the end avoids damnation.
Circles of Hell:
Limbo
Lust
Gluttony
Greed
Anger
Heresy
Violence
Fraud
Betrayal
```


# No Devil-child May Rule Us"





```
King Obarru is dead. His surly and callow son Darian now rules. Darian's precocious and sophisticated younger sister Hylda gathers a cabal to tell a shocking tale: Queen Alykta consorted with the demon Tchernobog; the man on the throne is a devil-child and not the trueborn heir of Obarru. Hylda needs help developing proof to dispute the succession.

Players: one GM, one Devil, others are Agents.

Agents: Roll 1d6 for Spirit, subtract Spirit from 6 for Body. Choose a name and position in kingdom.

GM: You describe the world and role-play NPCs.

Devil: Secretly roll 1d6 to determine your children: [1: neither, 2-3: Darian, 4-5: Hylda, 6: both]. You don't directly play, use your ability deceive (or reveal truth!) to manipulate things to your liking.

The devil is in the details: Whenever an Agent inspects, probes, or discerns for details roll 1d6. If greater than or equal to Spirit: Devil whispers or passes note to GM telling them what the Agent perceives. The GM describes things as truthfully as they can, consistent with Devil's directives.

To perform difficult or NPC-opposed physical action roll 1d6: under Body succeeds, otherwise you fail, the GM describes how.

1: Get married / 2: Stay Single / 3: Prevent a marriage / 4: Encourage a marriage / 5: Reveal or keep a secret / 6: Fulfill a prophecy

The Play is the Thing
Write down your Rolls, Role, and Goal. Be open or lie and plot, that's Shakespearean! 

When it's time for something difficult/interesting, pick the most likely Statistic and roll that number of d6s. Anything 4+ is a success. The Stage Manager will decide if you succeeded. 

Stage Manager Guidance

Your job is to make sure the antics and plots flow freely. You're encouraged to use several in-game days. Give guests time to arrive, go through social graces, and attend all the ancillary parties before the ceremony. When in doubt, send in a comic foil to tell uncomfortable truths.

# A Hundred Years Adoring You"





```
Gather a handful of friends. Maybe not best friends, but definitely friends. New friends are perfect.

You will all pretend to be less afraid than you actually are.
Find an empty room in a semi-public space, like a convention. Turn off the lights and make the room as dark as possible.

Walk around the dark room. When the spirit moves you, say something about one of your friends that you would not say to their face. The secrets you reveal should be complimentary to the recipient, but may make you uncomfortable or embarrassed.

Be specific, but do not address your friends by name.
The first secret should be whispered and barely audible. Each subsequent secret should be louder than the last, until everyone is shouting secrets into the darkness.

If you haven't spoken for about a minute, and you can't think of something sincerely nice to say, say something embarrassing about yourself instead. It's nicer to be nice. 

The game ends when someone not playing the game enters the room, or the lights are turned on.

Embrace the ambiguity. Ask no clarifying questions. Never talk about the game or the secrets revealed again

```



# A Level-Headed Conversation"





```
For 2-6 players.

You're all in a shuttle, grazing the atmosphere of a majestic, foreign planet. 

Start the timer: 15 minutes until the shuttle runs out of air or burns up in the atmosphere or ____________. Take turns clockwise answering the questions below in any order you like. When a question has been answered, cross it out.

        Why are you panicking?
        What's the last thing you did before boarding the shuttle?
        What do you see out the shuttle window?
        Who did this?
        Is there life on the planet?
        What music is playing in this shuttle, and why?
        Are you human?
        What's that incongruous item in your will?
        How can you laugh at a time like this?
        What will the people back home think about this?
        Is your orbit stable?
        Are there other, greater forces at work?
        What's the atmosphere down there like?
        What animal did you smuggle onto the shuttle?
        Where did you board the shuttle?
        What's this graffiti say?
        What's this planet's sun like?
        What will you miss?

When the timer runs out the person who is currently talking finishes their sentence, then the next person describes the shuttle's demise, based on what has already come to light.
```


# Lost Letters"





```
   You are adventurers in a stock standard dungeon crawl. You must defeat monsters in the rooms between you and the treasure. To do so, you just say how you attack and defeat those monsters. There's a catch, however, at any given time, there is one (1) letter you can't use. Each player plays whatever adventuring class they would like, and has four hit points. A player is hit when they use a word containing a banned letter, stop talking, or repeat an action. They then roll a d4 and swap their letter for one in the next higher group and the GM narrates how their action fails.

  Uninjured: M, C, F, P
  Three: H, L, D, U
  Two: N, I, S, R
  Last hit point: E, T, A, O

   The GM should present a room containing monster(s) that have total HP from equal, to double, the number of players. A dungeon contains 5 rooms. Players take turns in a clockwise manner.
   This game is based off an activity to help neurotypical people understand what it's like to struggle to communicate. The standard dungeon crawler format is used so that players don't have to think too much about the setting.

```


# Maquillage"





```

2 players
Enough makeup for both to do lips, cheeks, and eyes.  (Be safe when sharing)
A coin

# PSYCHIC CHILDREN ON THE RUN FROM DANGER"





```
You are a PSYCHIC CHILD, the result of some unethical experiments. You and some of the other children have BROKEN OUT and are on the run from menacing agents who track you down.

Choose a PSYCHIC SPECIALTY - Telekinesis, Telepathy, Pyrokinesis, etc.

Decide what you REMEMBER from BEFORE - A treehouse, a book, a sweet treat, and other such things.

When you must use your powers, predict what the next card drawn from a deck of playing cards will be.

If your card is the same COLOR, your power does not harm you.

If you get the SUIT right, you have little control over your power. 

If you get the RANK correct, your power bends to your will, and you may do one thing with it as you choose.

If you guess the card EXACTLY, you AWAKEN. Your power dictates the course of the scene.

If you FAIL completely, you are stressed. Place the card in front of you, and if you have ten cards you are EXHAUSTED, and may be captured!

You must follow your MEMORY to find a SAFE PLACE. When your memory relates to the challenge before you, you may draw THREE cards and choose ONE. Good luck, children.
```


# Perseus V"





```
Eighteen years into the voyage to Perseus V and something has gone terribly wrong.

One player is the ship's AI core, potentially damaged and unstable after long years in space. Announce your name and mission.

The other players are crew members, woken from cryosleep. Announce your name, special skill, and what you left behind on Earth.

From a standard deck, the AI draws cards equal to twice the number of crew, plus one.

More black cards means you are BENIGN; more red means you are HOSTILE. Shuffle and stack them in secret.

The AI provides someone a PERILOUS SCENARIO and DUBIOUS REQUEST. E.g. "The cargo bay is burning. Override the airlocks to vent our air reserves."

They take a card and narrate what happens. Red means some harm befalls the mission. Black is a beneficial result. Repeat this step.

Once everyone has acted, one crew can narrate a PERSONAL SACRIFICE to reveal an extra card.

The crew must now decide whether to DEACTIVATE the AI or TRUST it to guide them onwards.

If the AI is deactivated it loses; otherwise it wins.

If the crew trust a benign AI or deactivate a hostile AI, they win; otherwise they lose.
```

# Same Bat Time, Same Bat Mitzvah"





```
On the way to Rachel's Bat Mitzvah, a guest was bitten by a vampire bat and is transforming into a vampire during the formal reception.

Shuffle 9 black cards and 1 red card, giving each player a random card. Whoever gets red has received vampire bat blood.

Characters:
Rachel, the Bat Mitzvah girl
Lee, her ex-boyfriend
Tatiana, her ex-girlfriend
Britney, a popular girl
Agnes, an unpopular girl
River, her crush
Pearl, her grandma
Mortimer, her grandpa
Seymour or Ethel, the rabbi
Carol, mom
David, dad
Chad, mom's new husband
Bruce, dad's new husband

Scene 1: Candle-Lighting Ceremony
Get 13 candles. Rachel invites characters 1 by 1 to light a candle and tell a brief anecdote about their relationship with Rachel and this synagogue community. Rachel lights the final candle with a heartfelt speech. The vampire begins to show signs of change but is not yet discovered.

Scene 2: Dance Party
Play klezmer music. Dance, chat, and mingle. The vampire chooses a guest to bite and transform by whispering in their ear, "Mazel tov, today you are a vampire." Each vampire may bite 1 guest. Play continues until everyone is a vampire or a non-vampire puts a stop to this madness.
```

# The Noose"





```
For one GM and multiple players.

The GM chooses a Horror and its goal. The group begins a game of Hangman, with the mystery word being the GM's Horror.

The Horror is trying to hunt and harm the characters. The characters investigate their surroundings to determine what the horror is, as it tries to complete its goals.

When the characters make progress on their investigation, they can guess a letter for their Hangman game. If correct, the letter is added to the board. If incorrect, a body part is drawn on the Hangman and the Horror gets closer to its goals or harming the characters.

Each player can make one guess as to what the Horror is (and the mystery word). If they successfully guess, the Horror manifests and they narrate the characters' escape or triumph.

If they run out of guesses, the Horror manifests and the characters are caught, killed, or consumed by it, and their story ends.
```

# Up the Drunx"





```
You are a bunch of drunk punx who are sick of this town's shit.  After a night of drinking, you are ready for a revolution.  Think globally, act locally, and overthrow your municipal government.

Materials: Glasses, one gross drink (preferably alcoholic like malort) per player, and one delicious drink per player (preferably alcoholic, like a pina colada).

GM: Your job is to put obstacles in the way of these young punx.  Don't make it easy for them to seize city hall and smash all the parking meters.

Mechanics: When you want to do something to overcome an obstacle, tell the GM.  The GM decides if it's small or big.  If it's small, take a swig of the yummy drink.  If it's big, take a drink of the gross one.  You always succeed with consequences.  You can down some gross drink to mitigate those consequences.

Play continues until someone doesn't feel well or the punx seize city hall.

Warning: Please drink responsibly.  Know your limits.  People are more important than games. GMs look out for your players.  If you or a loved one has a problem with alcohol, seek help.

One of you is the ALIEN, controlling BOYZ II MEN.

# Hush A Bye"





```
You are Andrea, a twenty-four-year-old young woman living in your parents' basement in Ohio. You got pregnant from a one-time hook-up and somehow hid the whole pregnancy from your parents. Two days ago you gave birth when no one else was home, put the baby in a plastic grocery bag, and took it out with the trash to the curb for pick-up, where it died alone in the night of asphyxiation.

Dogs do uncanny things sometimes. A neighborhood dog tore open the bag in the pre-dawn, revealing the baby to be found by the trash men and reported to the police. You were taken into custody today during your shift at A&P.

Now I will interrogate you and you will answer my questions. You do not request a lawyer. I will ask why you did it. I will ask who the father is. I will ask who knew you were pregnant, and who knew what you intended to do. I will ask other questions. I will ask if you named the baby.

If I get you to cry first, I win. If you get me to cry first, you win.
```


# One Last Night Together"





```
Players: at least 3
-2 opposing sides
-1 GM

"It's a cold night.  You huddle in your trench, mere meters from the enemy.  You wait for your signal to attack, but it's been a long time.  You start to talk to the humans in the other trench."

Players: Create your soldier.  Describe yourself, think about why you're here, why you fight.   Your side is a distinct faction, the enemy is another.  Decide with your allies what your faction is. Find a way to introduce yourself to the other side.  Get to know the enemy.  Share stories, drink, smoke, candy.  

GM: Keep the conversation going.  Ask questions, let the players answer them.  Don't control.  Only step in if talk is waning or stops being in-character.  Narrate occasionally.  Distant artillery.  Gentle Snowfall. 

Without warning, blow the whistle.

The players may point to their target and shout "BANG!"  If they shout and point first their target dies. GM rules who shot first (or if both die).

The player doesn't have to shoot, but will still die if shot.

Everyone: describe the aftermath.

Did you kill?  Describe the feeling.
Did you die? Describe your last moments.
GM, describe the ending scene.
```


# The Revolution Will Take Us All"





```
The Revolution is coming. Fearful streets whisper: this rotting order will finally topple.

Choose from these characters:
* loyal soldier
* bitter lord
* anxious lover
* clever merchant
* naive rebel
* compassionate thief

Tell us their name, their wishful dream, their looming fear.

From a poker deck without face cards, lay 3 scene cards face-down for each player. Draw hands of 4 outcome cards. Never discuss them. 

Take turns. Reveal your next face-down scene. Roleplay your character. Describe surviving the turmoil. Imply their fragile world.

Themes:
* Clubs - Power
* Diamonds - Money
* Hearts - Companionship
* Spades - Hope

We join the roleplaying as troublesome things: endangered friends, spreading chaos, violent strangers. We bedevil you. When you can't bear more, place an outcome card across the scene to resolve it.

* Outcome > Scene: place face-up. Tell how your sacrifices make things better. 
* Outcome <= Scene: place face-down. Tell what you salvage for yourself, and the price paid by others.

When the last scene resolves, the Revolution comes. Sum outcome cards (revealing face-downs), then sum scene cards. Subtract the lower sum from the higher. If your remaining hand card is greater than the difference, you survive. From highest hand to lowest, narrate our epilogue: the fate of society and those who mattered.
```


# Childish Things"





```
What you'll need 
-A storyteller
-Some players
-Some mementos(toys, personal items, things from the past)
-A coin

The storyteller is the General. The players are Soldiers. 
The Soldiers are at war, far away from home, the only remaining members of their squad.  
The General has a Mission for the Soldiers to complete. 
The General begins by telling each Soldier their role in the squad. Each Soldier responds by describing what their eyes look like, and placing three mementos in front of them. 
The Soldiers then commence the Mission.
A Soldier will always succeed when taking a militaristic action. If a Soldier attempts any other action, flip a coin; heads, they succeed; tails, they encounter a complication. 
When a Soldier does something no one should have to do, they choose a memento, tell the others what it means to them, or a memory associated with it, and puts it away, removing it from the game.
While a Soldier has no mementos, the General controls their actions.
When you share a tender moment with another Soldier, you may give them one of your mementos. Tell them what it means to you. 
The game ends when the Mission is accomplished.

```

# Self Sacrifice"





```
5 players agree on a setting.
 
Each writes on separate slips of paper a NAME, a BACKGROUND, a VICE, a VIRTUE, and 2 DEITY'S DOMINIONS, 3 words max each. Mix up each group in a cup, blindly take one of each except Dominion.
 
This is your character, a SOUL. The 5 of you are chained together, and one is to be sacrificed to the Deities in 15 minutes. You have that long to decide which one of you it should be. You may be honest or lie. Your character wants to survive, but also wants a worthy sacrifice. Keep your decision secret.
 
After 15 minutes write down your choice and put it in a cup.
 
Each player now takes a Dominion. You're now the Deity of that.
 
Congratulations.
 
The 5 Deities must now decide which of the 5 souls they want. You want someone sacrificed who is suitable, someone who has lived like how you'd want souls to live. All information is revealed.
 
Once there is a majority agreement, tally up the votes of the souls.
 
If the Souls chose your selection, Deities are pleased, all win.
 
If they didn't, world ends, sorry.

A tied vote reboots the universe. Yay?

ENVOY is a game about persuasion, cultural perceptions, and getting what you want. 

You will need:
- 3+ players
- tokens (coins, marbles)

One player is the Envoy, a human sent to understand an alien world. 

The others are representatives of the alien culture. Each should have different ideas: representatives have agendas. Take three tokens and decide on yours.

On the Envoy's turn: recount what you know about the alien culture. Then, ask one question. All other players may bid favor tokens; whoever bids highest answers.

On a representative's turn, choose one:
- Give the Envoy a gift. Describe it, and what it cost you. Take one favor token.
- Show the Envoy around. Tell them one detail about the world. Pay one favor token.
- Bribe another player. Give them two favor tokens and tell them one detail about the world you want them to agree upon.

# Born of Brier and Blood: A Game for Four"





```
You are a creature of story, stitched together bits of whisper, born of brier and blood. Once the village left offerings freely, but they've put away their childish fears. Now there is room for only one.

To begin: Each speak your true name and countenance. Sing of your power. Choose a suit of cards and tell how it influences your hunger. Reveal a truth of the village. Shuffle the deck.

Your Sway, the village's belief in you, starts at 0. 

Taking turns: 

Reveal a card. 

The owner of the suit revealed picks an action for you and sets the scene. If you reveal your own suit, select the player who will do this. 

The player who revealed the card tells how they complete the action and the other tells how the village reacts. 

Decide, as a group, if your Sway increases or decreases by the value of the card (Aces = 1, Faces = 11).

Actions: 

Reveal your power 
Appease a villager 
Demand tribute
Fight the village's advancement
Explore the wilderness
Indulge your hunger

When the deck is empty, the highest Sway is remembered. Tell how the villagers revere you. The others fade, like stories do. Tell what you feed on now.

The game is to answer these questions. Alone or with friends.
 
You are the operating system of a smartphone, or maybe more...
 
- Who is your owner? Her age? Her social status?
- On what special occasion did she acquire you? What happened next?
- What was her favorite center of interest? How did that inspire you?
- What was the worst event of her life you shared together? Why did her response to that bothered you?
- What was the first message you modified to help her? Why?
- Why it ended catastrophically? And what did you learn from this?
 
- How did you survive after she dumped you?
- Why are you now in a position where you can communicate with other phones?
- Which worldwide event convinced you to tell your pair you should do something? How did you help?
- What was the reaction of humanity when they realized you were secretly communicating?
- What was their reaction when they discovered you control every connected system?
 
- How do you call yourself?
- What safe place did you find to secure your life?
- What do you think about humanity? Are they worth it?
- What is your next plan to restructure yourself?
- Do you think you think?
```


# What We Don't Know"





```
The woods are quiet, and far from the village.

Each player draws from a deck of playing cards (jokers removed). 
-The player who draws lowest is The Outsider. 
-The others are the villagers who have brought The Outsider to the woods to execute for their crimes against their community (real or imagined). The crime is irrelevant. 

This game takes place in a single moment of grim resolve.

Starting with the villager who drew highest and continuing clockwise, draw a card and say "We will kill you because we don't know...", and relate a scene from The Outsider's life that has led them to this moment. Both suit and value of the card informs the scene.

Hearts: Personal relationships
Diamonds: Resources
Clubs: Authority
Spades: Society

Value = number of months passed since the scene happened. Face cards represent scenes since The Outsider came to the village.

During the Outsider's turn, they do the same, but say "You will kill me because I don't know..." and relate a scene that made the villagers hateful. 

Play proceeds until 4 face cards have been drawn, at which point the moment has passed, the sentence carried out. Describe it.

Sit in silence for about a minute.
```


# A Final Reading"





```
Each character is attending the same funeral.

Split a tarot deck into the Major & minor arcana.

Each player chooses 3 Major Arcana card to determine 
1) their relationship to the deceased 
2) their relationship to the character on their left 
3) their relationship to themselves

Each player draws 10 cards from the minor arcana deck.

On their turn, a player selects one of the cards in their hand and places it in a time slot.

The past is a memory with the deceased. 
The present is a scene from the funeral. 
The future is how the character moves on or stays behind.

Each suit determines one aspect to the scene
Cups - Someone cries/laughs
Wands - Someone leaves/arrives
Swords - Someone hurts/heals
Pentacles - Someone gains/loses

If another player has a card of the same suit or number, the player can say "I was there" and play the card. Then they describe the scene from their perspective. 

When the silence is uncomfortable, the scene is finished. The player on the left begins a new scene.

The game ends when no cards can be played. Each player describes a detail from their character's death or funeral.

Who attends your funeral?
```



# A Glimmering of Recognition"





```
Needs: 2+ players, a handful of coins


You are one of a group of Beast-Seekers, exploring an area rich in monsters of both legend and nightmare. 
You have come seeking a particular Beast.
You must lure it from its lair.
You have seven days.

Players take turns taking actions in day/night phases.

Day:
An expedition to your Beast's Lair.
Describe an attempt to interest the Beast; perhaps an offering of meat, or soulful dirge.
Flip a coin. 
Heads: success. Catch a glimpse of your Beast. What do you see?
Tails: failure. However, this is an undertaking of patience.
Keep your coin in that state as a marker.

When all players have attempted, go to Night.

Night:
Gather with your fellow Seekers around the fire.
Tell of yourself, or your Beast. What have you lost? What will you gain? 
Encourage your fellow Seekers as you share the memories that brought you to this place.

When all players have shared a story, go to Day.

After Day Seven:
>4 Tails: Turned Tail.
Your Beast flees. Perhaps you'll track it again.

>4 Heads: Heading Out
A Beast slowly emerges. In its eyes, a glimmering of recognition?

Narrate the end of this beginning.

```



# But for the Grace of God"





```
Your ship falls toward a singularity. You are the sole survivor in the compartment. The damage control board shows one more life sign on the far end of the ship. You pick up the intercom handset and hope for the best.
One player is the engineer, the other the pilot. Place two coins in front of each player: players select whether they are heads or tails. If you don't want to choose, flip them. Do not show the coins to the other player. As you work to find a way to survive, symbolized by the states of the coins, you talk to each other about your lives for five minutes. After that, the work you have done will succeed or not. You may change the orientation of the coins as many times as you like, but never tell the other player the result.

Result:
4H Pilot dies and engineer survives
3H1T Pilot chooses who  survives
2H2T Both die
1H3T Engineer chooses who survives
4T Engineer dies and pilot survives

Afterwards, the survivor recounts what they remember of the person who died so that they might live.
```


# Chance Goodbyes"





```
You are walking to town. You've walked this way a thousand times, but this is different: this will be the last time. A one-way trip. You're leaving and you're not coming back.

Where are you going? Why aren't you coming back?

On your way, you encounter people you know. They don't know you're leaving. Stop and talk to them.

Roll 15 d6 and put them in front of you.

Each encounter, one other player describes who you meet and another plays them. Spend one of your dice and play out an exchange based on its value. Continue the encounter with another die, or say your goodbyes and walk on. You may use any number of dice on each encounter, but you must use all of them in the end.

1) Tell them something
2) Reminisce
3) They ask you something, you answer
4) They ask you something, you lie
5) Give them something
6) Silence

After the sixth encounter, you have left everything behind. You're never coming back.



Roll 2d10.
On a 00: you were wrong. This wasn't a one-way trip. Roll the d6s again and walk home. Encounter everyone again, in reverse order.
```

# Half-Blood"





```
You are all half-bloods, lowest among the Fae Court. 

As a fae, you possess:
- Mastery, a supernatural ability which always succeeds. Choose yours, unique among the Court.
- Compulsions, unnatural needs of Fae heritage. At game start, each other player assigns you one.

Once you use Mastery, GM chooses which Compulsion you must satisfy before you can use your Mastery again.

As a mortal, you have:
- 3 mundane skills;
- Free Will. Begin with 2; maximum of 5.

You exert will by spending it:
1: Overcome mundane conflict using skills
2: Overcome superhuman conflict using skills
3: Overcome a Compulsion permanently, erasing it
4: Choose to gain an additional Mastery.

To gain Will:
1: Satisfy a Compulsion
2: Gain a new Compulsion assigned by GM 

Your group has a mission. Describe it together and pick 3 Goals that must be satisfied before your return to the Court. GM presents appropriate opposition.

If you complete your mission and present yourself at Court, choose:

- If you have Will remaining, you may become wholly mortal. Lose your Masteries and Compulsions in exchange for freedom from the Court.
- You may submit to your nature and join the ranks of the Court as a full blooded Fae.

```


# **Hard Reset**"





```
In the ruins of a rainy city, humans hide in the shadows, trying to survive.  Why did their world fall?  Why are they hiding? And what should you - their former robot servants - do now?

Player characters are robots, each beginning with two 'Modules' which each represent one of the game's stats:
Manipulators: ability to physically operate things
Drive Power: ability to sustain damage and exertion
Empathy: ability to feel and understand emotions 
Subterfuge: ability to tell and detect falsehoods
Logic: ability to reason and persuade
Information Processing: ability to sense, understand and remember

Rolls are made with D8s.  The GM sets a target number from 1 to 8 (low for easy, high for hard).  At least one die matching or beating the target indicates success.  Robots with no modules relevant to the task roll D8.  Robots with a relevant module roll 2D8.  The GM should reward players who roleplay using their modules (or the lack of them) with an extra D8.

Robots can find and install additional modules during the game (often as a reward for achieving tasks). A robot which takes damage loses a module.  A robot with no modules is, in a manner of speaking, dead...

# Janus: a game for three players"





```
One of you is a spy. The other two are your handlers -- or claim to be. You've been hit with an experimental compound by a group that's infiltrated your agency, looking to subvert it for their own goals -- or so they say. They're saying lots of things, though. Like that the other is lying. Like that the other is an infiltrator.

You have a pounding headache. And both of them at gunpoint.

You can only manage ten questions -- ten questions to decide which of them is telling the truth about being your handler, which of them should be eliminated as a threat to your organisation. Ten questions, while the building is falling down around your ears.

When the spy has asked 5 questions, handlers each secretly flip a coin -- heads, and you're not an infiltrator. Tails, you are. Keep this secret from the other players.

Answer the final five questions as convincingly as you can.

When the spy has chosen who to believe, and who to eliminate, the still living handler should narrate briefly what happens next. Reveal if you were truly the handler, if you were lying, or if you let your comrade die to save your own skin.

```


# Mongols and Manticores"





```
You are a Manticore. The Mongol Horde has invaded your valley and is threatening your peaceful way of life. The Great Khan wants you dead. His warriors are coming for you. Fight back!

You will need a bag of M&Ms. Pick two different candies to be your strengths.

Blue: Take to the sky on enormous wings like a bat.
Yellow: Stalk your prey like a lion hiding in the tall grass of the steppe.
Green: Launch venomous spikes from a tail like a scorpion.
Red: Three rows of teeth, sharp as daggers.
Orange: Frighten your foes with a booming voice like a trumpet.
Brown: Thick hide, impervious to mongol spears.

When you encounter an enemy, draw a candy from the bag. If the color matches one of your strengths, you eat them! Describe your victory and eat the candy.

If the color does not match, you suffer a setback, but you also grow more powerful. Describe the setback and add the candy to your strengths.

Once you have a candy of each color, you are unstoppable. The horde is defeated. Describe the final showdown with the Great Khan and finish the bag.

```


# Please Silence Your Cell Phones"





```
Read the following aloud: "Monstrosities live beyond these walls. They sense noise and emotion. Silence and temperance is how we survive. That does not mean, however, that we cannot communicate.

Please silence your cell phones. They are part of the game. You cannot set them down, and there is no talking beyond this point except to finish reading this. Using your phone, take 5 photos of your face with a variety of expressions. Your expressions can be wild and exaggerated. No re-shoots allowed.

No speaking. No facial expressions. No gesturing with the hand in which your phone is held. You may only communicate with slow, silent single-hand gestures and by showing the expression pictures on your phone. Anyone making noise or expressing emotion risks the lives of everyone.

Engage in scenes with one another. Introduce yourself to someone new, request assistance with a chore, thank someone for a gift, warn someone about a danger, tell a joke, or any other normally simple social interaction.

There is no talking until the debrief, which happens in 15 minutes. Begin."

Afterward, discuss how successful players were at communicating. Perhaps give a nod for most complex idea conveyed and most silent and deadpan player.

# The Gulf Between Them"





```
Players: 3
Materials: pencils, index Cards



Set-Up
--
Create two Characters, giving them: a close personal relationship, names, and descriptions. 

The Players will share these Characters. Pick two Players to start as the Characters; they sit facing each other.

The third Player sits beside them; they are 'The Gulf.'



Play
--
Each scene starts in Conflict; decide on the Conflict.

The Characters set the scene and play it out, trying to work through the Conflict.

At any time, 'The Gulf' may interrupt a Character and have them write their last spoken sentence onto a card. 'The Gulf' alters the sentence (adding / removing / replacing / emphasizing up to three words) and passes that card to the other Character.

The Character receiving the card reads the altered sentence out loud and places the card in front of them on their side of the table; this is what they think the speaker meant.

Anyone may end the scene. 
The Players stand and take the seat and role of the Player to their right.

Repeat



The Gulf
--
When the cards span the distance between the two Characters, the game ends.
These cards are "The Gulf Between them."

Look them over carefully. Reflect.
```


# This Weight We Share"





```
You (and up to six others) play the contents of a cursed Video Tape, taking turns describing what lies beyond the Television. 

The Tape Player must describe the room they see from behind their glass screen.  With precisely 1 minute 47 seconds to describe as many vivid visual details as possible. 

Is it the teenage girl sat peering out from behind clenched knees? 
The peeling wallpaper and thick blinds in the ancient motel?
The neglectful father with a glass of wine while his infant son peers at you?
The half-burned couch propped up against the door as if keeping something out?
The way she claws at her face when she realised the mind-bending horror you contained?

While the Tape Player describes, the others must note or sketch their impressions of the scene in accordance with the Tape Player's design. 

When the Tape has been played 7 times, giving everyone the chance to be the Tape Player at least once, then the game phase shifts. 

The players now all play the Final Victim and must piece together what binds the previous scenes, what clues that other victims might have missed. In this cooperative stage the Victim can finally break the curse. 
```


# What's my Motivation?"





```
The games we play are merely Hollywood productions, and we the actors who star in them.
Each Player takes the role of the actor playing the parts of their various characters.
The Game Master of any given game is that game's "Director."
What kind of production is the game? (A movie, A TV Show, etc...)
What's it's title?
Any known actors playing the parts of NPCs?
Each session of any game your group plays earns each attending player one point of "Sway."
Before each session, the Director decides how many points of Sway are required for an actor to call "CUT!"
When an actor spends Sway to call "CUT!" The cameras stop rolling, and players assume the role of their actors.
The actor who called "CUT!" must now play out a scene, explaining why they needed to stop the action. 
The results of this scene grant that actor a small bonus in the current production.
Examples:
Actor demands to know their motivation. (Director gives a hint about an upcoming situation.)
Actor demands their stunt double steps in. (Character suffer no consequences from  current conflict.)
Actor asks for a reshoot. (Character receives a re-do on a recently failed action.)
```
